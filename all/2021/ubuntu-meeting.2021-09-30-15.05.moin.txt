 15:06 <mclemenceau> \o/ thx xypron

 15:06 <xypron> Working on OpenSBI reset,

 15:06 <xypron> investigating linker generated lists

 15:06 <xypron> ran into problems with bintutils ignoring KEEP in a linker script

 15:07 <xypron> New vim has been released, fianally showing "impish" as no errror in changelog

 15:07 <xypron> <done>

 15:07 <dbungert> * subiquity - roadmap planning for JJ

 15:07 <dbungert> * subiquity/u-d-i - continue on v2 storage.  Adding final details, automated

 15:07 <dbungert> testing, fixing issues.  Expect it ready for review late Monday.

 15:07 <dbungert> * curtin - prep for a small curtin release to support MAAS with two fixed they

 15:07 <dbungert> want.  Either a targeted release that gets SRUed to focal, or MAAS is willing

 15:07 <dbungert> to use a build from a PPA.

 15:07 <dbungert> * livecd-rootfs/u-d-i - investigate problem with install type layers causing

 15:07 <dbungert> the standard install to fail, but not minimal.  Fix the type declaration in

 15:07 <dbungert> the catalog of install types.  Thanks to seb & mwhudson for heavy guidance

 15:07 <dbungert> for the fix.

 15:07 <dbungert> * subiquity - fix the deserializer.  This enables callers of the API to send

 15:07 <dbungert> partial objects when those objects have default values defined for the

 15:07 <dbungert> omitted fields.

 15:14 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-hh-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <mclemenceau> nothing for foundations

 15:14 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:15 <slyon> nothing

 15:15 <mclemenceau> alright let's look at Impish too

 15:15 <mclemenceau> #topic Release incoming bugs (impish)

 15:15 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ii-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:16 <mclemenceau> there's a few here

 15:16 <mclemenceau> LP: #1943077

 15:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1943077 in squashfs-tools (Ubuntu) "snapd fails to autopkgtest on mksquashfs, which is looking for libgcc_s" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1943077

 15:17 <juliank> looks like an issue to solve in snapd?

 15:17 <dbungert> yes, snapd should see a new upload based on picking up libgcc, snapd team is talking about doing so

 15:18 <mclemenceau> ok snapd team is working on that one

 15:19 <mclemenceau> LP: #1943816

 15:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1943816 in OEM Priority Project "'ubuntu-drivers install' needs to be used when installing nvidia-driver if enabling 'third-party packages'" [Critical, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1943816

 15:21 <mclemenceau> Looks like bug may affect both ubiquity and ubuntu-drivers-common

 15:22 <mclemenceau> let's leave it in seb and alberto's end. keep it tagged ii so we can double check next week

 15:23 <mclemenceau> next LP: #1944519

 15:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1944519 in casper (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu Mate shutdown prompt is missing - system reboots at once" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1944519

 15:25 <mclemenceau> with the release coming up soon, we should give it a look, let's card it

 15:25 <mclemenceau> last for impish LP: #1944004

 15:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1944004 in livecd-rootfs (Ubuntu) "snapd.seeded.service never finishes on non-amd64" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1944004

 15:27 <vorlon> this one should definitely be fixed for impish; however I sponsored the livecd-rootfs upload already

 15:28 <vorlon> so I think this might be fix-released but we were missing a bug ref in the changelog

 15:28 <vorlon> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/livecd-rootfs/2.741

 15:28 <vorlon> is in impish release but didn't auto-close the bug

 15:29 <ginggs> syntax error in changelog

 15:29 <mclemenceau> and that's it for bugs

 15:29 <mclemenceau> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:29 <mclemenceau> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:29 <mclemenceau> vorlon you're up

 15:30 <vorlon> ginggs: I assume it didn't like it due to the missing space; amusingly, launchpad UI has no problem and still makes it a link

 15:30 * vorlon nods

 15:30 <vorlon> openssh stuck for 30 days

 15:30 <vorlon> who was working on this? :)

 15:30 <jawn-smith> that's me!

 15:30 <jawn-smith> I have a patch uploaded to LP: #1944621

 15:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1944621 in openssh (Ubuntu) "sshd in chroot has regression with glibc 2.34" [Medium, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1944621

 15:30 <jawn-smith> It has verbal okay from cjwatson, and just needs sponsoring

 15:31 <vorlon> jawn-smith: ah, 'uploaded' meaning to the bug report?

 15:31 <jawn-smith> yes

 15:31 <vorlon> great, then I'll upload today

 15:31 <dbungert> openssh still will have the snapd test failure with libgcc, so we may want to again hint for that case once the upload occurrs

 15:31 <jawn-smith> thanks!

 15:32 <jawn-smith> vorlon: there's a typo in that patch actually

 15:32 <jawn-smith> s/failues/failures

 15:32 <jawn-smith> I can add another patch to the LP bug unless it's easy for you to fix

 15:32 <vorlon> I can fix it

 15:32 <jawn-smith> thanks! It's just in a comment so won't impact functionality

 15:32 <vorlon> then we also have golang-defaults, blocked by syncthing auotpkgtest regression

 15:32 <slyon> dbungert: I think the tests/smoke/sandbox test of snapd should pass now with snapd 2.53

 15:32 <vorlon> this is new since last week, but has been stuck now for 6 days

 15:32 <slyon> at least it did when tested against systemd

 15:33 <dbungert> slyon: unfortunately not, see the latest test results against glibc

 15:33 <vorlon> syncthing seems it might be regressed in release - should this just be hinted?

 15:33 <jawn-smith> vorlon: I covered the status of syncthing in my status

 15:33 <vorlon> oh, reading up :)

 15:34 <slyon> dbungert: it was a big flaky for me, but yeah that glibc tests shows a slightly different error message, related to libgcc_s.so

 15:34 <vorlon> jawn-smith: ok, if the regression is due to clemente, is it reasonable to hint this?

 15:34 <jawn-smith> It needs a new package added to -universe and a couple of fixes to a dependency called golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go

 15:34 <vorlon> (not to say you can't keep working on fixing the packages)

 15:34 <jawn-smith> That seems fine to me, I will keep working them

 15:35 <dbungert> slyon: I'm curious what makes you say that, it looks like the same issue to me.  What difference do you see?

 15:35 <vorlon> ok I will hint it (it's also in the failure list for glibc, we don't need more entanglement there)

 15:35 <jawn-smith> vorlon: thanks!

 15:35 <vorlon> and that's all the packages that need looking at right now

 15:35 <vorlon> mclemenceau:

 15:35 <mclemenceau> thx

 15:36 <mclemenceau> #topic AOB

 15:36 <slyon> dbungert: this old openssh failure does not contain the "libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work" line: https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/results/autopkgtest-impish/impish/amd64/s/snapd/20210831_011750_8a144@/log.gz

 15:36 <mclemenceau> any other topics that need attention?

 15:36 <slyon> (but that might have been pre-gcc upload?)

 15:38 <dbungert> while I don't understand what's going on in that log, the failure that is happening now for snapd is expected to me

 15:38 <mclemenceau> alright then I think we're done, thanks everyone

 15:39 <mclemenceau> #endmeeting
