 14:32 <cpaelzer> all false-positives of known

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I nidged the rest of security last week, now it is your turn sarnold

 14:32 <sarnold> python-oslo.limit?

 14:32 <cpaelzer> fence-agents ETA ?

 14:33 <sarnold> unknown :/ I haven't gotten around to starting it yet, and this week I'm on the cve triage rotation, which is also a mind-eating (and time-eating) task

 14:33 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I skipped oslo as it is in the later new report

 14:33 <sarnold> aha

 14:33 <cpaelzer> are you the only poor guy doing these reviews or can we try to bribe someone else in addition? :-)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> no - really as lon as we'll be in time for the release we don't mind if it is this or next week

 14:34 <doko> the ADSys MIR is still on my list

 14:34 <cpaelzer> but Impish release is coming closer

 14:34 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I'm pretty much it, we've had enough folks seeking greener pastures..

 14:34 <cpaelzer> hence my pinging on it

 14:34 <cpaelzer> thanks for the info sarnold

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <cpaelzer> here it comes

 14:35 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-oslo.limit/+bug/1940427

 14:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1940427 in python-oslo.limit (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-oslo.limit" [Undecided, New]

 14:35 <cpaelzer> it wasn't lost in mismatches but filed properly

 14:35 <cpaelzer> jamespage: did you plan to do this on yur own since this is openstacky ?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> while waiting on that answer

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:36 <cpaelzer> no new ones

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> back to oslo

 14:36 <cpaelzer> the question is who will do the review

 14:36 <cpaelzer> sarnold: is busy with CVE and then hopefully fence agents :-)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: did the last one

 14:36 <cpaelzer> so I gues sI'll take this one

 14:36 <cpaelzer> jamespage: please ping me if you had other plans for it

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ok, that is all of the usually planned content

 14:37 <cpaelzer> we are not enough to make a vote on the added section

 14:38 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: if you don't mind could you send a paragraph like you'd envision it to be added to the members via mail - that would help

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I'm tempted to say if nothing comes up as discussion on the mail and in two meetings here we can consider then add it even with a minority vote

 14:38 <ddstreet> cpaelzer ah right sorry, i'd forgot about that, i'll make a note to do that

 14:38 <ddstreet> send an email, that is

 14:38 <cpaelzer> np

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok, I'd close it then and try to attend my other meeting that I'd have now ...

 14:39 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:39 <sarnold> a moment..

 14:39 <cpaelzer> busier MIR times ahead after the release I guess

 14:39 <cpaelzer> oh

 14:39 <cpaelzer> step back and grants sarnold the moment

 14:39 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/busybox/+bug/1933979  .. two weeks ago I asked a question on this bug about the consequences of not moving busybox forward, and have received no replies

 14:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1933979 in busybox (Ubuntu) "[MIR] busybox package" [Undecided, New]

 14:39 <cpaelzer> sarnold: the discussion circulated internally

 14:39 <sarnold> any advice / suggestions ..

 14:39 <cpaelzer> sarnold: there is an answer coming

 14:40 <sarnold> okay, cool.

 14:40 <cpaelzer> this isn't blocked anymore

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I'm not 100% how much of the answer can go onto the bug thou

 14:40 <cpaelzer> updated the bug sarnold

 14:41 <cpaelzer> to help free your items a bit

 14:41 <sarnold> cool, thanks :D

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I think I was out the week that you asked

 14:41 <cpaelzer> sorry for that

 14:41 <sarnold> and then I the next :)

 14:41 <cpaelzer> ok, next try

 14:41 <cpaelzer> anything else or are we ok to close for the week

 14:41 <sarnold> that was it for me, thanks

 14:41 <cpaelzer> ok then, thanks everyone
