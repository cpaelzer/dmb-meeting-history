 15:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:30:12 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:30 <cpaelzer> ping ddstreet slyon jamespage sarnold for MIR team meeting

 15:30 <jamespage> o/

 15:30 <cpaelzer> I know didrocks won#t be able to attend but read the backlog later

 15:30 <cpaelzer> doko: is optional these days but still happy to ping him

 15:30 <cpaelzer> let me get this started ...

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:31 <cpaelzer> we had no individual actions, but as you all have seen I have submitted the first draft for rust rules

 15:31 <slyon> o/

 15:31 <cpaelzer> according to feedback by slyon and sarnold I have already modified them

 15:31 <cpaelzer> please have a minute to (re-)review them if you are now ok with them

 15:31 <cpaelzer> didrocks has let me know that he didn't yet, but will have a review as well

 15:32 <cpaelzer> looking back I'm really happy we did the former re-org which made this mcuh more doable

 15:32 <cpaelzer> enough for todays actions then, let us look at mismatches and bugs

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> we had a lot of new cases last time, let us see if it got better

 15:32 <sarnold> goiod morning

 15:33 <cpaelzer> non-proposed looks all good (known cases and known false positives)

 15:33 <slyon> not so much on foundations side. The tasks have been prioritized yesterday. But I think nobody acted on it, yet.

 15:33 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:33 <cpaelzer> slyon: you mean linio-interactive-perl  and libio-prompt-tiny-perl right?

 15:34 <slyon> yes. and dh-elpa + raqm

 15:34 <cpaelzer> correct

 15:34 <cpaelzer> I ahve filed a MIR stub for postgresql-14 but that will be on this page for quite a while as it is a longer transition

 15:34 <cpaelzer> ruby3.0 is being worked on and will get a stub as well

 15:35 <cpaelzer> both are just verison spins, not much to review on those

 15:35 <cpaelzer> more about the formal process

 15:35 <cpaelzer> which leaves pipewire -> wireplumber which IIRC didrocks has taken

 15:35 <cpaelzer> he isn't around so that ping shall be his reminder to sort it out

 15:36 <cpaelzer> anything else that catches your eye in mismatches?

 15:36 <sarnold> I hope someone is on top of the tzdata issue

 15:36 <cpaelzer> right sarnold

 15:37 <cpaelzer> all we had last week about it was you sarnold suggesting that it might be fallout from the upstream tzdata mess

 15:37 <cpaelzer> I'm afraid the list looks long already, but that sounds like another foundation'ish topic slyon

 15:38 <cpaelzer> what do you tihnk?

 15:38 <cpaelzer> think

 15:39 <slyon> tzdata is a foundations package.. so probably yes, that's foundations too

 15:39 <slyon> I'll put that on the list

 15:39 <cpaelzer> hmm

 15:39 <cpaelzer> the source of this might be openstack though

 15:40 <cpaelzer> jamespage: does python-croniter mean anything to you?

 15:40 <jamespage> rings a bell

 15:40 <slyon> it is pulled in my an openstack package, indeed

 15:40 <cpaelzer> yep per http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html

 15:41 <cpaelzer> jamespage: in that case given that slyon has already taken four cases would you be able to look after python-croniter -> python-tzdata

 15:41 <jamespage> several make use of it

 15:41 <jamespage> sure

 15:41 <cpaelzer> if it is really only tzdata it might be a trivial case

 15:41 <cpaelzer> oh is that one of the multi-deps and you just happen to be the one listed first

 15:44 <cpaelzer> none of the others sounds like main though https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/xRt32v7F3X/

 15:44 <sarnold> argh, apparently I misread. tzlocal != tzdata :) heh

 15:44 <cpaelzer> sarnold: it still might be related :-)

 15:44 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage for having a look, let us know next week how it shall be handled

 15:44 <sarnold> perhaps, it's just not what I thought it was :) I do still hope someone is on top of the tzdata mess but it's a lot less relevant at the moment than I expected :)

 15:44 <cpaelzer> going on ...

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:45 <slyon> no update on egl-wayland..

 15:45 <cpaelzer> yep :-/

 15:45 <cpaelzer> I'mmarking it incomplete with a comment

 15:46 <cpaelzer> no others

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:46 <cpaelzer> vulkan-tools and postgresql-14 is being worked on - but none is ready yet

 15:46 <cpaelzer> egl-wayland we just had

 15:47 <cpaelzer> opensc and other smartcard work also happens, but isn't ready yet

 15:47 <cpaelzer> mostly on sarnold and team if they find resources

 15:47 <cpaelzer> all other incomplete bugs are even older

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:48 * didrocks back

 15:48 <didrocks> on wireplumber, I should have created the empty MIR bug report and assign to seb128

 15:48 <cpaelzer> as an FYI vorlon resolved the remaining open task on swtpm - this is now all eyes on security review :-/

 15:48 <cpaelzer> didrocks: no plumber MIR bug reported

 15:48 <sarnold> woot

 15:48 <cpaelzer> didrocks: unless you created it just now

 15:48 <didrocks> no, that was last week

 15:48 <didrocks> probably because the link don’t add the tag by default

 15:48 <cpaelzer> didrocks: hmm, then it fails to be detected

 15:49 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wireplumber/+bug/1949776

 15:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1949776 in wireplumber (Ubuntu) "[MIR] wireplumber" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 15:49 <cpaelzer> MIR team needs to be susbcribed for detection

 15:49 <didrocks> ack, done

 15:49 <sarnold> at the moment that's probably fine :) just needs to happen when it's time for progress :)

 15:50 <didrocks> yeah, but we want to show it’s handled and not pending on us in c-m

 15:50 <cpaelzer> ok will be good next week then

 15:50 <cpaelzer> ok I think that was it for today

 15:50 <cpaelzer> anything else ?

 15:50 <sarnold> nothing from me

 15:50 <didrocks> nothing either

 15:50 <slyon> nothing here

 15:51 <cpaelzer> ok for this week then

 15:51 * cpaelzer is dreaming of an awesome 22.04 ...

 15:51 <cpaelzer> see you all next week

 15:51 <sarnold> \o/

 15:51 <slyon> o/ thank you all!

 15:51 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 15:51 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
