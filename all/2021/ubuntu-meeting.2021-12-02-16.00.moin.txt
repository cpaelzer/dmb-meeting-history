 16:10 <sil2100> Welcome indeed o/

 16:11 <bdmurray> Any questions on status?

 16:11 <bdmurray> juliank: what happened with rabbitmq dying?

 16:12 <juliank> it ran out of memory

 16:12 <juliank> then it blocked publishers

 16:12 <bdmurray> Is juju using a lot of memory? IS mentioned something about that to me recently.

 16:12 <juliank> hoping things would get consumed and release resources

 16:12 <juliank> it's not a juju issue, the rabbitmq is limited to 40% of ram

 16:12 <juliank> and then it blocks publishers

 16:13 <bdmurray> okay

 16:13 <juliank> we don't know why it runs out of memory, it only had like 100 tests or so

 16:13 * juliank forgot to take a status dump before restarting

 16:14 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:14 <bdmurray> bug 1943530

 16:14 <ubottu> Bug 1943530 in krb5 (Ubuntu) "link libkrb5 with openssl" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1943530

 16:15 <bdmurray> Given the comments we should probably take this

 16:16 <juliank> +1

 16:16 <juliank> next step figure out licensing of reverse deps of the lib?

 16:16 <juliank> there might be openssl incompatible licensed rdeps

 16:16 <bdmurray> bug 1951399

 16:16 <ubottu> Bug 1951399 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Jammy) "Ubuntu, Budgie, Kubuntu, Kylin, MATE, Xubuntu: jammy daily fails to install" [Undecided, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1951399

 16:16 <bdmurray> This should be fixed with Robie's upload

 16:16 <sil2100> \o/

 16:17 <schopin> juliank: it's becoming less likely though with th eOpenSSL license change

 16:17 <juliank> basically GPL-2

 16:17 <juliank> bdmurray: right-ish

 16:17 <juliank> bdmurray: needs fixing for 22.10

 16:17 <juliank> in ubiquity to avoid using deprecated stuff

 16:17 <bdmurray> I'd rather have a new bug than this mess of metoo comments

 16:18 <vorlon> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2021-October/002587.html has bearing wrt license questions

 16:18 <bdmurray> anyway there is no action here

 16:18 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ii-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:18 <bdmurray> bug 1944086

 16:19 <vorlon> juliank: ^^ basically, I am questioning FSF's blanket assertion that Apache license is incompatible with GPL2

 16:19 <bdmurray> I found a fair number of duplicates of this the other day

 16:19 <juliank> yes

 16:20 <bdmurray> Before taking it though let's check the error tracker for the same crash

 16:20 <bdmurray> I'll do that and update the bug

 16:20 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:20 <bdmurray> bug 1948884 still needs investigation before carding

 16:20 <ubottu> Bug 1948884 in casper (Ubuntu) "casper interactive_netmount looks for the wrong url on 20.04.3" [Low, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1948884

 16:21 <sil2100> I investigated it!

 16:21 <bdmurray> woot

 16:21 <bdmurray> so it needs fixing in jammy too then?

 16:21 <sil2100> And well, I don't know if this was anything that we said would be working

 16:21 <juliank> vorlon: on the other end of the spectrum, I believe apache licensed code can be incompatible with gpl-3 if it contains weird stuff in NOTICE

 16:21 <juliank> :D

 16:21 <sil2100> Yeah, so how it's written right now it will only work before any point-release is released

 16:22 <bdmurray> right

 16:22 <sil2100> I guess we can figure out something to make it better for 22.04 for sure

 16:22 <sil2100> But you know, it was broken with .1, .2 and .3 and only now someone noticed! SO I don't think it's too high priority

 16:22 <bdmurray> What's the actual use case here?

 16:22 <sil2100> Let's card it but put somewhere lower in the backlog IMO

 16:24 <bdmurray> Given how long its been broken let's not bother carding it.

 16:26 <vorlon> python-crypto: previously discussed, no action here, the package should eventually go away

 16:26 <vorlon> dbus-python: just blocked by pyqt5 now, we can ignore this for the time being

 16:26 <vorlon> libcgi-pm-perl: xypron: are you still working on this?

 16:26 <slyon> i resolved python-dbus down to numpy last week. seems to be stuck on pyopencl FTBFS now

 16:26 <xypron> vorlon: not actively this week

 16:27 <vorlon> xypron: ok; are you going to have time in the next week?

 16:27 <xypron> No I am in SF for the RISC-V conference

 16:27 <vorlon> for (relatively) new folks, note the expectation is that when taking one of these packages, it should be resolved by the next weekly meeting

 16:27 <vorlon> xypron: aha!

 16:27 <vorlon> can someone else look at libcgi-pm-perl this week?

 16:27 <ginggs> i can

 16:28 <vorlon> ginggs: thanks

 16:28 <ginggs> it may just need retries, we resolved a dependency cycle last week

 16:28 <vorlon> libidn: I looked at it on +1 maintenance, but that shift is over so needs a new point person

 16:29 <vorlon> waveform: could you?

 16:29 <schopin> this is blocked by ghostscript

 16:29 <waveform> vorlon, ack

 16:29 <vorlon> thanks

 16:29 <schopin> ginggs: didn't you mention a patch on -devel for it a few days ago?

 16:29 <vorlon> libregexp-pattern-license-perl: juliank: is this still you?

 16:29 <ginggs> schopin: ghostscript?

 16:29 <schopin> yes

 16:29 <juliank> vorlon: I think so, I think we are down to an infra hickup and MIR for licensecheck dep

 16:29 <vorlon> juliank: ok

 16:30 <vorlon> python-click is still mwhudson who's not here to refuse

 16:30 <ginggs> schopin: yes, i filed LP: #1953018 earlier, so that info didn't get lost

 16:30 <vorlon> dbungert: are you still on node-jquery?

 16:30 <juliank> ugh licensecheck/amd64 in main cannot depend on libio-interactive-perl in universe

 16:30 <dbungert> vorlon: yes, one more regression left on node-jquery

 16:31 <vorlon> schopin: gobject-introspection, is this still with you?

 16:31 <slyon> juliank: there is a pending MIR for that: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libio-interactive-perl/+bug/1951067

 16:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1951067 in libio-interactive-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libio-interactive-perl" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 16:31 <schopin> hmm, I marked it as done on my todolist... sorry, I'll have another look then.

 16:32 <juliank> schopin: hmm you did not fill it out :D

 16:32 <vorlon> schopin: ok. hasn't migrated, waiting on related packages - may need deeper poking

 16:32 <vorlon> doko: can you take liburi-perl?

 16:32 <slyon> juliank: indeed :) It needs to be filled by somebody

 16:32 <doko> ok, and looking at the python-crypto removal

 16:32 <juliank> sorry for the tab completion typo above

 16:33 <vorlon> doko: python-crypto removal consists of a lot of pestering of the openstack team :)

 16:33 <vorlon> so you can probably parallelize

 16:33 <doko> I'm good with pestering ;p

 16:33 <sil2100> ;)

 16:33 <vorlon> pam, this one has been looked at before, weird behavior regarding proxy env vars; I'll take it

 16:34 <vorlon> libwww-perl: ogayot: could you take this one?

 16:34 <ogayot> sure

 16:34 <vorlon> iso-codes: bdmurray?

 16:35 <bdmurray> okay

 16:35 <vorlon> gpgme1.0: sil2100?

 16:35 <ginggs> i've down for a gpgme1.0 merge

 16:35 <vorlon> oh actually I guess that's about python3-defaults not about gpgme1.0 anyway

 16:35 <ginggs> yeah

 16:35 <vorlon> ginggs: are you on top of python3-defaults then?

 16:35 <sil2100> ...win

 16:36 <ginggs> vorlon: i'm still hacking at it, if that's what you mean

 16:37 <vorlon> ok

 16:37 <bdmurray> he might be underneath it then

 16:37 <jawn-smith> I will also be in San Fran next week but I can take one to work over the next couple of days

 16:37 <vorlon> who doesn't have anything yet?

 16:38 <jawn-smith> o/

 16:38 <slyon> o/

 16:38 <vorlon> jawn-smith: libcommon-sense-perl, then?

 16:38 <vorlon> slyon: cmake?

 16:38 <slyon> vorlon: ok

 16:38 <jawn-smith> vorlon: ack

 16:38 <sil2100> Yesss, jawn-smith can now use his new powers, mu ha ha

 16:38 <vorlon> and then let's stop there

 16:38 <vorlon> openssl is also high priority, I'm poking at getting it unblocked this week

 16:38 <vorlon> fyi

 16:39 <slyon> I'll be working on systemd a bit once the first tests are finished

 16:39 <vorlon> (terminal open right now patching burp, thanks to guidance from schopin)

 16:39 <vorlon> bdmurray:

 16:39 <sil2100> vorlon: thanks!

 16:39 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:40 <bdmurray> anything else?

 16:40 <jawn-smith> As previously mentioned, xypron and I will be out of office next week for the RISC-V summit

 16:40 <jawn-smith> I will return to work Friday

 16:41 <bdmurray> Be safe!

 16:41 <jawn-smith> just got boosted :)

 16:43 <bdmurray> okay, thanks everboyd

 16:43 <bdmurray> yes, big thanks to boyd

 16:43 <bdmurray> #endmeeting
