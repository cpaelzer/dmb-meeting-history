 20:15 <sil2100> Anyway, sorry for being late

 20:15 <vorlon> right, that ;)

 20:16 <sil2100> Whoops!

 20:16 <sil2100> I knew I uh, forgot something :(

 20:16 <mdeslaur> sil2100: do you have any progress on your action items, or are they carry-over

 20:16 <sil2100> Sadly, carry-over - but the last one can be considered done I suppose

 20:16 <sil2100> Since I updated the processes

 20:17 <mdeslaur> this one? ACTION: sil2100 to discuss with release team where to document decisions about LTS status of flavors (prior to release notes creation late in cycle)

 20:17 <mdeslaur> oh, good

 20:17 <mdeslaur> thanks, I'll remove it
