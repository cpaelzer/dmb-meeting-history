 22:05 <diddledan> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 22:05 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Jan  7 22:05:47 2021 UTC.  The chair is diddledan. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:06 <diddledan> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for <DATE>. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:06 <diddledan> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:06 <diddledan> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:06 <diddledan> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:06 <diddledan> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:06 <diddledan> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the majority of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:06 <diddledan> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:06 <diddledan> #topic Mark Johnson

 22:07 <marxjohnson> Hello, do I go now?

 22:07 <diddledan> Hi Mark, could you please introduce yourself and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad profile?

 22:07 * diddledan was typing :-p

 22:07 <bashfulrobot> please do.

 22:07 <marxjohnson> Hi everyone, here's my wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkJohnson and launchpad https://launchpad.net/~mark-barrenfrozenwasteland

 22:10 <marxjohnson> I've been part of the Ubuntu community for a long time, and have been contributing to the community as co-presenter of the Ubuntu Podcast for about a decade. With the recent resurgence of activity around the ubuntu community boards, I decided it was about time that I become a member, in the hope that I can become more actively involved in the community beyond the podcast in the future.

 22:12 <diddledan> you've got some great testimonials, and more than a few of them to boot :-) When everyone is ready the floor is open for any questions the board members have

 22:12 <Wild_Man> marxjohnson, that you anticipated the question we were going to ask, and that's if you have plans to spread out beyond the podcast and what that mighty look like

 22:12 <bashfulrobot> marxjohnson:  Do you see yourself expanding in any other ways outside the podcast?

 22:13 <Bashing-om> marxjohnson: With 10+ years of sustained service - recognition is long overdue :) In your future how do you perceive that this board can further your goals ?

 22:15 <diddledan> I wasn't aware that you were involved in organising oggcamp :-D that's awesome. Will you be returning to that when the plague is subsided to get in-person eventing back on the agenda?

 22:15 <marxjohnson> I'm interested in paying more attention to the members and activity of the community council and membership boards, using my votes in those areas effectively, and hopefully using my experience of the ubuntu community and the process of becoming member to contribute useful ideas.

 22:16 <marxjohnson> Also knowing who's who and what's happening makes for good content on the show :)

 22:17 <marxjohnson> I don't think I have the capacity to be the lead organiser of another OggCamp these days (recently became a dad), but if there are more events in the future I'd certainly help out where I can

 22:17 <diddledan> awesome. and congratulations of fatherhood!

 22:17 <marxjohnson> Thanks :)

 22:17 <marxjohnson> I think that covers the questions that have been asked so far?

 22:17 <diddledan> any more questions before we get to the vote?

 22:17 <Bashing-om> marxjohnson: Commendable attitude - these things are what we look for :D

 22:18 <bashfulrobot> I honestly already had my vote ready in my head. ;-p

 22:18 <diddledan> sneaky, bashfulrobot ;-p

 22:18 <diddledan> ok, let's get on with it then..
