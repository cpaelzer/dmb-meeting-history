 15:03 <jawn-smith> * This is a break from how it is implemented in the python version, and will

 15:03 <jawn-smith> break some backwards compatibility. It is important for adding

 15:03 <jawn-smith> other image types in the future.

 15:17 <juliank> Don't want to enable Apple upgrades before the weekend :D

 15:17 <bdmurray> juliank: okay

 15:20 <bdmurray> Let's go ahead and take that. Is that already a card for it?

 15:20 <slyon> I created that bug. IBM usually asks about the new s390-tools

 15:20 <slyon> it could be a nice task for one of our new starters

 15:20 <slyon> no card yet AFAIK

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1933826

 15:21 <ubottu> Bug 1933826 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "default file permissions on bootloader configuration" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1933826

 15:21 <juliank> not sure why we patched it to be 444, but sounds sensible to drop the patch

 15:21 <juliank> :D

 15:21 <bdmurray> juliank you've looked at this right?

 15:21 <juliank> we should card it

 15:21 <bdmurray> okay, will do

 15:23 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-hh-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:23 <bdmurray> nothing here

 15:23 <bdmurray> bug 1934221

 15:23 <ubottu> Bug 1934221 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd-resolve segfault" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1934221

 15:23 <slyon> there is a patch to this bug, I think we should take it

 15:24 <bdmurray> do you know if it is fixed in impish or some later release?

 15:24 <bdmurray> where later is later than focal

 15:24 <slyon> it seems to be a backport from systemd v248 â€“ so should be in impish

 15:25 <bdmurray> cool, I'll target and card it after the meeting

 15:25 <slyon> thanks!

 15:25 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:26 <bdmurray> vorlon:

 15:26 <vorlon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:26 <vorlon> pretty short list overall right now

 15:26 <vorlon> there's glibc that's in progress and has been looked at by multiple folks (breezy is the only package currently blocking)

 15:27 <vorlon> sounds like doko has been looking at it recently, I'm not going to ask for another assignee on this

 15:27 <vorlon> and then most of the rest of the packages on the list are blocked by openldap, which is a server team migration

 15:27 <vorlon> and then we have a systemd/amd64 autopkgtest failure blocking linux-meta-aws

 15:27 <vorlon> any volunteers to look into that?

 15:28 <slyon> I guess that is on me

 15:28 <vorlon> systemd/linux-aws-meta: slyon

 15:28 <vorlon> thanks

 15:29 <vorlon> and that's all

 15:31 <juliank> I'm getting my vaccine tomorrow afternoon - 3h before - until EOD
