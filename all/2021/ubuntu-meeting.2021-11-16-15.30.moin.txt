 15:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:30:25 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:30 <cpaelzer> Hi didrocks ddstreet slyon jamespage sarnold

 15:30 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:31 <slyon> o/

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <cpaelzer> the first is to thank ddstreet for all of his work as he will resign from the MIR team

 15:31 <cpaelzer> everyone please thank him as well :-)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> but at the same time a reminder for ddstreet to suggest us a SEG successor :-)

 15:32 <slyon> thank you for the work you put into this!

 15:32 <cpaelzer> Next action is about a request that we should announce the change to our templates

 15:32 <sarnold> thank you ddstreet :)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> that came in from desktop seb128 / didrocks - and I agree

 15:32 <cpaelzer> the most important reason is if people have own templates "derived" fromt he old content

 15:33 <cpaelzer> I planned to send a mail to ubuntu-devel but wanted to bring it up here if there would be any "oh now please ..." arguments to be had?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> just say yes/ok if you are ok that I send such an FYI mail

 15:34 <sarnold> for my part the email sounds good, but I don't often work directly with the template

 15:34 <slyon> I'm OK with sending a FYI email. people should adopt to the new template, if they use any. our template is the official source

 15:34 <cpaelzer> it is meant to help, no one is "forced" to use it

 15:35 <cpaelzer> but since it helps a lot to have the initial report be of better quality it is at least "recommended" IMHO

 15:35 <cpaelzer> ok then

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #action cpaelzer to send a mail about the new templates to ubuntu-devel

 15:35 * meetingology cpaelzer to send a mail about the new templates to ubuntu-devel

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:36 <cpaelzer> I've seen slyon, myeslf and a few others create proper MIR bugs for many of the former open cases

 15:36 <cpaelzer> thank you all (except myself) for doing so

 15:36 <cpaelzer> AFAICS we have two new cases today

 15:36 <cpaelzer> 1. pyhon-cliff->python-autopage

 15:36 <slyon> thank you cpaelzer, too ;-) Yeah I've created template, but they still need to be filled

 15:37 <cpaelzer> well, all we need right now is knowing they are owned by someone

 15:37 <cpaelzer> that we have now

 15:37 <cpaelzer> cliff is openstack jamespage

 15:37 <jamespage> got it

 15:37 <cpaelzer> by our usual rule of thumb that would mean it would be great if jamespage could look after python-autopage

 15:37 <cpaelzer> great, thanks jamespage

 15:38 <cpaelzer> and another one I think

 15:38 <cpaelzer> flask -> python-dotenv & pytohn-asgiref

 15:38 <cpaelzer> also openstack

 15:38 <cpaelzer> jamespage: thee in one go?

 15:38 <cpaelzer> three

 15:38 <jamespage> go on them

 15:38 <jamespage> the last one I looked at was a false positive so fingers crossed :)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> ok, as with the others if we'd have at least bug-stubs until next week that reflect the team that will tackle them - that would be great

 15:39 <cpaelzer> even if you do not find the time to fully process them the stubs will help

 15:39 <jamespage> I'll do tht today

 15:39 <cpaelzer> awesome

 15:39 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:39 <cpaelzer> a bunch of the new ones needs to go to incomplete

 15:40 <cpaelzer> let me do that ...

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:40 <cpaelzer> three left to review

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ALL of them are version bumps

 15:41 <cpaelzer> oh no

 15:41 <cpaelzer> ruby 3.0 and postgresql-14 are version bumps

 15:41 <cpaelzer> same source as before, I can handle ruby

 15:41 <cpaelzer> assigned to me

 15:42 <cpaelzer> Wireguard is a new promotion, it needs a real review and then surecly security

 15:42 <cpaelzer> anyone open to review that one?

 15:42 <slyon> I can do wireguard

 15:42 <cpaelzer> thank you, assigning

 15:43 <cpaelzer> Finally postgresql-14, as I said it is a version bump that usually is fine (no long review, just a sanity check)

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I'd do it, but it is my package and bug - so that seems wrong

 15:43 <cpaelzer> anyone available to do that quick check?

 15:43 <cpaelzer> didrocks: ?

 15:43 <cpaelzer> being the only one without a todo today so far :-)

 15:43 <cpaelzer> but also not speaking up, maybe he's not around :-/

 15:44 <slyon> If nobody else wants to go, I can do that too

 15:44 <slyon> should be quick

 15:44 <cpaelzer> thank you, it really should be a formality

 15:44 <cpaelzer> which you see in the bug content saying

 15:44 <cpaelzer> Conceptually this is the same as

 15:44 <cpaelzer> - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postgresql-13/+bug/1902059

 15:44 <cpaelzer> - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postgresql-12/+bug/1851396

 15:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1902059 in postgresql-13 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] postgresql-13" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 15:45 <cpaelzer> :-)

 15:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1851396 in postgresql-12 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] postgresql-12" [High, Fix Released]

 15:45 <cpaelzer> That would be all new ones

 15:45 <slyon> thanks for those pointers!

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:45 <cpaelzer> we see those I set to incomplete 10 minutes ago

 15:45 <cpaelzer> and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wireplumber/+bug/1949776

 15:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1949776 in wireplumber (Ubuntu) "[MIR] wireplumber" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 15:45 <cpaelzer> That was reviewed by didrocks

 15:46 <cpaelzer> seems like "mostly ok, except X" and waiting in incomplete on X

 15:46 <cpaelzer> no action needed from us atm

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:46 <cpaelzer> I handled mine in the actions section

 15:46 <cpaelzer> anything else from anyone?

 15:46 <sarnold> nothing from me

 15:46 <slyon> nope

 15:47 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: is as inactive as annoucnecd and didrocks seems busy - jamespage anything else from you?

 15:48 <cpaelzer> ok I just got a ping by didrocks he really is unavailable, but absolutely excused for today

 15:48 <cpaelzer> timeout on "other business" for jamespage :-)

 15:48 <cpaelzer> that concludes our meeting today

 15:48 <cpaelzer> thank you all!

 15:49 <slyon> thank you cpaelzer, all!

 15:49 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, ddstreet, all :)

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
