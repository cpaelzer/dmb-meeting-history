 15:27 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:27 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:27:26 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:27 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:27 <cpaelzer> I started this early, but no panic we all have time to show up :-)

 15:31 <didrocks> hey :)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> didrocks ddstreet sarnold jamespage hiho

 15:31 <cpaelzer> this might be one of the fastest meetings we have anyway (from my pre-checks)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> so no need to wait for everyone

 15:31 <cpaelzer> :-)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> no previous action items to check

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> which is a) so small it fit on one screen (awesome cleanup everyone)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> and b) has no new entries that are worth to discuss

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:33 <cpaelzer> which is only octavia that is discussed between jamespage and security

 15:33 <cpaelzer> Only the set back to new is odd

 15:33 <cpaelzer> jamespage: if you think with your explanations it should go back to re-review by them assign them

 15:34 <cpaelzer> I'll mark it incomplete for now as it does not seem to need a new MIR review

 15:34 <cpaelzer> done

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:34 <cpaelzer> nothing very recent

 15:35 <cpaelzer> ayatana is ok and no action needed from our POV

 15:35 <cpaelzer> and that as promised for a quick meeting brings me to

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:35 <didrocks> nothing for me

 15:35 <cpaelzer> didrocks: you are the only one that showed up (probably due to this beeing the weeks with the TZ-mismatch)

 15:35 <cpaelzer> ok nothing for me either

 15:35 <sarnold> good morning

 15:35 <cpaelzer> ah here is one :-)

 15:36 <cpaelzer> anything to add sarnold?

 15:36 <didrocks> yeah, itâ€™s the usual period of a couple of weird weeks in term of TZ :p

 15:36 <sarnold> nothing for me

 15:36 <cpaelzer> ok, then that was quick and easy

 15:36 <cpaelzer> thanks!

 15:36 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
