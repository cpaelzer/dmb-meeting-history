 20:05 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 20:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:05 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:05:23 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:05 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:05 <bashfulrobot> hey galgalesh - welcome!

 20:06 <galgalesh> o/

 20:06 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:06 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:06 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:06 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:06 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:07 <Wild_Man> You've signed the code of conduct. Did you understand everything it said and do you agree to abide by the spirit of the code of conduct?

 20:07 <galgalesh> yes

 20:07 <Wild_Man> #topic galgalesh

 20:08 * diddledani pokenprod the bot

 20:08 <Wild_Man> galgalesh , please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:08 * fenris pong the bot

 20:08 <Wild_Man> It's a sleep

 20:08 <diddledani> wiki/forum post

 20:09 <Wild_Man> Yes thanks diddledani

 20:09 <diddledani> we're still getting used to having applications via the forum :-)

 20:09 <galgalesh> Hi all! My name is Merlijn Sebrechts. I'm a contributor from Belgium. Today I'm mostly active in the snapcraft community, being a core member of snapcrafters and maintaining a bunch of desktop snaps. I used to be active in the Yaru project and the charms.reactive project.

 20:09 <galgalesh> This is my discourse post: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/merlijn-membership-application/24005

 20:10 <Kilos> i quite fancy the discourse thing

 20:10 <diddledani> thanks, galgalesh , and hi :-)

 20:10 <galgalesh> =D

 20:11 <Wild_Man> Thanks galgalesh, please give us a few minutes to review

 20:11 <diddledani> so, now you're a cyborg, are you more, or less, concerned about skynet? ;-p

 20:12 <fenris> previous applicant writing on their wiki .. but our cyborg here write his stories on discourse :) .. fancied

 20:12 <galgalesh> Oof, good question! I think I'm more concerned now that I've given part of my essential primary functions are done using technology.

 20:12 <fenris> maybe @galgalesh can continue to be snapcrafter cyborg

 20:13 <fenris> or charmer cyborg

 20:13 <bashfulrobot> I can't lie, I started the Krita snap wayyyyyyy back in the day before others took it over, so if galgalesh is the maintainer now, it's almost an instant vote for me. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: That thing was a pain back then.....

 20:13 <bashfulrobot> But to be serious, it looks like you have a really strong application. It is interesting to see how you have moved between different components of the Canonical ecosystem (snaps, juju, yaru, etc) . It's great to see someone staying in the ecosystem, even if interests have changed.

 20:13 <diddledani> I love that you've got a varied portfolio of contributions. Are you likely to go back to juju or charms, or are you mostly focusing on snapcraft (like me)?

 20:13 <bashfulrobot> this! üëÜ

 20:14 <galgalesh> I'm mostly staying in snapcraft. My contributions to charms was mostly professionally oriented, but that focus has shifted to Kubernetes. Now we just use charms to kickstart k8s. :)

 20:15 <fenris> sorry to ask, how many krita got on snap .. i can only see 1 .. but its published by krita

 20:15 <diddledani> that makes sense :-)

 20:15 <bashfulrobot> I'm just getting started there myself professionally

 20:15 <fenris> maybe someone can enlighten me

 20:15 <Wild_Man> galgalesh, do you have plans to broaden your contributions in the community to include helping answer questions in your free time?

 20:15 <galgalesh> Yes, I'm a contributor to the snap published by Krita.

 20:15 <bashfulrobot> Well it is likely that Krita was started in the snapcrafter org, then moved successfully into the Krita org.

 20:16 <bashfulrobot> That

 20:16 <fenris> +1 to @bashfulrobot for @galgalesh contribution to snaps, juju, yaru and etc

 20:16 <diddledani> not yet, fenris ;-p

 20:16 <bashfulrobot> is usually the goal of a snap being  started in snapcrafters, help them build, and hopefully they take over.

 20:16 <fenris> diddledani: not voting .. just to 2nd what @bashfulrobot said earlier

 20:16 <fenris> :)

 20:17 * diddledani whistles nonchalantly

 20:17 <fenris> @bashfulrobot duly noted

 20:17 * bashfulrobot sees what you did there

 20:18 <galgalesh> Wild_Man interesting question! I'm happy to teach others, although I'm not sure what the best format is. I used to be active on AskUbuntu but I stopped after some unpleasant experiences with other community members there.

 20:18 <diddledani> you've got a hefty score on AskUbuntu!

 20:18 <bashfulrobot> galgalesh: with you planned improvements to desktop snaps, is the idea to be QT focused, or more in general (other toolkits, and the desktop in general)

 20:18 <bashfulrobot> diddledani: you beat me to clicking the link

 20:18 <bashfulrobot> heh

 20:18 <Wild_Man> galgalesh, I understand I have not had the time to help on Ask Ubuntu in a long time now

 20:19 <Wild_Man> I did review your contributions there yesterday

 20:20 <galgalesh> I would really like to improve the QT situation specifically, since that still has some pain points. I also would really like to get a better toolkit for snapping 32-bit and gtk-2 apps. Next to that, I'm maintaining and improving sommelier-core to make it easier to snap Windows applications. Might be a bit controversial though ;)

 20:21 <diddledani> sommelier is awesome

 20:21 <bashfulrobot> no judgement here. right tool/right job

 20:21 <bashfulrobot> üëç

 20:21 <Wild_Man> You have your hands full

 20:21 <Wild_Man> Ready to vote?

 20:21 <galgalesh> My ambitions are always bigger than my available time '=D

 20:21 <diddledani> apart from myself, galgalesh seems to be the most active person in the Snapcrafters

 20:22 * bashfulrobot kicks the dirt in shame

 20:22 <Wild_Man> Mine to galgalesh
