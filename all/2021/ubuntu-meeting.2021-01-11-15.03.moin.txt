 15:08 <rafaeldtinoco> paride: hello

 15:09 <rafaeldtinoco> paride: would you mind introducing yourself to the group ?

 15:09 <paride> hello Rafael! sure.

 15:10 <teward> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ParideLegovini/UbuntuServerDeveloperApplication

 15:10 <paride> I'm Paride Legovini, longtime Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) user located in Italy. I'm currently part of the Ubuntu Server team where I work as the QA engineer.

 15:10 <teward> #chair teward

 15:10 <meetingology> Current chairs: rafaeldtinoco teward

 15:10 <paride> My application page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ParideLegovini/UbuntuServerDeveloperApplication LP page: https://launchpad.net/~paride

 15:10 <teward> (sorry bout that rafaeldtinoco just wanted to assist :P )

 15:11 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: no reason to be sorry for

 15:11 <rafaeldtinoco> alright, let's have some minutes for members to read your application (if not already) and ask you some questions

 15:12 <paride> I've been involved with FLOSS development for several years now and began working with the Server Team in 2019. As part of my QA role I perform several different tasks, mostly maintaining automation of stuff, general quality checking, ISO testing and so on

 15:12 <paride> I also participate in the triage process, bugfix work and merging of packages from Debian

 15:13 <paride> I've also been involved in the Ubuntu Release process starting from 19.04, participating to the release "sprints" in person and lately remotely

 15:14 <paride> My background before starting to work as Ubuntu fulltime is mostly in the academia (I studies physics and then geophysics), where I performed mostly IT related work for research groups

 15:15 <paride> I am Debian Developer, which came handy from time to time for my Ubuntu work, and now I'm looking forward formally joining Ubuntu too :)

 15:15 <rafaeldtinoco> thanks paride

 15:15 <rbasak> I'm a colleague of Paride's, so I intend to step back and let others drive the interview.

 15:15 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: tku. I'm in the same situation, so I'll open for questions of other DMB members

 15:16 <rafaeldtinoco> sil2100: teward: ddstreet: go ahead whenever you're ready.

 15:18 <teward> my attention on this is only 50% at the moment - active netsec issues @ workplace

 15:18 <teward> but i have no questions at this time

 15:18 <teward> sil2100: ddstreet: floor's yours

 15:18 <ddstreet> paride most of your (listed) work so far has been on the devel release, have you done much sru work?

 15:19 <sil2100> No questions here o/

 15:20 <paride> ddstreet, I didn't do SRU uploads myself, however I've been involved in the cloud-init SRU process for the past few uploads, collecting test results to fill in cloud-init SRU bugs

 15:22 <ddstreet> thanks, no more q from me

 15:22 <paride> In general I did participate to sru *processes*, but without driving the process itself. Also as part of my triage process I did gave feedback on the possibility of SRUing a fix for the bug

 15:22 <rafaeldtinoco> ddstreet: thank you

 15:22 <rafaeldtinoco> are we ready to vote ?

 15:23 <ddstreet> i'm ready

 15:23 <rafaeldtinoco> #vote paride, Ubuntu Server Developer pkgset application

 15:25 <meetingology> +1 received from teward

 15:25 <sil2100> +1 good endorsements + I have worked with Paride during release weeks for both devel and stable series and I was always happy with his work, so I'm confident that he'll do good with upload rights as well

 15:26 <rbasak> Of everyone here, that's all the non-colleague DMB members voted I think?

 15:26 <rafaeldtinoco> +1 (after all other votes). I would recommend more merges to paride so he can apply to coredev in a medium future

 15:26 <meetingology> +1 (after all other votes). I would recommend more merges to paride so he can apply to coredev in a medium future received from rafaeldtinoco

 15:26 <rbasak> So since they're all unanimous, I'll also provide a +1 to make quorum

 15:26 <rbasak> +1

 15:28 * meetingology rafaeldtinoco to add paride to serverdev and announce

 15:28 <rafaeldtinoco> ok, we still have another application

 15:28 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: ping

 15:28 <Eickmeyer> o/

 15:28 * Eickmeyer here, sleepy as it's early morning

 15:28 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: could you introduce your self to the crew ?

 15:28 <rafaeldtinoco> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Eickmeyer/MOTUApplication

 15:29 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: Sure.

 15:30 <Eickmeyer> Hi everyone. I'm Erich Eickmeyer, leader of the Ubuntu Studio flavor, also member of the Ubuntu Community Council. I've been working with Ubuntu Studio since 2018 and became a council member in October, and was recently hired by MindShareManagement as their User Experience manager for the Kubuntu Focus line of laptops.

 15:30 <Eickmeyer> My background prior to involvement in Ubuntu was in Audio/Video production and photography as well as customer service.

 15:31 <Eickmeyer> My MOTU application is noted above, and my LP page is https://launchpad.net/~eeickmeyer

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> thank you Eickmeyer !

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> I'll give others some mins so they can read your application.

 15:32 <rafaeldtinoco> DMB, please feel free to drop questions as needed.

 15:33 <teward> I've worked a lot with Erich so i'm going to step back and let the rest of the DMB drive the interview.

 15:33 <teward> (sorry i got a call from the CEO and had to take it - being the IT Security Guy at work is a... well, big thing xD)

 15:34 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: alright, good luck =) stay close

 15:34 <teward> yup

 15:34 <teward> (I'm work from home - i ain't going anywhere xD)

 15:37 <ddstreet> Eickmeyer it seems like most of your uploads are in the devel series, and not much SRU work, is that right?

 15:37 <Eickmeyer> ddstreet: Not completely correct. There are several uploads I've done for SRU work, as sil2100 could probably tell you. :)

 15:38 <Eickmeyer> With my UbuntuStudio packageset, I've even sponsored an SRU or two.

 15:40 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: could you point me out a diff of one of your most challenging uploads ? (one you feel proud about)

 15:40 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: Let me see what I can find.

 15:43 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: Having difficulty, but there's one for rapid-photo-downloader that basically required an interim upload even though the upstream developer, who filed the SRU, wanted the complete next version which had too many new features to qualify for an SRU.

 15:43 <Eickmeyer> So we uploaded an interim version which fixed a crash in the application.

 15:44 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: Here's the diff: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/rapid-photo-downloader_0.9.22-0ubuntu1_0.9.23a1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1.diff.gz

 15:44 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: thank you!

 15:45 <rafaeldtinoco> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rapid-photo-downloader/+bug/1873944

 15:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1873944 in rapid-photo-downloader (Ubuntu Groovy) "[SRU] Upgrade rapid-photo-downloader to version 0.9.23a1" [High,Fix released]

 15:48 <sil2100> Eickmeyer: I see that your appliacation only has one endorsement - is there any reason for that?

 15:48 <Eickmeyer> sil2100: Just lack of people available. I put the word out about two weeks ago.

 15:49 <rafaeldtinoco> EOY is not a good time for endorsements =).. anyway I could add there that I have ran pkgset changes script many times because of Eickmeyer

 15:50 <rafaeldtinoco> he has been adding packages to his seeds very actively lately

 15:51 <ddstreet> Eickmeyer follow up q on that bug, i see it was rejected at first, and then reuploaded and then approved, was there discussion between you and any of the sru members before you reuploaded? i dont see any discussion in the bug comments

 15:52 <Eickmeyer> ddstreet: Myself and bdmurray had some conversations in #ubuntu-release on how to proceed.

 15:52 <ddstreet> ok excellent thanks

 15:54 <Eickmeyer> I'll put this out there since it was only last week: I uploaded a fix to mate-optimus (a dgpu/igpu switching applet for all DEs) that had an incorrect call for KDE Plasma to logout which didn't allow for saving the current session. The fix was very easy.

 15:54 <Eickmeyer> It's in the ubuntustudio packageset since graphics performance is something Studio users can benefit from.

 15:55 <RikMills> sil2100: I would have done a full endorsement, but time was not my friend

 15:56 <sil2100> RikMills: thanks!

 15:56 * sil2100 has no other questions

 15:56 <rbasak> Eickmeyer: have you had a package stuck in proposed before?

 15:57 <Eickmeyer> rbasak: agordejo got stuck recently due to a FTBFS for itself due to a FTBFS for nuitka, which has since resolved with a new version of nuitka. I currently have ubuntustudio-meta stuck due to needing riscv64 builds removed from it, pinged #ubuntu-release to have that resolved, will ping again today.

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> ddstreet: are you good with questions ?

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> i know sil2100 is

 16:00 <ddstreet> yep no more q from me

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> ok

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> no more questions from me either

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: let me know when you're good pls

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> (no rush, take your time)

 16:02 * ddstreet quick coffee refill

 16:02 <teward> ddstreet: bring me some :P

 16:02 * Eickmeyer notes that teward typically drinks coffee by the gallon

 16:02 <teward> Eickmeyer: 10-gallon drum now.

 16:02 <teward> (sorry for ot divergence)

 16:03 <Eickmeyer> Yikes. XD

 16:04 * ddstreet back

 16:04 <rbasak> Eickmeyer: I see many -0ubuntu1 packages in Ubuntu

 16:04 <rbasak> Do you have any plans to integrate with Debian?

 16:05 <rbasak> What's the split between packages you maintain that are only in Ubuntu, and packages that have deltas against Debian?

 16:05 <Eickmeyer> rbasak: Some of that has happened organically (lsp-plugins, for instance, was taken upstream early last year), and I do watch the Debian mulitmedia lists frequently as part of that team.

 16:05 <rbasak> (I'm not saying that these are bad or good, just trying to understand)

 16:06 <Eickmeyer> The packages that have deltas against Debian are typically quick fixes or patches past Feature Freeze. When possible, I try to sync from Debian.

 16:07 <Eickmeyer> For example: for the mate-optimus delta, again, that was a quick fix that I've got an upstream PR in on, which will invalidate that patch I made for the Ubuntu version.

 16:08 <Eickmeyer> And while it's a pre-FF fix, development on mate-optimus is slow.

 16:09 <Eickmeyer> Most likely with Ross Gammon's help, I'll be able to do more with Debian.

 16:10 <rbasak> OK thanks

 16:10 <rbasak> I'm ready to vote

 16:10 <rafaeldtinoco> alright

 16:10 <rafaeldtinoco> thanks rbasak

 16:13 <rbasak> I'm mainly swayed by teward's endorsement, especially as he's your primary sponsor

 16:14 <sil2100> hm

 16:14 <rafaeldtinoco> +1 I know Eickmeyer from his requests and I feel his enthusiasm. My vote is to encourage him to keep pursuing the same with universe packages (specially helping guaranteeing quality in fixes).

 16:15 <rbasak> I would just ask please, Eickmeyer, that you continue to seek review if you're not sure about anything.

 16:15 <Eickmeyer> rbasak: Of course. :)

 16:15 <rbasak> That's partly from teward's endorsement too

 16:15 <rbasak> :)

 16:15 <rafaeldtinoco> yes! totally agree with what rbasak said

 16:15 <sil2100> +1 seeing that you have teward's and RikMills's endorsments, are very responsive whenever reached out to on IRC + your answers to questions, I think you will do fine as a MOTU

 16:15 <meetingology> +1 seeing that you have teward's and RikMills's endorsments, are very responsive whenever reached out to on IRC + your answers to questions, I think you will do fine as a MOTU received from sil2100

 16:15 <Eickmeyer> teward and I have had that discussion. :)

 16:15 <ddstreet> +1 the non-ubuntustudio uploads are a bit light and as teward said there are some small issues in them, but i'm leaning on teward's endorsement indicating that's getting better, and issues appearing to be minor; also I think his enthusiasm and cooperation is excellent, and non-packaging work seems to be good
