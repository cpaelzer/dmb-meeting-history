 12:03 <diddledan> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board 12:00

 12:03 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:03:35 UTC.  The chair is diddledan.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:04 <diddledan> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for January 20th 2021. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:04 <diddledan> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04 <diddledan> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04 <diddledan> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:04 <diddledan> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:04 <diddledan> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the majority of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:04 <diddledan> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:04 <diddledan> #topic Diogo Constantino

 12:05 <diddledan> Hi, DiogoConstantino , could you introduce yourself to the board and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad porofile

 12:05 <DiogoConstantino> This is the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiogoConstantino

 12:05 <DiogoConstantino> This is launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~diogoconstantino

 12:06 <DiogoConstantino> I'm using my own name, not a nickname

 12:07 <DiogoConstantino> I've been a huge fan, user, and I believe a continued and good community contributor for Ubuntu

 12:07 <DiogoConstantino> I've been doing lots of community organizing, mostly in Portugal

 12:08 <DiogoConstantino> also contributing to building bridges between European LoCo teams

 12:08 <Kilos> DiogoConstantino why did you take so long to apply for membership?

 12:08 <DiogoConstantino> I've also done some promoting of Ubuntu, by doing talks about Ubuntu in community events

 12:08 <Wild_Man> DiogoConstantino, do you have plans to get involved in the Ubuntu community in other ways, like offering support?

 12:09 <DiogoConstantino> I took so long for several reasons, not that good reasons

 12:09 <Kilos> ok

 12:10 <DiogoConstantino> one was that I dind't felt it was affecting my hability to contribute

 12:10 <DiogoConstantino> the other was the wiki itself it really is not working that well, and this means I needed to have some time to prepare it

 12:11 <Wild_Man> That's a very good way to look at it

 12:11 <Kilos> agreed

 12:11 <DiogoConstantino> on second question I do litle of that

 12:11 <DiogoConstantino> usually on community in person events

 12:11 <DiogoConstantino> or on our ubuntu-pt telegram group

 12:11 <DiogoConstantino> but there's no much record of it

 12:12 <DiogoConstantino> so I didn't mentioned it

 12:12 <DiogoConstantino> on the wiki

 12:13 <DiogoConstantino> it's also on my plans to incentivize the ubuntu-pt community to use more askubuntu

 12:13 <DiogoConstantino> so that will likely lead to more of that by me and others

 12:13 <diddledan> Any more questions? I'll also open the floor for anyone else in here to contribute their testimonials

 12:14 <Kilos> diddledan do your supporters want to add anything

 12:14 <Bashing-om> Solid candidate - I have no questions or further issues to discuss.

 12:14 <Wild_Man> No questions

 12:14 <tylnesh> Hello! I'd like to contribute a testimonial, if it's still needed

 12:15 <diddledan> Kilos: tabfail :-p

 12:15 <jpt_pt_94> Great candidate

 12:15 <DiogoConstantino> tylnesh jaime tcarreira Christoph3 ?

 12:15 <Wild_Man> Please feel free to do so tylnesh

 12:15 <Christoph3> good morning to all, i would like to share my testimonial about Constantino

 12:16 <Kilos> hi Christoph3 go  ahead

 12:16 <tylnesh> Diogo is an amazing candidate for Ubuntu Membership and I was honestly surprised he wasn't a member already. He's been part of and organized several European Ubuntu events, and is very helpful even to the smallest of communities.

 12:17 <Wild_Man> Thank you tylnesh for your testimonial

 12:17 <tylnesh> He's been a great moral support and gave guidance in our effort to restore the Czech-slovakian Ubuntu community as well.

 12:18 <Kilos> great

 12:18 <Christoph3> he "Diogo Constantino" and the ubuntu-pt group has been great for me personally , learning things about linux everyday, his podcast teaches a lot about linux to newbies like myself specially in the times that we are now security is a must and thanks to Diogo ans his ubuntu-pt mates I learned a lot about how to protect my self and do things the

 12:18 <Christoph3> right way

 12:18 <Kilos> diddledan up to you

 12:19 <diddledan> thank you Christoph3 :-)
