 15:01 <dbungert> doesn't trigger this though, so how do we get even into this state?

 15:01 <dbungert> * Subiquity - use networkctl instead of harsher process restarts thru systemd -

 15:01 <dbungert> while the idea seems sound, networkctl on bionic/focal has features missing

 15:01 <dbungert> that I'm using, so either I need a different solution or a vendored backport

 15:01 <dbungert> * LP: #1925722 - fix for curtin where, when we're formatting multiple disks and

 15:11 <mclemenceau> Ok I'll card it

 15:11 <bdmurray> bug 1842047 was raised by the community team so we should card that too

 15:13 <bdmurray> juliank: You had an opinion on this?

 15:13 <juliank> Right, sort of don't see how it fits in with resilient boot having ESPs on multiple drives

 15:13 <juliank> which might be different than the /

 15:13 <bdmurray> Okay, then lets punt it while you and xnox discuss it

 15:14 <bdmurray> bug 1925625

 15:14 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 1925625 could not be found

 15:14 <bdmurray> bug 1925265

 15:14 <ubottu> bug 1925265 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Fresh install of hirsute-preinstalled-desktop-arm64+raspi has packages to autoremove" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1925265

 15:14 <bdmurray> That just seemed weird to me but is it worth working on?

 15:16 <bdmurray> It probably isn't raspi-image specific

 15:16 <sil2100> I think we should take it

 15:16 <sil2100> Would be nice to do a clean up of our preinstalled images in that case, as it might also be the same case for riscv

 15:17 <bdmurray> Okay, let's take it.

 15:18 <mclemenceau> ok

 15:18 <sil2100> Ok, missed the part it's about desktop, so uh, but still

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1925483 was release noted so is something we should think about

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1925483 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Initial user login after ubiquity starts X11 desktop, not Wayland" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1925483

 15:20 <bdmurray> If its fixed after reboot the question might be is there a substantially different user experience.

 15:21 <bdmurray> Given the performance difference lets take it.

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1925529

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1925529 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) ""ReleaseNotesViewer" does not display anything with the text view" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1925529

 15:22 <bdmurray> Given that we were using the release announcement to convey important information this seems worth fixing.

 15:22 <bdmurray> So let's card that.

 15:22 <bdmurray> bug 1925745

 15:22 <ubottu> bug 1925745 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Hirsute: Cannot install ubuntu-desktop due to unmet dependencies" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1925745

 15:23 <bdmurray> juliank: I tagged this one because of the user experience with regards to sorting out what phasing meant.

 15:24 <juliank> ack

 15:24 <mclemenceau> carded the previous 2

 15:24 <bdmurray> Do you have any ideas how it might be more informative?

 15:24 <bdmurray> thanks!

 15:24 <juliank> not sure how this happened

 15:25 <juliank> There's nothing we can do to make apt tell you more information really

 15:25 <bdmurray> it was a 0 day SRU (I think) that we didn't fully phase

 15:25 <juliank> bzut ubuntu-release-upgrader-gtk should be phasing identical to ubuntu-release-upgrader-core

 15:25 <juliank> so it should install ubuntu-release-upgrader-gtk 21.04.10, not 21.04.11

 15:26 <bdmurray> Oh, I see.

 15:26 <juliank> I'll have to go play with it I guess

 15:27 <bdmurray> Okay, thanks so let's move it to apt and card it.

 15:27 <bdmurray> bug 1924823

 15:27 <ubottu> bug 1924823 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "ESP on install medium automatically configured as ESP for install, failing install" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1924823

 15:28 <juliank> yes, we want to solve this more properly I think

 15:28 <juliank> It's not super urgent

 15:29 <bdmurray> Should we still card it then?

 15:29 <juliank> yeah

 15:29 <mclemenceau> ok

 15:29 <juliank> I figured out what's going on with the phasing, and it's sort of Laney's fault ;)

 15:30 <Laney> what

 15:30 <juliank> Laney: You said new installs should not be phasing :D

 15:30 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-hh-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:30 <juliank> Laney: Now if you have a package installed from same source package like u-r-u-core, installing u-r-u-gtk will fail :D

 15:30 <juliank> Laney: So I need to invent more magic to fix that :D

 15:31 <juliank> Laney: But mostly just joking about it being your fault :D

 15:31 <bdmurray> moving on then to bug 1919177 which was release noted

 15:31 <ubottu> bug 1919177 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "Azure: issues with accelerated networking on Hirsute" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1919177

 15:32 <vorlon> ... or revisit this "new installs should not be phasing" assertion?

 15:32 <juliank> vorlon: Need to read the backlog, but I agreed with the argument

 15:33 <bdmurray> lets card that so we track helping out the CPC team

 15:33 <bdmurray> bug 1926267

 15:33 <ubottu> bug 1926267 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "do-release-upgrade failed silently after failed to connect to snap service" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1926267

 15:34 <bdmurray> There's an mp there so I'll card it

 15:34 <bdmurray> bug 1923477 was also release noted

 15:34 <ubottu> bug 1923477 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Impish) "No WiFi on installed system if drivers were installed using 'Additional Drivers' in live-session before starting the installer." [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1923477

 15:35 <bdmurray> And that's a pretty poor experience so let's card that

 15:35 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:36 <bdmurray> bug 1921427

 15:37 <bdmurray> looking at the error tracker there aren't a ton of crashes about this

 15:37 <bdmurray> so let's pass on it for now

 15:38 <bdmurray> bug 1921593 I think I should test this again with the clonefile attached

 15:38 <ubottu> bug 1921593 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "do-release-upgrade fails with no error" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1921593

 15:38 <bdmurray> so passing on that

 15:38 <bdmurray> bug 1924604

 15:38 <ubottu> bug 1924604 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "do-release-upgrade crashed with KeyError in __getitem__(): "The cache has no package named 'python-is-python2'"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1924604

 15:38 <bdmurray> This can happen if universe is not enabled

 15:39 <bdmurray> vorlon: I forget did you have an opinion on this?

 15:39 <juliank> Laney: that was you right, who said t

 15:39 <juliank> oops, sorry

 15:39 <juliank> Wrong keys pressed + backlog

 15:40 <vorlon> bdmurray: I think the opinion I offerred is that we shouldn't be excessively concerned about making an upgrade "work" under those circumstances, we should just make sure we don't crash ugly

 15:40 <bdmurray> I think the current behavior could be called ugly

 15:40 * vorlon nods

 15:40 <bdmurray> so let's card that

 15:41 <bdmurray> bug 1925972

 15:41 <ubottu> bug 1925972 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Upgrade from 18.04 to 20.04 not calculatable if python-bson-ext is installed" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1925972

 15:41 <bdmurray> so there are still a lot of upgrade failures from B to F

 15:41 <bdmurray> this might be one reason why

 15:42 <bdmurray> I didn't find out why python-bson-ext is causing upgrade failures but its definitely that python2 quirk

 15:42 <bdmurray> so let's card that too

 15:42 <bdmurray> bug 1920107

 15:42 <ubottu> bug 1920107 in finalrd (Ubuntu) "Failed messages of sd-umount shown with reboot/shutdown" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1920107

 15:43 <bdmurray> that's incomplete so let's pass on it

 15:44 <bdmurray> and I'm already working on bug 1924809

 15:45 <doko> skip that

 15:45 <vorlon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:45 <bdmurray> okay!

 15:45 <doko> there's nothing ready

 15:45 <vorlon> but nothing here because everything's too young after impish opened
