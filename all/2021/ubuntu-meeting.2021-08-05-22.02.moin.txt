 22:02 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board 22:00 UTC

 22:02 <meetingology> Meeting started at 22:02:57 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 22:02 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 22:03 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 5th August 2021. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:03 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:03 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:03 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:03 <diddledani> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:03 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the majority of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:03 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:03 <Guest87> Thank you diddledan

 22:03 <bashfulrobot> üëç

 22:03 <bashfulrobot> thanks for Chairing diddledani

 22:03 <diddledani> #topic dbungert

 22:04 <dbungert> Hello

 22:04 <Guest87> For the official record this is Wild Man

 22:04 <diddledani> Hi, dbungert , could you introduce yourself, and share your links to your wiki page and launchpad?

 22:04 <dbungert> Dan Bungert

 22:04 <dbungert> wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dbungert

 22:04 <dbungert> LP: https://launchpad.net/~dbungert

 22:04 <dbungert> User of Debian-like systems in various capacities since 2000 or so.

 22:04 <dbungert> Debian / Ubuntu has been a part of every job I've had since graduation.

 22:04 <dbungert> Joined Canonical in January with the Foundations team.

 22:04 <dbungert> Aspire to full upload rights eventually, and see Ubuntu Contributorship as a

 22:04 <dbungert> practice round and step in that direction.

 22:04 <bashfulrobot> welcome dbungert , and thanks for your time.

 22:05 <dbungert> Thanks, and same to you all.

 22:05 <bashfulrobot> Can you describe what you see yourself doing in the Ubuntu community itself beyond the "day job" related activities with you new position at Canonical?

 22:06 <bashfulrobot> (congrats by the way!)

 22:06 <bashfulrobot> We (the group) like to understand the more community driven direction that you have down in the past, as well as what you are considering for the future.

 22:07 <bashfulrobot> *done in the past*

 22:07 <dbungert> Sure.  I've really been enjoying the installer / iso related work, and hope to continue to learn more on that front, even beyond what is strictly needed for day job.  But that's overlappy.

 22:07 * diddledani blames the spillage chickens on your phones for auto correcting wrongly

 22:07 <dbungert> I like looking at a lot of random stuff, and we have no shortage of bugs.

 22:08 <dbungert> I have a persistent interest in tiling window manager, and am inclined to help the system76 folks get their pop-os shell into the archive

 22:09 <Guest32> This is Wild Man apologies for coming and going bad connection

 22:09 <diddledani> don't worry, Guest32 . For your benefit I'll restate what bashfulrobot asked and the response:

 22:09 <diddledani> bashfulrobot> Can you describe what you see yourself doing in the Ubuntu community itself beyond the "day job" related activities with you new position at Canonical?

 22:09 <bashfulrobot> (popshell is awesome, would love to see it outside gnome too!)

 22:09 <diddledani> dbungert> Sure.  I've really been enjoying the installer / iso related work, and hope to continue to learn more on that front, even beyond what is strictly needed for day job.  But that's overlappy.

 22:09 <diddledani> dbungert> I like looking at a lot of random stuff, and we have no shortage of bugs.

 22:10 <diddledani> dbungert> I have a persistent interest in tiling window manager, and am inclined to help the system76 folks get their pop-os shell into the archive

 22:10 <diddledani> end.

 22:10 <diddledani> :-)

 22:10 <dbungert> I'm working thru learning python, maybe there can be some interesting project I can expand on that would continue that goal.  That's also day job overlappy though.

 22:11 <diddledani> overlapping is ok, we like to see a history of community engagement that isn't necessarily driven by Canonical's business objectives

 22:12 <Guest32> Does anyone have any more questions

 22:13 <diddledani> I like that you've got a couple of very good and relevant testimonials from two well known contributors

 22:13 <bashfulrobot> Have you considered taking your debian packaging skills and going for something like MOTU?

 22:13 <dbungert> I have.  MOTU or some sort of per-package sounds like a good intermediate step.

 22:14 <dbungert> My thinking on the topic is not yet much farther than that, though.

 22:14 <bashfulrobot> It's a great one as I know there is never enough people there, plus combined with the fact packaging (debs) is / seen as difficult to learn (lack of modern content)

 22:15 <Bashing-om> dbungert: You have witnesses to your credentials - great ! However, menbership has a contuing obligation - Tou have also signed the code of conduct, bow I kmaust inquire " do you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct for aslong as you are a member" ?

 22:16 <dbungert> Yes, I have signed the code of conduct and agree to abide by it, letter and spirit, as long as I am a member.

 22:17 <Bashing-om> Ouch! You have also .... now I must **

 22:17 <diddledani> any more questions from the board members?

 22:17 <bashfulrobot> I am good on my side

 22:18 <diddledani> is there anyone present that would like to offer any in-person testimonials for dbungert's application?

 22:18 <Bashing-om> my mind is made up :)

 22:19 <bashfulrobot> I am ready to vote.

 22:20 <diddledani> ok, let me start the vote then (wait for it!)
