 20:04 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 20:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:04 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:04:58 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:05 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:05 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:05 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:05 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:05 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:05 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:07 <basenji> ready?

 20:07 <Wild_Man> basenji, please introduce yourself

 20:08 <basenji> I am Bernard Stafford

 20:08 <Wild_Man> Provide links to your wiki and launchpad pages please

 20:21 <diddledani> just waiting on basenji's answer to my last question

 20:22 <basenji> I have tried to get in touch with other Afrikaans translators. no luck

 20:23 <Wild_Man> basenji, it is probably up to you to start your own team of translators in that case, it is hard to find volunteers sometimes

 20:23 <basenji> Yes if possible.

 20:29 <nicoz-> Hi everyone, my name is nico, I'm from Salerno(IT).. I have adhered to the code of conduct, I contribute to try the daily current of ubuntu and deriving, tracking bug and more... I daily help on Italian support channels and forums

 20:29 <nicoz-> my launchpad page https://launchpad.net/~nicoz91

 20:29 <nicoz-> I have already created a wiki page

 20:30 <nicoz-> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nicoz91

 20:31 <Wild_Man> You've signed the code of conduct. Did you understand everything it said and do you agree to abide by the spirit of the code of conduct?

 20:31 <nicoz-> yes

 20:32 <diddledani> we have one testimonial from nhaines on the Discourse https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nicoz-membership-application/25381

 20:32 <Bashing-om> nicoz-: You are most active in translations - what language are you working - and for how long ?

 20:33 <nicoz-> English - Italian

 20:33 <nicoz-> for at least one hour a day I dedicated myself

 20:33 <nicoz-> now I'm testing the various daily for you

 20:33 <Wild_Man> nicoz-, you mention that you are active on the forum is that the Ubuntu Forums? can we have a link to your profile on the forums that you are active on please?

 20:33 <nicoz-> https://bugs.launchpad.net/~nicoz91

 20:35 <nicoz-> just moment

 20:35 <nicoz-> https://forum.ubuntu-it.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=82309

 20:36 <nicoz-> registered since 2009

 20:36 <diddledani> I see your latest 10 translations are for fcitx in various releases of Ubuntu. Are you aware of the supported lifecycle of each release, and are you concentrating on currently-supported releases? I ask because I see several contributions against not-currently-supported releases

 20:37 <nicoz-> those that I find with less translations, regardless of the package, if it is important I can work on specific packages too

 20:38 <nicoz-> i have contribute https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+source/gnome-software

 20:39 <nicoz-> gnome-software is more important

 20:40 <nicoz-> very*

 20:41 <diddledani> are you currently a member of your local "loco"?

 20:42 <nicoz-> I have never requested it

 20:43 <nicoz-> now Italian volunteers on launchpad are ghosts :P lol

 20:43 <Kilos> nicoz-  join your local loco, always good to have friends to help close by

 20:43 <Kilos> wake up the ghosts

 20:43 <diddledani> what are your plans for the next 6 months to a year for contribution? are you going to continue your current contributions or do you intend to contribute more widely?

 20:44 <nicoz-> yes i will continue to contribute .. i have an open source debt since 2007

 20:45 <nicoz-> ever since i started using ubuntu i always wanted to repay what i got from you

 20:45 <nicoz-> i want to keep testing new versions, help #ubuntu-it users

 20:46 <Kilos> nicoz-  can you make spaghetti bolougnaise

 20:46 <diddledani> do we get sgetti?

 20:47 <Wild_Man> HAHAHA really?

 20:47 <Kilos> lol

 20:47 <Bashing-om> nicoz-: In your testing of new versions - as you encounter issues - do you make reports of the issues ?

 20:47 <nicoz-> also .. if you want to put the water to boil

 20:47 <nicoz-> ;O

 20:47 <nicoz-> :P

 20:48 <nicoz-> always basghin-om, I have the system in full reporting level

 20:48 <madhens> Okay, we really need to get arighi to apply for membership if pasta-making skill is now a qualification

 20:48 <nicoz-> I'm testing them on virtual machine, and on an hp g8

 20:49 <Kilos> madhens  its the sauce that counts

 20:49 <nicoz-> I'm also good as a cook madhens

 20:49 <nicoz-> ;)

 20:49 <diddledani> nicoz-: could you paste a link to a bug report you've filed, please?

 20:49 <Wild_Man> That makes a difference a little more difficult to report bugs that are not done on a bare metal system

 20:49 <nicoz-> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/terminator/+bug/1952504

 20:50 <Wild_Man> I received page not found

 20:50 <nicoz-> I collaborated for a bot in python for debian-it

 20:50 <diddledani> same

 20:51 <nicoz-> https://gitlab.com/linux-lab1/deb-bot

 20:51 <nicoz-> I am currently also a delegate op of #debian-it on libera

 20:53 <Wild_Man> nicoz-, please understand that debian is not Ubuntu so what you do there I do not believe counts towards membership for Ubuntu

 20:53 <nicoz-> ah ok scuse me..

 20:54 <Wild_Man> No problem at all it's all important work and I commend you for it

 20:54 <nicoz-> ;)

 20:55 <nicoz-> I try to reciprocate to the open source world

 20:56 <Wild_Man> You say you are active on the forum do you know how long it has been since your last post there?

 20:57 <nicoz-> i prefer to give support on irc

 20:57 <nicoz-> have a direct approach with the user in order to lead him to the solution, wherever possible

 20:58 <Wild_Man> I understand, we all have out preference to where we give support

 20:58 <Wild_Man> out/our

 20:58 <diddledani> are there any members of the #ubuntu-it channel that can provide supporting testimonials?

 20:59 <nicoz-> I try to always be polite and friendly with users

 20:59 <nicoz-> you can ask mapreri who sees me very often active on the channel

 20:59 <nicoz-> obviously we don't know each other

 21:00 <Kilos> nicoz-  try  and make friends with the guys on the channels you work on

 21:01 <Kilos> alsways handy to get support from known members

 21:01 <nicoz-> of course I have friends in the community

 21:01 <nicoz-> however many are not ubuntu members

 21:02 <mapreri> uh hi

 21:02 <mapreri> what's up?

 21:02 <Kilos> hi mapreri  we are looking for support for nicoz-

 21:02 <nicoz-> i was applying for mapreri membership

 21:02 <mapreri> for what?

 21:02 <mapreri> ah

 21:02 <Wild_Man> Ubuntu Membership

 21:02 <nicoz-> i was applying for membership

 21:03 <mapreri> did the process change?  back in my time one would collect endorsments in the wiki page long before the meetings :D

 21:03 <Wild_Man> It is still that way but he has none

 21:03 <nicoz-> they are already in the wiki

 21:04 <nicoz-> if it's a problem, it doesn't matter

 21:04 <mapreri> Yes, I've seen nicoz- around IRC channels for quite a long time (can't remember how long, so it's likely very long) also giving support to people.  but uh, besides that I'm afraid I don't have an impression of nicoz- :(

 21:04 <mapreri> nicoz-: they are not in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nicoz91 - where should we look for them?

 21:05 * mapreri lives in a bubble, so unless one works on the same things as me it's not easy for me to notice :(

 21:05 <nicoz-> indeed mapreri is not very active

 21:05 <nicoz-> :P

 21:06 <mapreri> nowadays I do most of my things in debian eheh :)

 21:06 <nicoz-> ;P ctte
