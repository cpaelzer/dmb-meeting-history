 16:06 <tdaitx> Short week: out Mon/Tue (holiday)

 16:06 <tdaitx> * jck 11

 16:06 <tdaitx> - reviewed jck documentation, found some bits I should be doing differently (native lib location mosly)

 16:06 <tdaitx> - created cloud-init configs for the jck-server and jck-agent; it captures dependencies, settings through debconf, some required conf files, and some 'run-once' commands

 16:06 <tdaitx> - moved away from snap, it was nice in theory but private snaps are not practical (no automated installs, no way to build from private repo)

 16:06 <tdaitx> - moving all code and config into a single repo

 16:06 <tdaitx> - single jck-server (amd64) lxd container per network + 1 test agent container for each release/arch

 16:06 <tdaitx> - cleaned up a few more failures from the runtime testsuite

 16:06 <tdaitx> - fixing agent setup for compiler testsuite (bloody thing needs a shared folder between jck server and agent)

 16:06 <tdaitx> * looked over some fixes needed before next openjdk-8 security update

 16:06 <tdaitx> (done)

 16:08 <juliank> * merged dput

 16:08 <juliank> * merged wpa -17

 16:08 <juliank> * synced wpa -20 (yay! the only patch left was session ticket, which was patched differently upstream)

 16:08 <juliank> * reviewed irssi merge from JawnSmith

 16:08 <juliank> * triaging apt bugs for stable updates. whoa there's some stuff for targetted focal in LP I forgot about

 16:08 <juliank> * discussing whether to backport the new kernel autoremoval helper in apt, or just write a smaller patch that only protects the current kernel in addition to what the shell script protects.

 16:08 <juliank> (done)

 16:08 <dbungert> * LP: #1915558 - irssi merge, done via Server team git process.

 16:08 <dbungert> * LP: #1913321 - moved to security team, MIR team generally approving. They filed a related LP for fix

 16:09 <juliank> Sorry dbungert

 16:09 <bdmurray> doko:

 16:09 <dbungert> juliank: no worries

 16:09 <doko> - looking at perl triggered autopkg tests, addressed three, one left which should be ignored. xnox lookged at freersum/s390x

 16:09 <doko> - two +1 maitenance days, see report on the u-d ML

 16:09 <doko> - worked on the wrong user/group in deb's issues

 16:10 <juliank> I think I forgot to look at failing autopkgtests from last week :(

 16:11 <bdmurray> juliank: I'll go slow so you can

 16:11 <bdmurray> #topic Release Incoming Bugs

 16:11 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-hh-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:12 <bdmurray> So is there additional work that we should card bug 1915250 for?

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1915250 in fakeroot (Ubuntu) "buildd file owner/group for shared libraries " [Critical,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1915250

 16:12 <doko> <doko> setting these to committed

 16:12 <bdmurray> Alright no then

 16:12 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-gg-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:13 <bdmurray> We talked about the tzdata bug last week

 16:13 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:13 <bdmurray> bug 1914827 I found and recreated this week

 16:13 <ubottu> bug 1914827 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "18.04 to 20.04 upgrade failed until -dbg packages removed" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1914827

 16:14 <juliank> fun

 16:14 <bdmurray> the python is python2 stuff has a list of packages and depending on how they are ordered the upgrade can succeed or fail

 16:14 <juliank> I always worry fixing one bug unfixes another one :D

 16:14 <bdmurray> Yeah

 16:14 <juliank> But sounds right

 16:15 <bdmurray> So it sorted out the upgrade in bug 1914827 but didn't fix bug 1915346

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1914827 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "18.04 to 20.04 upgrade failed until -dbg packages removed" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1914827

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1915346 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Upgrade to LTS 20.04 fails" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1915346

 16:15 <juliank> The right fix obviously is to make order not matter, but that's harder with the way the code is written (though we have the card for that :D)

 16:16 <bdmurray> juliank: so do you suggest trying to reorder it in a way that works for most cases?

 16:16 <juliank> Should we try to fix individual bugs or move the rework higher up in priority?

 16:17 <juliank> bdmurray: Hard question we can't really know we really ought to collect test cases so we can see if changes cause regressions

 16:17 <juliank> bdmurray: Arguably minimal first should be right I guess

 16:17 <juliank> So it's something we probably should od

 16:17 <bdmurray> juliank: okay, that's trivial so lets do that first and see what we are left with.

 16:17 <bdmurray> let's target and card that then

 16:18 <bdmurray> then we have a couple of hwe-support-status bugs

 16:18 <mclemenceau> done then: carded!

 16:18 <bdmurray> bug 1908794

 16:18 <ubottu> bug 1908794 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager-core: hwe-support-status recommends 18.04 on 20.04" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1908794

 16:18 <bdmurray> bug 1907083

 16:18 <ubottu> bug 1907083 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "hwe-support-status fails without displaying unsupported packages" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1907083

 16:19 <bdmurray> It looks like hwe-support-status didn't get updated for focal :-(

 16:19 <bdmurray> Oh hey that one is already carded -sorry

 16:19 <bdmurray> same with the other

 16:19 <xnox> doko:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/RustUpdates updated

 16:20 <bdmurray> so then bug 1915923

 16:20 <ubottu> bug 1915923 in pciutils (Ubuntu) "update-pciids in pciutils fails to create hard link" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1915923

 16:20 <bdmurray> They've identified the fix but how important is update-pciids?

 16:21 <xnox> bdmurray:  makes shiny new hardware work

 16:21 <bdmurray> Like when does it get used?

 16:21 <xnox> bdmurray:  if no shiny, no need.

 16:22 <bdmurray> so let's target and card that

 16:23 <mclemenceau> ok then.

 16:24 <bdmurray> so then bug 1915887 paride has set to incomplete but if there's a systemd expert who could chime in that might help.

 16:24 <ubottu> bug 1915887 in xl2tpd (Ubuntu) "systemd spams the syslog about lack of native systemd unit file" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1915887

 16:24 <bdmurray> that's that

 16:24 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:24 <bdmurray> vorlon:

 16:24 <vorlon> aaand my browser chooses this moment to have a fit

 16:25 <dbungert> just feed it more ram

 16:25 <vorlon> ok here we go

 16:25 <paride> ðŸ‘€

 16:25 <vorlon> well that made me look, and why is matterhorn taking 2.8G

 16:25 <vorlon> anyway

 16:26 <vorlon> pexpect: tdaitx, any progress?

 16:26 <bdmurray> somebody's emojis I'm sure

 16:26 <tdaitx> vorlon: none

 16:27 <vorlon> tdaitx: are you ok to carry it over?

 16:27 <xnox> i mean we were frozen for a while.

 16:27 <vorlon> xnox: doesn't prevent reproducing and fixing source bugs :)

 16:27 <tdaitx> vorlon: sure =)

 16:27 <vorlon> ok

 16:27 <vorlon> mtd-utils/iniparser, I know dbungert is working on

 16:28 <vorlon> e2fsprogs is me, carrying over

 16:28 <vorlon> systemd vs iproute2 is me, carrying over

 16:28 <vorlon> xfsprogs is blocked on the libnih MIR

 16:28 <vorlon> JawnSmith: any movement on acl?  still showing systemd autopkgtest regressions on amd64 and ppc64el

 16:29 <JawnSmith> I had thought the new systemd would resolve that but it doesn't seem to have so I started digging deeper yesterday

 16:29 <JawnSmith> will carry over

 16:29 <vorlon> might be as simple as a retry with different hints?

 16:29 <vorlon> ok

 16:30 <vorlon> perl: doko?

 16:30 <doko> just asked ubuntu-release to badtest

 16:30 <vorlon> ok

 16:30 <doko> the others are all fixed

 16:30 <vorlon> iputils is also JawnSmith, amd64+ppc64el systemd failures

 16:30 <vorlon> juliank: setuptools?

 16:31 <juliank> yep, I should give it an actual try this week

 16:31 <vorlon> ok

 16:32 <JawnSmith> carded iputils so it doesn't slip through the cracks

 16:32 <vorlon> sbuild vs qemu, likely just flakiness, I'll retry

 16:32 <vorlon> systemd vs qemu, hasn't been tried with a recent systemd, I'll retry

 16:33 <vorlon> socat: bdmurray?

 16:33 <vorlon> dh-autoreconf: xnox?

 16:33 <bdmurray> +1 socat

 16:34 <vorlon> systemd blocking policykit-1, I'll retry with recent systemd

 16:34 <vorlon> erlang: sil2100?

 16:35 <sil2100> On it o/

 16:35 <vorlon> python3.9: slyon?

 16:35 <slyon> yes!

 16:35 <vorlon> glibc I'm pretty sure is rbalint

 16:36 <vorlon> libtype-tiny-perl: waveform?

 16:36 <rbalint> :-)

 16:36 <waveform> vorlon, ok

 16:36 <vorlon> then a whole bunch of stuff that is blocked on either glibc or perl which we'll ignore

 16:37 <vorlon> cross-toolchain-base: dbungert?

 16:37 <xnox> vorlon:  ok.

 16:37 <dbungert> +1 cross-toolchain-base

 16:37 <vorlon> dbungert: or rather, elfutils which is blocked by cross-toolchain-base + others

 16:37 <dbungert> OK

 16:38 <vorlon> so unfortunately the queue is growing but I don't necessarily want to assign out a whole second round today.  Hopefully a lot of these just clear up once glibc is unstuck and we can have a better look next week

 16:38 <doko> dbungert, vorlon: c-t-b is a timeout. just needs more time

 16:38 <vorlon> why does it need more time now than before?

 16:38 <juliank> I can give it more time, I suppose

 16:39 <juliank> ah arm?

 16:39 <juliank> We get new faster hardware, so hesitant

 16:40 <vorlon> well, having a longer timeout that doesn't get used doesn't hurt much

 16:40 <vorlon> and we're not live on the new hardware yet

 16:40 <vorlon> anyway, stopping there

 16:40 <vorlon> bdmurray:

 16:40 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:41 <bdmurray> Anything else going on / worth sharing?

 16:41 <slyon> I'll be out on Monday

 16:41 <dbungert> juliank: so if I understand correctly, I should leave c-t-b alone and you'll extend the timeout?

 16:42 <juliank> I need to talk to La_ney and see wrt hardware changes if it needs a longer timeout or will be good

 16:42 <dbungert> vorlon: if you like you can give me a different one

 16:42 <juliank> Ah but I think it jumps forth and back

 16:42 <vorlon> dbungert: libselinux, then

 16:42 <dbungert> +1 libselinux

 16:43 <juliank> vorlon: We are live on armhf fwiw, at least with 1/3

 16:43 <juliank> :D

 16:43 <juliank> So I guess some arm64 pick up new HW too?

 16:44 <juliank> (same openstack cloud, no way to specify which one you get)

 16:44 <vorlon> so it's live in bos02 but I haven't raised an RT yet to increase our quota

 16:44 <vorlon> yes, we'll get some faster nodes in there, some slower

 16:45 <juliank> vorlon: ok Laney is migrating armhf runners to fast nodes only basically

 16:45 <vorlon> mazel tov

 16:46 <juliank> Optimally we'd prefer run long tests on fast nodes, and others on slower nodes

 16:46 <juliank> but probably too hard :D

 16:47 <vorlon> well, spinning instances up and down until you get one on the node you prefer is not a good idea

 16:48 <juliank> yeah, maybe they can have tags or something one could use

 16:49 <juliank> anyhow, more ubuntu - release business
