 14:32 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:32 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:32:47 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:32 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:33 <cpaelzer> ping didrocks999 jamespage ddstreet doko sarnold for MIR meeting

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I have seen a few enter our queue

 14:33 <cpaelzer> so today will be no no-op :-/

 14:33 <cpaelzer> going quickly to the default agenda items

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:33 <cpaelzer> none

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> while the amount of continuous "known false positives" gets a bit embarrassing

 14:34 <cpaelzer> still IMHO all in there are known caes one or the other way

 14:34 <cpaelzer> going on ...

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:34 <sarnold> even debian-installer?

 14:34 * cpaelzer rewinds a bit

 14:35 <cpaelzer> it came from a seed so I might have looked at it from the wrong angle

 14:35 <cpaelzer> the linked MIR is from 2011

 14:35 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-linaro-mx51/+bug/742430

 14:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 742430 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "FFe to start making mx51 images" [Wishlist, Won't Fix]

 14:35 <cpaelzer> that has nothing to do with the change

 14:35 <cpaelzer> let me check germinate if it lists that directly

 14:36 <cpaelzer> and maybe someone check the seeds?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> debian-installer                                            | debian-installer                               | Ubuntu.Impish supported-installer-common seed               | Ubuntu Installer Team <ubuntu-installer@lists.ubuntu.com>      |            1582 |             101

 14:36 <cpaelzer> hmm

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/platform/tree/supported-installer-common#n3

 14:38 <cpaelzer> according to the comment this might now be an almost empty package

 14:38 <cpaelzer> https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/platform/commit?id=510128ae1f7e66be563d98486ef09c981da40f2a

 14:38 <cpaelzer> but still xnox or foundations I guess still need a quick MIR to document this for promoting it

 14:38 <cpaelzer> xnox: will you open one?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> doko isn't around otherwise he'd carry it to the team

 14:39 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold for spotting

 14:39 <cpaelzer> back to new bug list until we get a response

 14:39 <cpaelzer> new MIR https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/egl-wayland/+bug/1935082

 14:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1935082 in egl-wayland (Ubuntu) "[MIR] egl-wayland" [Undecided, New]

 14:39 <cpaelzer> needs review volunteer

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I'm on sprint and +1 this week and then on PTO, so I can't this time

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: we keep you busy with the security review side of this - so maybe not you either

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: you said you might be available on pings - any chance to review ^^ ?

 14:40 <ddstreet> sure thing, assign it to me

 14:41 <cpaelzer> thank you and done

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:41 <cpaelzer> fuse we have talked enough last week in IRC and on the various bugs

 14:41 <cpaelzer> everything else is even older

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:42 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:42 <cpaelzer> nothing from me other than being too busy to properly focus :-/

 14:42 <cpaelzer> most othes seem to be unavailable atm anyway

 14:42 <sarnold> that's not easy in the best of times..

 14:42 <cpaelzer> please feel free to bring a topic up via mail if you have one

 14:43 <cpaelzer> let us close this for today then

 14:43 <cpaelzer> o/

 14:43 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, ddstreet :)
