 12:02 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board 15th December 2021

 12:02 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:02:59 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:03 <diddledani> here comes the paste!

 12:03 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 15th December 2021. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:03 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:03 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:03 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:03 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:03 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:03 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:04 <diddledani> #topic CodeMouse92 (Jason C. McDonald)

 12:04 <diddledani> Hi, CodeMouse92 , can you introduce yourself to the board, and provide the links to your wiki page/discourse post and LP profile?

 12:04 <CodeMouse92> Hi diddledani, sure.

 12:05 <CodeMouse92> My name is Jason C. McDonald. I'm an author, speaker, and senior software engineer, presently working on the Canonical Public Cloud team at Canonical...

 12:05 <CodeMouse92> I've been using Ubuntu since about 2012, and been a part of the IRC community for about that long...

 12:06 <CodeMouse92> Perhaps most significantly for membership qualification, I run a year-long internship program through MousePaw Media, my open source organization. Ubuntu is our operating system of choice, and I've introduced many young developers to Ubuntu, Linux, and open source in general.

 12:07 <CodeMouse92> I also enjoy fixing computers for people as a hobby, and have introduced many people to Ubuntu that way as well. Turns out, many people who struggle to understand Windows do great on Ubuntu with a few minutes of orientation!

 12:07 <CodeMouse92> LP: https://launchpad.net/~codemouse92

 12:07 <CodeMouse92> Thank you. :)

 12:08 <diddledani> Thank you CodeMouse92 . I'll now open the floor to the board members to ask any questions.

 12:09 <Bashing-om> CodeMouse92: In addition to your "work" - have you not been active in support on the IRC channels ?

 12:09 <diddledani> Firsts up from me, You've signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. Can you confirm that you understood the code when you signed it and affirm that you will follow the code while you are a member?

 12:09 <CodeMouse92> Bashing-om: I have on occasion, although not frequently.

 12:10 <CodeMouse92> diddledani: Absolutely.

 12:10 <diddledani> awesome :-) (that's just a formality, but we have to confirm it ;-p)

 12:12 <Kilos> CodeMouse92  are you a member of your local loco

 12:12 <Kilos> or any other loco?

 12:12 <CodeMouse92> Kilos: I actually didn't know that was a thing until this moment. I just moved to this state, so I'm only just learning what's here.

 12:13 <diddledani> Getting involved with your loco (if it's active) is a good thing, though not all the locos are active (like mine, in the UK)

 12:13 <Kilos> I am impressed with your work, joining a loco gives you more people to guide and team up with

 12:14 <CodeMouse92> Ahhhhh, Tony Yarusso is the admin of that one. I know him. Yeah, I'll reach out and find out more.

 12:14 <Kilos> cool

 12:15 <diddledani> any more questions?

 12:15 <CodeMouse92> (Hmm. Ubuntu US MN looks inactive. I'll still talk to Tony.)

 12:16 <madhens> We should be hearing more from the LoCo research group the CC started in the new year, too

 12:16 <diddledani> yey

 12:17 <Kilos> many locos have faded because of all the new ways of communication nowadays, but still good to be part of them and help them grow back again

 12:17 <Bashing-om> madhens: Yeah - was going to mention that a big effort is ongoing to rejuvenate.

 12:18 <diddledani> If there's no more questions I'll open the vote (wait for the bot!)

 12:18 <Kilos> telegram and facebook have stolen many. to my dismay

 12:21 <diddledani> #topic youngbin

 12:22 <diddledani> Hi, youngbin , can you introduce yourself to the board and post the links to your wiki page/discourse post, and your Launchpad profile?

 12:22 <youngbin> Sure diddledani :) Hello everyone, I'm Youngbin Han.

 12:23 <youngbin> I first met Ubuntu in 2021 and joined Korean LoCo to learn more and meet people interested about Ubuntu. I'm currently representative of Korean LoCo, and also organizer of last UbuCon Asia 2021.

 12:24 * diddledani corrects - you met Ubuntu in 2012 ;-p

 12:24 <diddledani> silly numbers!

 12:24 <youngbin> As Organizer of Korean LoCo, I've organizing many Ubuntu related activities in Korea. such as: seminars, workshops, cowork with other local open source communities.

 12:25 <youngbin> + I wonder how other LoCos in Asia organize their activities. So, I organized the first UbuCon Asia to reach diverse LoCos in Asia and share knowledge and experience with them.

 12:26 <youngbin> I'm also currently student at Sungkonghow University and DevOps Engineer Cloudmate(based on Seoul). Nice to meet you all :)

 12:27 <diddledani> bah I suck at emoji

 12:27 <diddledani> 🙋‍♀️

 12:27 <youngbin> That emoji looks nice :)

 12:28 <diddledani> ok, I'll let the board members have a read through your pages, and ask any questions

 12:28 <youngbin> 👌

 12:28 <Kilos> hehe

 12:28 <diddledani> First question from me, same as I asked CodeMouse92 , You've signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. Can you confirm that you understood the code when you signed it and affirm that you will follow the code while you are a member?

 12:29 <youngbin> Sure, Of course :)

 12:29 <diddledani> great!

 12:30 <diddledani> next question, and completely for my own curiosity, did the UbuCon Asia go well? Will you be organising another one?

 12:32 <youngbin> Yes, But we should see how situation (COVID-19 situation) goes next year. then we should decide whether organize online or in-person.

 12:32 <Kilos> great

 12:32 <youngbin> I thinking ask organizers and make decision on late Q1 2022

 12:32 <diddledani> that makes sense. The world is making in-person so difficult right now

 12:33 * diddledani pokes the world with a pointy stick

 12:33 <Kilos> haha

 12:33 <madhens> Silly world. Be better.

 12:33 <diddledani> Kilos, Bashing-om, do you have any questions?
