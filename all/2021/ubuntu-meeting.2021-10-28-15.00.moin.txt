 15:04 <juliank> oh it's me time

 15:04 <juliank> * reviewed ChromeOS shim submission

 15:04 <juliank> * python-apt 2.3.0: fixes for Python 3.10

 15:04 <juliank> * digging hard into the autopkgtest cloud

 15:05 <juliank> - acquire build-adt-image lock for ensure-adt-image@ as well so we don't end up with dupes

 15:05 <juliank> - stop several image building processes stuck for over a day

 15:05 <juliank> - implement 15 min timeouts for openstack commands and a 1 hour overall timeout for image building so

 15:05 <juliank> we always fail on the same day, so next day can build images again

 15:05 <juliank> - dig into space usage of images; find out openstack does not have discard, so any blocks we wrote

 15:05 <juliank> on images were marked as used, so given we loop boot/upgrade/store new image for impish/jammy,

 15:05 <juliank> it grew. Got IS to setup sync for base images for impish/jammy so we can build from a small image again.

 15:05 <juliank> - as a followup, found out that the regex for finding the base images did not actually match the devel dailies due to inappropriate ?: "non-capturing group" in grep -E (needs -P)

 15:05 <juliank> - implemented early code for deleting obsolete queues (e.g. groovy)

 15:05 <juliank> - found out we don't "support" trusty on the cloud, not sure if it's being used, it might still work regardless

 15:05 <juliank> - improved graphs a bit by adding 5 min minimum interval

 15:05 <juliank> => our images should all be cleaned up by tomorrow

 15:05 <juliank> (done)

 15:25 <bdmurray> vorlon: Is the queue quiesced enough that its worth looking at this?

 15:25 <vorlon> bdmurray: no

 15:25 <bdmurray> okay

 15:25 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:25 <vorlon> hopefully some of the changes juliank+IS have made to image handling on jammy will soon cause the queues to drain faster, but there's still a huge backlog right now

 15:25 <jawn-smith> I will be out Thurs Nov 4

 15:26 * juliank is not optimistic, having rebuilt jammy bos02 ppc64el image already a couple hours ago
