 16:05 <jgrimm> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:05 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue May 17 16:05:32 2016 UTC.  The chair is jgrimm. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:05 <meetingology> 

 16:05 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:06 <jgrimm> hi folks!!  i think there are a few people out this week or busy.

 16:06 <jgrimm> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:07 <jgrimm> No action points listed. cool

 16:07 <jgrimm> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:07 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule

 16:08 <jgrimm> good time to get some merges in of course..

 16:08 <nacc> to that end, the importer is almost done for v1

 16:08 <jgrimm> #link https://merges.ubuntu.com/main.html

 16:08 <nacc> i'm verifying manually a few example merges

 16:08 <nacc> example imports, rather

 16:09 <nacc> while it might get deleted, you can see one example here: https://git.launchpad.net/~nacc/ubuntu/+source/open-vm-tools/log/?h=ubuntu/devel

 16:09 <jgrimm> nacc, do you plan to send an email out to ml, with instructions/examples/request for help testing?

 16:09 <nacc> smoser: --^ you might esp. be interested as that is a full history, of sorts

 16:09 <nacc> jgrimm: yep, i'll 'announce' when v1 is ready, i'll need to discuss with rbasak too if we're going to setup a staging project before moving to usd officially

 16:10 <nacc> jgrimm: feel free to give me an action for that

 16:10 <smoser> nacc, that is awesome!

 16:10 <jgrimm> #action nacc to announce v1 importer to ubuntu server world

 16:10 * meetingology nacc to announce v1 importer to ubuntu server world

 16:10 <jgrimm> when rdy of course. :)

 16:11 <jgrimm> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:11 <nacc> smoser: i'm still verifying it's correct, which is slow & manual, and i think open-vm-tools in particular had a break in the history (hence there's an orphan'd tag in th emiddle)

 16:11 <smoser> nacc, is '%' a : ?

 16:11 <nacc> smoser: but it handles syncs and merges properly, i think, so that's something :)

 16:11 <smoser> Merge with import/2%10.0.7-3227872-2

 16:11 <nacc> smoser: yes, that's the dep-14 translation

 16:11 <smoser> ok.

 16:11 <jgrimm> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:12 <nacc> ~ -> _ and % -> :

 16:12 <nacc> smoser: --^ (from http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep14/)

 16:12 <nacc> smoser: we're going to update git-dsc-commit accordingly too

 16:13 <jgrimm> moving on..

 16:13 <nacc> ack

 16:13 <jgrimm> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:13 <caribou> nothing to report this week

 16:13 <jgrimm> thanks caribou

 16:13 <nacc> so i have one server bug for xenial -- related to samba

 16:13 <nacc> LP: #997172

 16:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 997172 in smbldap-tools (Ubuntu) "smbldap-config.pl not installed" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/997172

 16:13 <teward> o/ (late)

 16:14 <nacc> it's fixed upstream by http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/smbldap-tools/trunk/Makefile.in?r1=155&r2=156&

 16:14 <nacc> but i'm not sure that's an acceptable thing to SRU? it shouldn't lead to any regression, as the perl script simply isn't present right now...

 16:14 <jgrimm> nacc, cool. 2012 filed bug.

 16:15 <nacc> but serverguide is broken/not possible to fix without that bug being resolved (and in fact mentions that bug explicitly as the reason it's wrong :)

 16:16 <jgrimm> nacc, i haven't read full bug.. what would be reason for not SRUing it?

 16:16 <nacc> jgrimm: i wasn't sure if there were rules about adding a new executable to the contents of a package already published

 16:17 <nacc> jgrimm: i guess it's going somewhere into /usr/share/doc, so maybe it shouldn't be too big of a deal

 16:17 <nacc> jgrimm: just wanted to double-check and then i'll fix the bug and serverguide

 16:17 <jgrimm> nacc, sounds good

 16:17 <jgrimm> anyone else?

 16:18 <cpaelzer> IMHO - regression potential is the main question, and that seems low to none

 16:18 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:18 <smb> Nothing new this week. So far the Yakkety kernel still is a rolled forward Xenial one.

 16:18 <jgrimm> thanks smb

 16:18 <jgrimm> any questions for kernel team?

 16:18 <nacc> cpaelzer: ack, thanks

 16:19 <jgrimm> moving on

 16:19 <jgrimm> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:20 <jgrimm> not seeing anything interesting on lwn CFP calendar

 16:20 <jgrimm> pycon is coming up at end of month

 16:21 <jgrimm> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21 <jgrimm> #topic Open Discussion

 16:21 <teward> just to put this out there, i'll be putting out a call for testing in maybe a week - installation, and upgrade-from-current-version - for nginx.

 16:22 <jgrimm> thanks teward

 16:22 <jgrimm> so one thing i've meant to mention is that I've started unsubscribing 'Ubuntu Server Team" from openstack packages.

 16:22 <teward> i'm almost finished getting a merge prepped, but before I push it in, I need more than my own basic tests - i'll send to ubuntu-server ML when that's ready

 16:22 <jgrimm> thanks

 16:22 <teward> yep  :)

 16:23 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: I also saw you went into discussion with the openstack Team for cases where it is not 100% clear if it is server or openstack

 16:23 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: will you do that for all packages that you consider "openstack"?

 16:24 <cpaelzer> like rabbitmq this week IIRC

 16:24 <cpaelzer> last week

 16:24 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, there will be some packages that we jointly support

 16:24 <jgrimm> rabbitmq is probably all ours tho as independently useful

 16:24 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: nice, this will help the bug overview - Thank!

 16:25 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, yes.. it cleans up a bunch of reports to make them actually useful for both of our teams

 16:25 <cpaelzer> the general clarification - not that "we" got rabbitmq :-)

 16:26 <jgrimm> :)

 16:26 <jgrimm> anyone else?

 16:26 <jgrimm> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:27 <jgrimm> Tuesday 2016-05-24 at 1600 UTC  .. jamespage to chair

 16:27 <jgrimm> and that's a wrap. Thanks folks!

 16:27 <cpaelzer> thanks jgrimm, o/ everybody

 16:27 <jgrimm> #endmeeting
