 16:08 <gnuoy> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:08 <smb> The 4.6 kernel update for yakkety unfortunately got delayed due to tooling/archive issues. I would expect a new attempt soonish, but I said something like that before

 16:09 <smb> The new libvirt-2.1.0 went up as planned

 16:09 <gnuoy> thanks for the update smb

 16:09 <gnuoy> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:09 <gnuoy> i dont have anything and no one else speaking up

 16:09 <jgrimm> smb, is there usually a corresponding update to python-libvirt needed?

 16:10 <jgrimm> smb, i haven't checked just noticed that versions seemed to be somewhat lockstepped in the past

 16:10 <smb> jgrimm, hm... probably that might have slipped through the cracks

 16:11 <jgrimm> smb, cool.. may not be relevant just a thought that crossed my mind reviewing outstanding merges

 16:11 <smb> jgrimm, Not sure either whether my limited upload rights are including that

 16:11 <smb> jgrimm, I guess it should be done

 16:11 <jgrimm> smb, if you don't have time let me know.. i'll find someone

 16:12 <smb> jgrimm, I think its not so much time as can do it

 16:12 * smb is no core-dev

 16:12 <jgrimm> smb, only has a single ubuntu patch.. hopefullly an easy merge

 16:13 <gnuoy> apologies for the trigger happy topic change

 16:13 <gnuoy> anyone know of any calls for papers?

 16:13 <jgrimm> smb, no worries, just let me know if you want to take or pass along

 16:13 <smb> jgrimm, I think I opt for pass along

 16:13 <jgrimm> smb, :)

 16:14 <jgrimm> thanks for tackling libvirt!

 16:14 <smb> yw

 16:14 <jgrimm> gnuoy, ok, i'm done
