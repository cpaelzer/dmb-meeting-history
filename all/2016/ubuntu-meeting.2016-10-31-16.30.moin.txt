 16:32 <ratliff> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I'm still in the happy place this week

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I have a couple of updates I'm testing

 16:32 <mdeslaur> and I'm working on a couple of embargoed issues

 16:32 <mdeslaur> that's about it for me

 16:32 <mdeslaur> hrm, who's next?

 16:33 <ratliff> chrisccoulson ?

 16:33 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:33 <chrisccoulson> this week, I'll be mostly working on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oxide/+spec/ubuntu-webview-implementation, which is blocking a bunch of personal-related work we discussed at the sprint

 16:34 <chrisccoulson> I need to publish Oxide (it's all tested already). I don't have any other updates planned

 16:34 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:35 <ratliff> I'll jump in and go next. We have some team members out due to illness, appointments, and vacation.

 16:35 <ratliff> I'm on CVE triage this week.

 16:36 <ratliff> I'm working on a project to review open CVEs for universe packages.

 16:37 <ratliff> for the record, sarnold is on bug triage and tyhicks is on community this week

 16:38 <ratliff> jjohansen: do you want to go next?

 16:38 <jjohansen> sure

 16:40 <jjohansen> I'm trying to finish up some gsettings review and related work, and I have some bugs to look at (and file), there is a memory leak, and lxd related issue with some files being passed into the container. Neither of which have bugs yet

 16:40 <jjohansen> oh and I need to upstream the change_hat() fix

 16:40 <jjohansen> cboltz really needs that one

 16:40 <jjohansen> thats it for me ratliff back to you

 16:40 <ratliff> thank you!
