 16:33 <tyhicks> Thank you for your assistance in keeping Ubuntu users secure! :)

 16:33 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:33 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:33 <jdstrand> hello

 16:33 <jdstrand> keep snappy interfaces going (ie, discussions and MP reviews)

 16:33 <jdstrand> continue snappy policy for snappy on classic

 16:33 <jdstrand> start looking at snappy developer mode

 16:34 <jdstrand> I have 2 embargoed issues

 16:34 <jdstrand> that's it from me, mdeslaur you're up

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I have patch piloting tomorrow

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I just published a graphite2 update

 16:34 <mdeslaur> and I'm working on exim2 updates

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I have a short week too, I'm off thursday afternoon and friday

 16:35 <mdeslaur> that's it from me, sbeattie?

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'm on security bug triage this week

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'm in the middle of spamming the world about kernel USNs

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm also reviewing pie test rebuild failures and preparing packages for sponsoring so that we're ready to land when 16.10 opens

 16:36 <sbeattie> I also need to look at jjohansen and tyhicks apparmor stacking work

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm off next week.

 16:36 <sbeattie> That'll pretty much eat my brain for this. tyhicks, you're up.

 16:37 <sbeattie> s/this/this week/

 16:37 <tyhicks> sbeattie: I think we may ask you to cut an upstream apparmor release tomorrow

 16:37 <tyhicks> sbeattie: jj prefers a new release over me backporting the ns and stacking patches to what's currently in xenial

 16:38 * tyhicks goes

 16:38 <tyhicks> I'm working on AppArmor stacking

 16:38 <sbeattie> tyhicks: okay; fair warning, 2.11 will require some packaging work to handle the binutils/ directory.

 16:39 <tyhicks> sbeattie: ack - thanks for the reminder

 16:39 <tyhicks> I have a few more things that I want to write tests for

 16:39 <tyhicks> I also have a few small parser fixups to write

 16:40 <tyhicks> I still haven't gotten to my pending eCryptfs work

 16:40 <tyhicks> maybe that can happen towards the end of the week

 16:40 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:40 <tyhicks> jj isn't attending the meeting today but he's focused on AppArmor stacking

 16:40 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:40 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week; it's a short week for me, I'm off monday.

 16:41 <tyhicks> today?

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm working on MIRs, I hope to finish the fwupd package today or tomorrow, then the golang-websocket

 16:41 <sarnold> wow

 16:41 <sarnold> off friday :)

 16:41 <tyhicks> :)

 16:41 <sarnold> though if that's how my brain's going to run today, maybe today'd be smarted. sheesh.

 16:41 <sbeattie> time change makes every day feel like monday

 16:42 <sarnold> lets blame day light saving

 16:42 * sarnold ^5 sbeattie

 16:42 <sarnold> "smarted".

 16:42 <sarnold> I'd like to help do apparmor reviews too, but we'll see.

 16:42 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> I'm still expecting to sponsor a Chromium update this week, and I'm also awaiting a Thunderbird update (not sure if that will happen this week)

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> But no other updates planned, so I should be able to crack on with my list of convergence fixes (unless bug 1550371 ends up back with me)

 16:45 <ubottu> bug 1550371 in Canonical System Image "Webbrowser slow scroll and artifact rendering on freiza" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1550371

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> That's me done

 16:45 <tyhicks> thanks
