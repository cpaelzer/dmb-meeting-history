 16:38 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:38 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: go ahead (we'll circle back to Jamie since he's in the middle of another conversation)

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage

 16:39 <mdeslaur> but i'm only here today, I'm off for the holidays starting tomorrow

 16:39 <tyhicks> ratliff will take over triage after today

 16:39 <tyhicks> cve triage, that is

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on embargoed issues

 16:39 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 16:39 <tyhicks> sbeattie: you're up

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:39 <sbeattie> it's a short week for me, I'm off thursday and friday

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'll try to pick up an update this week, possibly one or more of the embargoed issue mdeslaur is working on

 16:41 <sbeattie> I have some apparmor work to do to get the release out

 16:41 <tyhicks> do you plan on getting the release out before you go on vacation?

 16:41 <sbeattie> I also have some misc kernel triage/tasks to look after.

 16:42 <sbeattie> tyhicks: I'll be back next week (for another short week)

 16:42 <tyhicks> oh

 16:42 <tyhicks> ok

 16:42 <sbeattie> but yes, planning to get the release out before the holidays

 16:42 <sbeattie> anyway, that'll likely consume my week.

 16:42 <sbeattie> tyhicks: on to you

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm going to be taking over bug triage this week

 16:44 <tyhicks> I'm going to be verifying the trusty dbus and apparmor SRUs (LP: #1641243)

 16:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1641243 in apparmor (Ubuntu Trusty) "Provide full AppArmor confinement for snaps on 14.04" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1641243

 16:44 <tyhicks> I hope to finish up the seccomp logging changes - I think I only need to finish adding tests to libseccomp

 16:45 <tyhicks> however, the kernel merge window just opened up so the kernel changes aren't likely to land until the next kernel

 16:45 <tyhicks> I am going to publish some embargoed issues that mdeslaur and others are working on

 16:45 <tyhicks> I have some sprint prep to do

 16:46 <tyhicks> and I still have a number of ecryptfs issues on my plate (haven't been able to work on them at all)

 16:46 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:46 <tyhicks> I don't see jj

 16:46 <tyhicks> sarnold_: go ahead

 16:46 <sarnold_> I'm on community this week

 16:47 <sarnold_> I seem to recall seeing some sponsored updates from last week, and I'm not sure what state my schroots or vms are in, so it' spossible much of this week will be yak shaving to do the updates

 16:47 <sarnold_> with what time is left I'll head on to swift-s3-something-mumble MIR

 16:48 <tyhicks> I got through all of the sponsorings (d2u and debdiff) last week

 16:48 <sarnold_> libav too?

 16:48 <sarnold_> or was that ffmpeg?

 16:48 <tyhicks> didn't see that one, so I guess I didn't get through them all

 16:48 <ratliff> ffmpeg

 16:49 <sarnold_> that's me done, jjohansen?

 16:49 <jjohansen> yep

 16:50 <jjohansen> Its a short week for me again, I friday off

 16:50 <jjohansen> I am following up with a couple of bugs that got fixed last week

 16:50 <jjohansen> I still need to look into the mount issue, that jdstrand encountered

 16:51 <jjohansen> and I need to work on gsettings

 16:51 <tyhicks> by following up, you mean SRU verification?

 16:52 <jjohansen> tyhicks: well, bugging people to ensure the patches worked for them, and sending them up to the kt

 16:52 <tyhicks> jjohansen: ^

 16:52 <tyhicks> ah

 16:52 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:53 <jjohansen> thats it for /me back to you tyhicks

 16:54 <tyhicks> ratliff: you're up

 16:54 <ratliff> I'm on bug triage today, CVE triage after today.

 16:55 <ratliff> I have some reviews pending to complete and I need to prepare the zesty ghostscript debdiff.

 16:55 <ratliff> back to you tyhicks

 16:56 <tyhicks> jdstrand: go ahead

 16:56 <jdstrand> finialize dbus PR

 16:56 <jdstrand> finalize network-namespace-control PR

 16:56 <jdstrand> various PR reviews

 16:56 <jdstrand> various snappy personal reviews/design discussions

 16:56 <jdstrand> start working on seccomp arg filtering

 16:56 <jdstrand> last week I actually got to work on a few things, so I think dbus and network-namespace PRs may land soon

 16:57 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:57 <tyhicks> thanks jdstrand
