 20:01 <marcoceppi> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2000 UTC meeting for March 3, 2016.

 20:01 <marcoceppi> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:01 <marcoceppi> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:01 <marcoceppi> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:01 <marcoceppi> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:01 <marcoceppi> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:01 <marcoceppi> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers amounts to at least +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 20:01 <marcoceppi> #votesrequired 4

 20:01 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed
