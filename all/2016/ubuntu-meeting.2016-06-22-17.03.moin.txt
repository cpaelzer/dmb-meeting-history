 17:04 <beisner> o/

 17:04 <jamespage> not sure on the other - lets wait and see

 17:04 <jamespage> anyway moving on

 17:04 <jamespage> #topic State of Development for next Charm Release

 17:05 <gnuoy> jamespage, sorry, yes. I still need to do both those actions

 17:05 <jamespage> ok so things are still moving forward; we have alot of momentum on the new layered charms atm so I'd like to target getting all layers, interfaces and new charms under git/gerrit by the end of next week

 17:05 <jamespage> #action gnuoy to update testing for multi-release upgrade testing

 17:05 * meetingology gnuoy to update testing for multi-release upgrade testing

 17:05 <gnuoy> SSL is almost ready ;land into the layers

 17:05 <gnuoy> eg Yuor layered charm will soon get SSL support for free!

 17:06 <jamespage> I think that includes charm-aodh, charm-designate, charm-barbican + subordinate + the designate-dns charm as well

 17:06 <gnuoy> yep

 17:06 <gnuoy> Documentation has been updated on enabling HA in layered charms hasn't it? or am I imagining that?

 17:06 <jamespage> also charms from icey and cholcombe: layered ceph-mon should be inbound - do you guys have other layers or interfaces we need to start mvoing?

 17:07 <jamespage> gnuoy, not yet

 17:07 <gnuoy> ok, np

 17:07 <jamespage> gnuoy, I'll do that after we move the guide - just raised the review for that

 17:07 <gnuoy> kk

 17:07 <jamespage> charms.openstack also needs to move over...

 17:07 <jamespage> anything else from anyone on development?

 17:07 <gnuoy> not from me

 17:08 <jamespage> coreycb, we need to get your dfs stuff landed - and the sriov support is also on my review list; then thedac's dnsha stuff

 17:08 <icey> ceph-base will be landing with ceph-mon hopefully

 17:08 <jamespage> busy day tomorrow methings

 17:08 <coreycb> jamespage, yes please thanks

 17:08 <icey> jamespage:  ^

 17:08 <coreycb> jamespage, I hope to have the rest of DFS systemd init on the way soon

 17:09 <jamespage> icey, ok - but I'm going to need you to drive the project-config changes for any new repositories - beisner and I have done most to date but we all need to know how!

 17:09 <icey> ack jamespage

 17:09 <jamespage> #topic Release Bugs

 17:09 <jamespage> #link https://goo.gl/HJjORI

 17:10 <jamespage> think we could all do with some regular triage time

 17:10 * jamespage tables a motion

 17:10 <jamespage> how about a triage rota? commitment is two hours of triage on your allocated day?

 17:10 <gnuoy> +1

 17:10 <jamespage> that's what we're doing for pkgs now

 17:10 <jamespage> gnuoy, ok I'll work something up

 17:11 <gnuoy> I hate to say it but I think we should track that it's actually happening too

 17:11 <jamespage> #action jamespage to create a new triage rota and chase down participants

 17:11 * meetingology jamespage to create a new triage rota and chase down participants

 17:11 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 17:11 <jamespage> okies - anything else from anyone?

 17:11 <coreycb> jamespage, any update on licensing?

 17:11 <jamespage> coreycb, yes!

 17:11 <jamespage> proceeding on repos where we can:

 17:11 <jamespage> https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:apache-license

 17:11 <jamespage> some easy +2's for landing if folk have cycles

 17:12 * beisner updated 2 of those bugs as fix-released.  boom.

 17:12 <jamespage> I think I have three non-responders  - I'll chase again

 17:12 <jamespage> bdx is one of them :-)

 17:12 <gnuoy> 16.07 is creeping up, keep that in mind!

 17:12 <coreycb> jamespage, nice, getting there

 17:12 <jamespage> and then impact assess - it maybe that we have to exclude some repositories

 17:12 <jamespage> gnuoy, yah - so I think we have 3.2 weeks left of feature work (to mid July) and then freeze, test release right?

 17:13 <gnuoy> yeah

 17:13 <jamespage> okies - lets pick a date for freeze

 17:13 <jamespage> 14th July

 17:13 <gnuoy> have done

 17:13 <jamespage> ?

 17:13 <gnuoy> it's in the minutes

 17:13 * gnuoy can't remember

 17:14 <jamespage> ok np

 17:14 <jamespage> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 17:14 <jamespage> +7 days, 1700 UTC

 17:14 <jamespage> #endmeeting
