 16:01 * jgrimm-vac lurks

 16:01 <matsubara> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <matsubara> I found only two actions from last week's meeting.

 16:02 * matsubara jgrimm to update/clean up blueprint

 16:02 * matsubara smb to clarify if kernel team handles kerneloops package

 16:03 <matsubara> I also take the opportunity to thank jgrimm-vac for running last week's meeting. It was my turn but I got disconnected by ISP

 16:03 <jgrimm-vac> no worries!

 16:03 <jgrimm-vac> i've made some cleanups in the blueprint, but keep it as action for me

 16:04 <matsubara> Ok, thanks

 16:04 <matsubara> #action: jgrimm to update/clean up blueprint

 16:04 * meetingology : jgrimm to update/clean up blueprint

 16:04 <matsubara> smb, hi there, just in time. We had an action for you from last week's meeting.

 16:04 * matsubara smb to clarify if kernel team handles kerneloops package

 16:05 <smb> matsubara, so while not clear its synced now

 16:05 <matsubara> smb, great. thanks!

 16:05 <matsubara> so, no more actions, let's move on

 16:05 <matsubara> #topic Xenial Development

 16:05 <matsubara> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:06 <matsubara> Docstring freeze this week and next week final beta freeze

 16:06 <matsubara> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:06 <matsubara> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:08 <matsubara> ok, we have a couple of bugs there in new state

 16:08 <matsubara> one is high

 16:08 <matsubara> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1508874

 16:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1508874 in nova-lxd (Ubuntu Xenial) "Please disable cpu resource configuration" [High,New]

 16:08 <matsubara> but that's likely to be under the openstack team turf

 16:09 <matsubara> and a new one for the lxc team which has been triaged as medium: http://launchpad.net/bugs/1533833

 16:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1533833 in lxc (Ubuntu Wily) "unprivileged lxc containers won't start, need to put sessions into "pids" cgroup controller" [Medium,New]

 16:09 <matsubara> looks like everything is under control there.

 16:09 <matsubara> let's move on

 16:09 <matsubara> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:10 <caribou> matsubara: nothing particular to bring up

 16:11 <matsubara> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)
