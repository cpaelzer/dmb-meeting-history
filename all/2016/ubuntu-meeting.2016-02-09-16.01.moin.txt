 16:01 <jgrimm> who all is here?  hi smoser and teward!

 16:02 <jgrimm> lots of folks on vacation this week: matsubara, kickinz1, cpaelzer, rbasak .. so this may be light turn out

 16:02 <teward> if it's only us three, then heh.

 16:02 <arges> i'm here!

 16:02 <teward> ah, that explains why rbasak didn't reply to my email heh

 16:02 <teward> s/email/message previously/

 16:02 <jgrimm> arges, its almost like you are right behind me

 16:03 <jgrimm> all right, might as well begin

 16:03 <arges> haha

 16:03 <jgrimm> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:03 * jgrimm looks at last notes

 16:04 <jgrimm> no ACTION points. moving on.

 16:04 <jgrimm> #topic Xenial Development

 16:04 <teward> nginx 1.9.10-0ubuntu1 landed in Xenial on the 27th

 16:04 <teward> with a merge from Debian coming shortly after that to catch a few fixes that they did to packaging

 16:05 <teward> and there's a pending task for me for Xenial, getting today's nginx release in before FeatureFreeze

 16:05 <smoser> good job, teward

 16:05 <jgrimm> teward, great. thanks for dutifully staying on top of nginx.

 16:05 <teward> I'm waiting to hear from Debian how they want to approach dynamic modules now being available, first, before working on 1.9.11

 16:05 <teward> as that may influence the way that package works in the future

 16:05 <teward> </done>

 16:06 <smoser> for those playing along at home, Feature Freeze is Feb 18.

 16:06 <smoser> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:06 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:06 <smoser> that is not this thursday but next.

 16:07 <jgrimm> indeed, timing quickly running out.

 16:08 <jgrimm> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-x-server-core

 16:09 <teward> jgrimm: and i missed your thank you.  You're welcome, it's my pleasure to keep on top of nginx :)

 16:09 <jgrimm> section 16.02 has lots of the 'big' things people are working on

 16:09 <jgrimm> one to may be make people more aware of is php 7

 16:10 <jgrimm> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5/+bug/1522422

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1522422 in php5 (Ubuntu) "Update to php 7.0" [Wishlist,Triaged]

 16:11 <jgrimm> Its a long read.  Contact nacc if you are interested in helping test.

 16:12 <jgrimm> The plan of record is to fully transition to php7 for 16.04.  Aggressive goal, but looking pretty good so far.

 16:12 <jgrimm> Anyone have any questions about the blueprint?  I can try to relay what I know at least.

 16:12 <jgrimm> arges, how goes libvirt? I haven't caught up with you lately

 16:13 <arges> jgrimm: So smb has been working on libvirt

 16:13 <arges> and i'm going to review v5 today, its passing qa-regression-tests and seems to be almost there

 16:14 <jgrimm> \o/ great

 16:14 <jgrimm> thanks arges and smb

 16:15 <jgrimm> anything else from folks wrt Xenial dev?

 16:15 <arges> smoser: bug 1543025 would be useful to fix btw (if you haven't already seen it)

 16:15 <teward> just in regards to that blueprint - i moved one of the nginx tasks from 16.03 to 16.04, to match

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1543025 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Xenial) "Wrong UTC zoneinfo in cloud-images" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1543025

 16:15 <arges> it was biting us doing the autopkgtests for libvirt

 16:15 <jgrimm> thanks teward

 16:15 <teward> s/to match/to match nginx upstream's release schedule for 1.10.x*

 16:15 <caribou> jgrimm: I'm on clamav : got a merge which builds

 16:15 <jgrimm> caribou, thanks. and thanks for helping review merge of ntpd

 16:15 <caribou> jgrimm: np

 16:16 <jgrimm> any one else?

 16:18 <jgrimm> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:19 <jgrimm> well, rbasak is out this week, but he did want to call out that we've been building up technical debt around bug triage and bug fixing

 16:20 <jgrimm> intentional on our part to focus on FF, but just a reminder that there's still lots of work on bugs that are building up as we focus on xenial

 16:20 <jgrimm> anyone else have bugs they want to talk about?

 16:20 <jgrimm> moving on

 16:20 <arges> bugs... what are those?

 16:21 <caribou> as said before, working on merges & a few other things around kdump-tools

 16:22 <caribou> that's it
