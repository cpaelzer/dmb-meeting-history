 15:13 <slangasek> heh

 15:13 <pitti> sil2100: you mentioned arm64 -- any news wrt. autopgkgtest requirements/hw ?

 15:14 <slangasek> pitti: fwiw I've escalated that to Beret

 15:14 <sil2100> pitti: no news, jibel is all aware, but I guess there still needs to be this discussion who should own the HW

 15:16 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:16 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:16 <cyphermox> my desktop looks all funky, because I have yet to reboot after updating gtk?

 15:16 <pitti> doesn't look significantly less funky after rebooting, though ;)

 15:16 <caribou> cyphermox: for some reason I lost the sound indicator on mine

 15:16 <cyphermox> heh

 15:17 <sil2100> I'm on holidays starting the 5th, two weeks from then

 15:17 <pitti> (well, </trolling>)

 15:17 <cyphermox> pitti: good to know, I'll postpone rebooting then

 15:17 <pitti> cyphermox: really j/k, should be fine

 15:17 <cyphermox> what I mean by funky is that I have just about no widgets showing up correctly

 15:17 <xnox> cyphermox, logout/login helps. but i guess that's pretty much reboot.

 15:17 <cyphermox> xnox: yeah, that's equivalent :)

 15:17 <xnox> $ restart unity7

 15:18 * xnox ...and pray

 15:18 <cyphermox> meh

 15:18 <cyphermox> eventually I'll have fewer terminals open

 15:18 <cyphermox> ... or a wish to let my office get cold again

 15:19 <slangasek> the real cause of arctic ice melt

 15:20 <cyphermox> it's *server room warm here*

 15:20 <tdaitx> cyphermox, fewer terminals open? entropy does not allow that

 15:21 <slangasek> tdaitx: the third law of terminodynamics?

 15:21 <cyphermox> yep

 15:22 * infinity has to be rude and run off to the bathroom in the middle of the meeting; will read scrollback.

 15:22 <cyphermox> I choose to turn more terminals into a temperature delta eventually

 15:22 <tdaitx> slangasek, second, I have yet to see the number of terminals remaining contant... ;-)

 15:23 <slangasek> :)

 15:23 <slangasek> ok, anything else for real?

 15:24 <barry> infinity: please turn off your mic

 15:25 <infinity> barry: I didn't take my mic to the bathroom.

 15:26 <slangasek> #endmeeting
