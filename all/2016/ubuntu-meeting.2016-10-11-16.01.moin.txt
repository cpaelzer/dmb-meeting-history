 16:01 <jgrimm> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:01 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Oct 11 16:01:24 2016 UTC.  The chair is jgrimm. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:01 <meetingology> 

 16:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:02 <rbasak> o/

 16:02 <jgrimm> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <jgrimm> (jgrimm) clean up rls-x and add back to agenda

 16:02 <jgrimm> done. fixed up wiki and irc cut &paste

 16:02 <jgrimm> (jamespage) checkin with old iscsitarget users on relevancy with new kernels

 16:03 <jgrimm> jamespage, ^^ anything new here ^^

 16:03 <smoser> o/

 16:04 <jgrimm> will leave that one on the agenda for next week update then. ..

 16:04 <jgrimm> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:04 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule

 16:05 <jgrimm> obviously been a busy last several weeks for everyone!

 16:05 <jgrimm> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:05 <jgrimm> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:06 <jgrimm> nothing changed there.

 16:06 <jgrimm> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:06 <caribou> clamav + llvm-3.6 issue is fixed, now available

 16:07 <jgrimm> ah.. thanks for chasing that

 16:07 <caribou> debian has dropped llvm use until upstream supports llvm-3.8

 16:07 <jgrimm> interesting

 16:07 <caribou> so we may elect to do the same for Z & drop llvm-3.6

 16:07 <jgrimm> that  sounds very reasonable

 16:08 <caribou> support for 3.8 might come in before we release Z

 16:08 <caribou> nothing else for me

 16:08 <jgrimm> either is fine.

 16:08 <jgrimm> thanks caribou

 16:09 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:09 <powersj> Final (?) ISO testing for yakkety. All yakkety ISOs are back below the 703Mb limit! Have some final things to close on there with the fonts-android package re: bug 1626245

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1626245 in fonts-android (Ubuntu) "[MIR] fonts-android" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1626245

 16:09 <powersj> Need to complete yakkety ppc64el ISO testing. nacc: if you have your CLI history to speed this up, that would be great. I want to automate these architectures for the next release.

 16:09 <powersj> ppc64el slave is back up and running. Not sure what happened, but slave was not in a happy state starting on Thursday. I will be updating it and other slaves today.

 16:09 <powersj> Today, ppc64el setup for qemu/libvirt migration testing; rest of the week will be on cloud-init integration testing. Fin.

 16:09 <jgrimm> excellent.

 16:09 <jgrimm> any questions for powersj?

 16:10 <jgrimm> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:10 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:10 <rharper> o/

 16:11 <jgrimm> anyone from kernel team around?

 16:11 <jgrimm> moving on

 16:11 <jgrimm> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:12 <jgrimm> FOSDEM CFP deadline end of month

 16:12 <jgrimm> anything else?

 16:12 <jgrimm> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:13 <jgrimm> cpaelzer has a DPDK summit soon.

 16:14 <jgrimm> and of course openstack summit

 16:14 <jgrimm> anything else?

 16:14 <jgrimm> #topic Open Discussion

 16:15 <rharper> I saw rbasak poke about release notes; but wasn't sure if we were coordinating things with other teams, like foundation;

 16:16 <rharper> I'm specifically thinking about netplan, systemd, cloud-init and other things that have been shifting aroudn

 16:16 <rbasak> We should coordinate that in #ubuntu-release

 16:17 <rharper> ok, but within our team did we maybe collect volunteers or have jgrimm volunteer us to write something up about our various items

 16:17 <rharper> thinking any updates to the packages we do; dpdk, qemu/libvirt, uvt-kvm (\o/) ;

 16:17 <cpaelzer> I already added a section for ovs-dpdk

 16:17 <nacc> powersj: yeah, i'll ping you after the mtg?

 16:17 <cpaelzer> dpdk changes don't qualify

 16:17 <jgrimm> rharper, indeed, last couple times i've had someone come ask me for the package updates and anything else we think worth mentioning

 16:18 <rharper> the wiki page looks rather sparse under Ubuntu Server, I suppose it shouldn't be that empty

 16:18 <powersj> nacc, please

 16:18 <rharper> ok

 16:18 <cpaelzer> we can at least add the generic got updated see changelog for qemu/libvirt/dpdk

 16:19 <cpaelzer> I'd volunteer writing dpdk/qemu/libvirt

 16:19 <jgrimm> thanks cpaelzer

 16:19 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: would you start a gdoc where we all put our stuff in?

 16:19 <cpaelzer> and share with the team

 16:19 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, yep.

 16:20 <jgrimm> LXD will have an update, as well as, cloud-init

 16:20 <cpaelzer> rharper: and smoser: can already start poking for the "shifting around things" today for the who-writes-what

 16:21 <jgrimm> ok, anything else to discuss on this subject?

 16:21 <rharper> I'm happy to write some stuff; I think we need a short list of topics worth mentioning

 16:21 <rharper> jgrimm: I'm good

 16:21 <rbasak> uvt-kvm> no actual updates for Yakkety, since it was post-FF. The PPA has some updates, and I'll upload them in Z.

 16:21 <jgrimm> cool, tx

 16:22 <jgrimm> #topic Assigned merges/bugwork (rbasak)

 16:22 <rbasak> I thought we moved this topic back into Yakkety development? I have no comments, please continue self-serve! Any questions?

 16:22 <rbasak> We are in final freeze now, so expect no uploads until Z I guess.

 16:23 <rbasak> And it'll soon be merge time again, from next week.

 16:23 <smoser> Z horay!

 16:23 <jgrimm> yep

 16:23 <jgrimm> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:23 * nacc plans on an e-mail to the team for rebasing merges by EOW

 16:23 <jgrimm> nacc, ack

 16:24 <jgrimm> same time & channel.  next up powersj

 16:24 <powersj> oooo

 16:24 <powersj> something else to learn :)

 16:24 <cpaelzer> it is just the check if you can copy and paste :-P

 16:24 <jgrimm> heh. its not too painful.

 16:25 <jgrimm> #endmeeting
