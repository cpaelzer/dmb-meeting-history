 15:03 <tdaitx> = OpenJDK security update

 15:03 <tdaitx> - Provided OpenJDK 7 packages for Trusty and Precise to the security team; JamVM fix; disabled PCH on arm64/Trusty to avoid segfault (tks for the tip doko!)

 15:03 <tdaitx> - Retested LP: #913434 on OpenJDK 6/7/8; does not affect 6 and 8, affects 7 released earlier than 2.6.6 (thus fixed by 2.6.7 without the need to use the embedded LCMS);

 15:03 <tdaitx> - JamVM working on OpenJDK 8

 15:03 <tdaitx> = Other

 15:03 <tdaitx> - Looked over a few openjdk errors in errors.u.c that have more reports than LP: #1609190; a few might be worth a deeper look and a fix, if reproducible

 15:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1609190 in openjdk-8 (Ubuntu) "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-armhf/jre/bin/java:6:BytecodeInterpreter::run:CppInterpreter::main_loop:CppInterpreter::normal_entry:ZeroEntry::invoke:Interpreter::invoke_method" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1609190
