 22:01 <marcoceppi> #startmeeting 2200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 22:01 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Feb  4 22:01:04 2016 UTC.  The chair is marcoceppi. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:01 <marcoceppi> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for February 4, 2016.

 22:01 <marcoceppi> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:01 <marcoceppi> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:01 <marcoceppi> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:01 <marcoceppi> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:01 <marcoceppi> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:01 <marcoceppi> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers amounts to at least +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:02 <marcoceppi> Since there's only one applicant this should be a straight forward process

 22:02 <marcoceppi> #votesrequired 4

 22:02 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed

 22:03 <wxl> did we miss anyone else?

 22:03 <marcoceppi> Wow that was a terrible paste job, sorry everyone

 22:04 <Kilos> one short

 22:04 <Kilos> postpone till next year

 22:04 <wxl> yes we do

 22:04 <cyphermox> err, not sure I should still be in the voters list

 22:05 <wxl> i also heard from hggdh on irc (his vote), but he also said he'd be here

 22:05 <teward> I was going to say there's a potential Conflict of INterest with regards to wxl voting, but he's cleared it up, obviously he knows to preempt my questions xD

 22:05 <tsimonq2> :)

 22:05 <wxl> that conflict of interest being that i've worked directly with tsimonq2 and mentored him quite a bit

 22:05 <wxl> for the record

 22:05 <teward> yep

 22:05 <marcoceppi> Okay, so

 22:05 <teward> i wasn't going to voice them, i was going to eat them

 22:05 <marcoceppi> Now, without any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:06 <marcoceppi> #subtopic tsimonq2

 22:06 <marcoceppi> #topic tsimonq2

 22:06 <tsimonq2> (let me know when to jump in :) )

 22:06 <marcoceppi> tsimonq2: please introduce yourself and supply us links to your application/wiki and lp!

 22:06 * wxl hands the microphone to tsimonq2

 22:06 <tsimonq2> Wiki Page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tsimonq2 , Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~tsimonq2 , Ubuntu US Wisconsin LoCo Team Wiki Page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WisconsinTeam

 22:06 <tsimonq2> My name is Simon Quigley (tsimonq2) and I am from Wisconsin, USA. I am currently 13 years old(I turn 14 in March of 2016). I have been interested in computers for the past few years, and I started using Ubuntu in February 2015. My contributions started in late July after asking a question on a Lubuntu IRC channel and meeting friendly people. My forms of contribution include but are not limited to: Package and ISO QA, Ubuntu Weekly

 22:06 <tsimonq2> I hope you look favorably upon my application for Ubuntu Membership. If you have any questions/comments/concerns please let me know. Thank you.

 22:07 * teward raises his hand.

 22:07 <teward> hindsight demands me to revise my testimonial slightly

 22:07 <teward> or rather, to clarify it slightly

 22:08 <teward> last-minute due to time constraints on my schedule prevented this statement.  I acknowledge tsimonq2's contributions are exceptionally substantial, and that I am not making statements to the contrary.  He has also shown substantial improvement in his professionalism.

 22:09 <Kilos> ty teward

 22:09 <teward> However, missing from my testimonial is that, while extrememly substantial, and 'somewhat' sustained, I would prefer to have seen slightly longer timeframe of contributions.  That said, I keep my testimonial at a +1, on a contingency of him shoing sustained contributions

 22:09 <teward> Kilos: i wasn't 100% complete, sorry

 22:09 <Kilos> np

 22:09 <teward> s/shoing/showing/

 22:09 <teward> (wxl knows this was one of my concerns previously)

 22:10 * wxl nods

 22:10 <jcastro> http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/reports/testers

 22:10 <teward> I did, however, want to make that concern remain known here, with regards to my testimonial.

 22:10 <jcastro> ^^^ that is pretty incredible

 22:10 <tsimonq2> thank you jcastro :P

 22:10 <tsimonq2> s/:P/:)/

 22:11 <marcoceppi> tsimonq2: what are you looking to get into next in the community?

 22:12 <tsimonq2> marcoceppi: development. do you need elaboration on that?

 22:12 * balloons can tell tsimonq2 has been quite busy testing images

 22:12 <marcoceppi> tsimonq2: development, like apps, phone, snaps? or just in general

 22:12 <tsimonq2> marcoceppi: I also plan on continuing existing contributions

 22:12 <tsimonq2> marcoceppi: looking at becoming a Contributing Developer

 22:13 <tsimonq2> although I am curious about snaps/Ubuntu Touch as well

 22:13 <marcoceppi> they are pretty neat, imo

 22:13 <tsimonq2> marcoceppi: maybe you can teach me XD

 22:13 <marcoceppi> :)

 22:14 <marcoceppi> any other questions for tsimonq2?

 22:14 * teward has one

 22:14 <teward> though i'm not on the MB

 22:15 <marcoceppi> feel free to ask

 22:15 <elacheche_anis> No questions here :) teward go ahead :)

 22:15 <teward> tsimonq2: you state that you're looking into getting into development.  A lot of development also involves bug work and triage, and I know you have some exposure to that in the ISO testing, do you plan on looking even more into bug triage as part of your development endeavors?  And if so, do you intend to look into actively helping with general bug triage as well?

 22:15 <jcastro> no questions from me, I feel like your work pretty much speaks for itself

 22:15 <teward> I only ask, given my exposure to Server Development co-requiring bug work :P

 22:15 <tsimonq2> well I am part of the Bug Squad

 22:15 <tsimonq2> didn't put that in there :)

 22:15 <tsimonq2> teward: but one of my goals is to continue with that, yes

 22:16 <teward> cool, I look forward to seeing you continue to excel there, and to see you continue on with your endeavors.

 22:16 <teward> No other questions from me :)

 22:16 * teward goes back into silent lurking mode

 22:16 <tsimonq2> marcoceppi: not to be pushy or anything, but I just want to make sure this was looked at: https://launchpad.net/~tsimonq2/+participation

 22:16 * elacheche_anis is ready to vote.
