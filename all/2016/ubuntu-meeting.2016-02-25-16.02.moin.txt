 16:06 <xnox> nice.

 16:06 <pitti> cyphermox: what's wrong with networking restart?

 16:06 <cyphermox> apparently, people want to use that

 16:06 <pitti> doko: many thanks for clearing up c-m, it's soo much better to read already

 16:06 <caribou_> pitti: someone is (yet again) asking for it to be fixed

 16:06 <cyphermox> (especially with upstart)

 16:07 <xnox> .... but it "works" with upstart =) as in, restart networking -> does nothing and tells people to go away.

 16:07 <cyphermox> pitti: so I was asked to look into it, and I did and wrote down my notes

 16:07 <xnox> caribou_, interesting. I wonder if we should show them systemd-networkd where all interfaces grow unlimited configuration (things are only added, never removed in networkd)

 16:07 <pitti> xnox: your turn, btw

 16:07 <xnox> ok.

 16:07 <xnox> we were talking =)

 16:07 <xnox> Merge acpid (upon doko's request)

 16:07 <xnox> Uploaded juju patch to make it work with daily streams

 16:07 <xnox> mdadm is now used to assemble ISMS and DDF raids

 16:07 <xnox> bug fix to opencryptoki, missing symlinks to some s390x-tokens

 16:07 <xnox> did review, merge, upload for cloud team of the livecd-rootfs

 16:08 <xnox> did a couple final dh_python2 uploads, and thus doko remove python-support from the archive

 16:08 <caribou_> xnox: and a lot of people are "very" happy about that :)

 16:08 <xnox> Fixed old bugs: bug #1317153

 16:08 <ubottu> bug 1317153 in os-prober (Ubuntu) "os-prober 90fallback - kernels detected out of order" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1317153

 16:08 <xnox> Made qemu backport friendly into the cloud-archive

 16:08 <xnox> Improved sysconfig packaging for MIR

 16:08 <xnox> Fixed libica for MIR, which got rejected, instead of opencryptoki got demoted to universe.

 16:08 <xnox> Staging installer changes for uploads post milestone release

 16:08 <xnox> done.

 16:08 <xnox> caribou_, upstart->does-nothing or the excellent-networkd? Or both?

 16:08 <caribou_> xnox: we're talking trusty

 16:08 <cyphermox> xnox: what installer changes? I'm curious because I have some things pending on my list

 16:09 <barry> xnox, doko python-support \o/

 16:09 <caribou_> I'm also sprinting this week so nothing to report

 16:09 <caribou_> (done)

 16:09 <xnox> cyphermox, bits for s390x e.g. tweks in parted for default filesystem handling to be per disk, and possibly further changes here and there.

 16:10 <barry> Python 3 only: now just the most difficult samba-libs work to do

 16:10 <barry> --done--

 16:10 <xnox> cyphermox, not much. there are debian bugs filed for all of them, and launchpad issues too. I can pass them over to you as well.

 16:10 <pitti> autopkgtest:

 16:10 <pitti> - Debug failure of armhf/s390x testbeds; turns out new lxc completely breaks this; downgraded, bug pending

 16:10 <pitti> - Fix proxy setting in armhf/s390x LXC workers

 16:10 <pitti> - Work around "lxc file push" regression that broke the LXD runner (#1548878)

 16:10 <pitti> - britney: Add force-badtest hint for architectures

 16:10 <cyphermox> xnox: why do you fail to complete on my irc client?

 16:10 <pitti> - britney: Avoid confusing (because often wrong) version numbers for "in progress" tests

 16:10 <pitti> - britney: Introduce a new state for regressions overridden by hints, to make reading and parsing excuses easier

 16:10 <pitti> - britney: Support force-{skip,bad}test hints for multiple versions

 16:10 <pitti> distro:

 16:10 <pitti> - ubiquity: Fix crash when trying to talk to upower (#1547956)

 16:11 <pitti> - moved all remaining main packages to tomcat8, drop tomcat7 from main (#1539903)

 16:11 <pitti> - sponsoring shift on Friday

 16:11 <pitti> ⛇

 16:11 <pitti> ("HEAVY SNOWMAN" in celebration of the weather)

 16:11 <xnox> pitti, are you using LXD on s390x already, or not yet?

 16:11 <pitti> xnox: not yet

 16:11 <xnox> pitti, ok.

 16:11 <pitti> xnox: (1) time issue, (2) no images.linuxcontainers.org images yet

 16:11 <pitti> xnox: I could use the cloud images, but they are a bit of a nuisance

 16:12 <davmor2> pitti: that snowman is goth you can't blag me ;)

 16:12 <doko> barry, I think the samba-libs solution is to find a way to move it off the image and only install it on demand for those who want to install a samba printer

 16:12 <pitti> oh, no sil2100, he excused himself on mail

 16:12 <xnox> pitti, what's nuisance about them? it's trivial for me to tweak things to generate "better" images.

 16:12 <pitti> bdmurray: ?

 16:12 <bdmurray> further work on devops setup of the error tracker

 16:12 <bdmurray> discussions with stub regarding dse cassandra

 16:12 <bdmurray> worked on creating a way to disable LP bug creation in the error tracker

 16:12 <bdmurray> investigation into bind9 crash retracing

 16:12 <pitti> xnox: -> #u-devel

 16:12 <doko> pitti, caused by a bug in grep?

 16:12 <bdmurray> attended meeting re: automated upgrade testing

 16:12 <bdmurray> review of automated upgrade testing work

 16:12 <bdmurray> built / tested new version of ubuntu-release-upgrader for laney (LP: #1548858)

 16:12 <bdmurray> ✔ done

 16:13 <barry> doko: after chatting w/the fedora guy trying to do essentially the same thing, you are probably right

 16:14 <pitti> doko: bug or changed behaviour, not sure

 16:14 <pitti> bdmurray: why do you want to disable bug creation, OOI?

 16:14 <tdaitx> infinity is not around... so here I go

 16:14 <tdaitx> * TCK 7 (Trusty/AMD64)

 16:14 <tdaitx> - Fixed & refactored scripts, updated TCK config files to conform to the new tests

 16:14 <tdaitx> - Fixed run failures/errors

 16:14 <tdaitx> - Rebasing my fixes into proper commits

 16:14 <tdaitx> - Preparing some documentation on how to set it up

 16:14 <tdaitx> Next:

 16:15 <tdaitx> * Setup and run interactive tests locally

 16:15 <tdaitx> * Update scripts and config files to run TCK 8

 16:15 <tdaitx> (done)

 16:16 <xnox> pitti, AOB?

 16:17 <bdmurray> pitti: When we cut over to the new cassandra database there will be some time when the db should be read only. It also makes sense for staging as the created bug would be written to the wrong db.

 16:17 <pitti> #topic AOB

 16:17 <pitti> xnox: sorry, still catching up with reading :)

 16:17 <xnox> So I have two merge proposals, that need someone to review and merge:

 16:17 <xnox> Britney: https://code.launchpad.net/~xnox/britney/deps-components/+merge/286511

 16:18 <xnox> Germinate:

 16:18 <xnox> https://code.launchpad.net/~xnox/germinate/+git/germinate/+merge/285180

 16:18 <pitti> xnox: ah, I didn't merge that yet; TBH I'm a bit uneasy about such complex changes without proper integration test cases

 16:19 <pitti> they are likely to break with merging from trunk (which got quite some refactoring)

 16:19 <xnox> both are trivial python scripts. thus hopefully everyone on our team can review them =)

 16:19 <pitti> I realize that writing tests is some effort as the current "mock" archive doesn't do components yet, so that needs to be added

 16:20 <xnox> pitti, i was not notified of any conflict yet, but i can re-merge. I can certainly write some tests, but the ones that were in, were all about autopkgtest integration which are nice, and don't cover anything else =)

 16:20 <pitti> xnox: I didn't merge with trunk yet

 16:21 <xnox> pitti, ah, ok.

 16:21 <xnox> so can people please try to review and run above codes? we do have germinate users and britney users right?! =)

 16:21 <pitti> I'll review the britney one

 16:22 <pitti> someone else can take germinate?

 16:22 <xnox> barry, ? =)

 16:22 <xnox> barry, it is simple graph processing of the archive in pure python =)

 16:22 <barry> xnox: opening some tabs is all i'll promise right now ;)

 16:23 <barry> xnox: ping me if i don't get to them soon-ish

 16:23 <pitti> ok, anything else from anyone?

 16:24 <pitti> l

 16:25 <pitti> ok, then thanks everyone!

 16:25 <pitti> #endmeeting
