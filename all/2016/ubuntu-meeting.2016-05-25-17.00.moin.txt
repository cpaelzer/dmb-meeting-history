 17:01 <gnuoy> Welcome to the first Openstack Charms meeting !

 17:01 <gnuoy> For those of you haven't seen it there's an agenda etc here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/OpenStackCharmsMeeting

 17:01 <thedac> woo

 17:01 <gnuoy> woo exactly!

 17:01 <gnuoy> Since this is the first one I think it'd be worth doing a few quick introductions. I'm Liam Young, and I work almost exclusively on the OpenStack charms. I'm in UTC+1 and can usually be found in #juju. I'm currently focused on creating a Designate charm among other things.

 17:01 <gnuoy> Who wants to go next?

 17:01 <cargonza> me...

 17:02 <cargonza> I'm Carlos Gonzales and I work with Liam... I manage the Openstack team in Canonical.

 17:02 <thedac> I am David Ames also an OpenstackCharmer. I am in UTC-8. I am currenlty working on HA using DNS for our API charms.

 17:02 <gnuoy> thanks cargonza

 17:02 <gnuoy> ta thedac

 17:03 <tinwood> I'm Alex Kavanagh, I work with Liam and David on OpenStack Charms.  I'm also UTC+1 and can be also found in #juju.  I'm working on the layered barbican charm at present.

 17:03 <gnuoy> ta tinwood

 17:03 <tinwood> np

 17:03 <gnuoy> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 17:03 <gnuoy> Well, since this is the first I think we can safely skip on...

 17:03 <gnuoy> #topic State of Development for next Charm Release

 17:04 <gnuoy> We haven't picked a 16.07 charm release date just yet but I guess we'll be aiming for 2016-07-23 with a freeze on the 9th which looks a lot like two weeks away /o\

 17:04 <gnuoy> We may have to lower expectations for whats in 16.07

 17:04 <cargonza> correct

 17:04 <gnuoy> #action gnuoy review 16.07 deliverables

 17:04 * meetingology gnuoy review 16.07 deliverables

 17:04 <thedac> gnuoy: 9th of June or 9th of July?

 17:05 <gnuoy> thedac, ah ! you can count months better than me!

 17:05 <thedac> Whew!

 17:05 <gnuoy> Make that 1 Month + 2weeks

 17:06 <gnuoy> #topic Release Bugs

 17:06 <gnuoy> #link https://goo.gl/HJjORI

 17:07 <cargonza> those are both Sat. correct? Should we end it on a Friday instead?

 17:07 <gnuoy> Should be a Thursday, I obviously can not operate a calendar

 17:07 <cargonza> in July that is..

 17:07 <gnuoy> #action gnuoy fix release dates

 17:07 * meetingology gnuoy fix release dates

 17:07 <coreycb> o/

 17:08 <gnuoy> Ok so looking at those bugs we have ~35 bugs that have not been touched at all

 17:08 <gnuoy> hey coreycb

 17:08 <gnuoy> That number is a bit high

 17:08 <gnuoy> I'll put sometime aside before the next meeting to look at a few but if anyone has cycles please try and chip a few off.

 17:09 <gnuoy> #action gnuoy Review bug queue

 17:09 * meetingology gnuoy Review bug queue

 17:10 <gnuoy> Anyone want to add anything before we move on?

 17:10 <gnuoy> moving on

 17:10 <gnuoy> #topic Open Discussion

 17:11 <thedac> gnuoy: you want to paste your "How to write a layered openstack charm" doc? I think that would be helpful for people.

 17:11 <gnuoy> Work continues on the openstack reactive layers and interfaces. Important updates to the layers landed today

 17:11 <gnuoy> thedac, there might actually be a link on the minutes wiki

 17:11 <thedac> ah, nice

 17:12 <gnuoy> thedac, it's "Getting involved"

 17:12 <gnuoy> #link https://github.com/openstack-charmers/openstack-community/blob/master/README.dev-charms.md

 17:13 <gnuoy> The plan is to have similiar guides for SDN and storage integration which should be available RSN

 17:13 <gnuoy> I'll move on unless anyone has any more Open things...

 17:14 <gnuoy> #topic Openstack Events

 17:15 <gnuoy> I've heard from jamespage and others that the OPs meetups are excellent. I'd recommend having a look to see if one is happening near you

 17:15 <gnuoy> Other than that I'm not aware of any Openstack'y events before the next ODS

 17:15 <gnuoy> anyone know differently ?

 17:15 <tinwood> What's an OP meetup?

 17:15 <gnuoy> OP <=> Operators

 17:16 <tinwood> ah, okay, thanks.

 17:16 <gnuoy> I think http://www.eventbrite.com/e/european-openstack-operators-meetup-tickets-19405855436 was the one James went to

 17:17 <gnuoy> That is pretty much it for Agenda items etc.

 17:17 <thedac> #link https://github.com/openstack-charmers/openstack-community/blob/master/openstack-api-charm-creation-guide.md

 17:17 <thedac> This was the link I thought was useful ^^

 17:17 <tinwood> There's a whole page of meetings here: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups

 17:17 <gnuoy> Anyone got anthing else they want to mention before we close up?

 17:17 <thedac> I am good

 17:18 <gnuoy> Right then, last but not least...

 17:18 <gnuoy> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 17:18 <gnuoy> Sime time, same place !

 17:18 <gnuoy> The randomely allocated chair for next week is our no-show jamespage !

 17:18 <tinwood> :)

 17:19 <coreycb> thanks gnuoy

 17:19 <gnuoy> And lastly: Apologies to eveyone for my typing & spelling

 17:19 <tinwood> thanks gnuoy

 17:19 <gnuoy> #endmeeting
