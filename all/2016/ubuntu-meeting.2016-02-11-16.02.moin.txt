 16:15 <slangasek> great!

 16:15 <slangasek> any questions?

 16:16 <cyphermox> ah, yes

 16:16 <cyphermox> bdmurray: do we have a way to test upgrades with ubuntu-release-upgrader before we have a new release?

 16:17 <cyphermox> I might want to better test the upgrade from CC.ports.ubuntu.com

 16:17 <pitti> cyphermox: wasn't that what the -d option is for?

 16:17 <cyphermox> (as things will try to match mirrors and stuff)

 16:17 <cyphermox> pitti: upgrade from xenial to xenial+x

 16:18 <slangasek> xxenial

 16:18 <bdmurray> cyphermox: There are some manual ways to test new versions.

 16:18 <cyphermox> since this change won't be in before xenial

 16:18 <cyphermox> bdmurray: ok

 16:18 <bdmurray> xenial+x?

 16:18 <cyphermox> xenial+n if you prefer

 16:18 <slangasek> xennial

 16:18 <infinity> xennial!

 16:19 <bdmurray> heh

 16:19 <cyphermox> sigh.

 16:19 <cyphermox> xenial + # then?

 16:19 <pitti> cyphermox: why does it need to be u-r-u specifically?

 16:19 <slangasek> cyphermox: why you have to take away our fun ;(

 16:19 <infinity> #xenial #omg #nofilter

 16:19 <cyphermox> u-r-u does some magic with mirrors

 16:19 <cyphermox> ie. checking if it's official and such

 16:19 <pitti> upgrade logic ought to be in postinsts as much as possible

 16:20 <cyphermox> I suppose something else might do that too

 16:20 <pitti> as a lot of people use apt directly

 16:20 <cyphermox> I don't see why apt would fail at all

 16:20 <cyphermox> this is simply about changing apt/sources.list

 16:20 <infinity> pitti: Yeah, he's not talking about upgrades, per se, but u-r-u's weird mirror-handling.

 16:20 <pitti> oh, ok (I didn't get *what* you wanted to test exactly)

 16:20 <cyphermox> infinity: I knew there was something to do with #

 16:21 <pitti> why would the mirror handling be any different from t→ x than x→ y?

 16:21 <infinity> pitti: Due to adding support for cc.ports (where previously, it was just ports)

 16:21 <infinity> But this should be easily testable.

 16:21 <slangasek> pitti: what he's asking for is testing an upgrade using the new version of u-r-u

 16:21 <infinity> And, honestly, I've been using us.ports for ages, and u-r-u has never exploded.

 16:21 <pitti> I mean, cc.pots would also mirror trusty, or not?

 16:22 <cyphermox> pitti: I have added $CC.ports.ubuntu.com, which might confuse u-r-u a tiny bit thinking it's not a blessed mirror

 16:22 <cyphermox> pitti: sorry,

 16:22 <cyphermox> pitti: added in choose-mirror, so it only will start to get used for xenial installs

 16:22 <pitti> ah

 16:22 <slangasek> right, so if infinity says it already works, maybe just hand-modify your trusty sources.list and test, cyphermox ?

 16:22 <cyphermox> oh, good point.

 16:23 <infinity> Well, "works".  I think that, right now, u-r-u believes that us.ports is a non-blessed mirror, but keeps it for lack of other mirrors in your sources.list

 16:23 <cyphermox> ok

 16:23 <infinity> It probably needs to be taught that it's official.

 16:23 <infinity> So, yes, needs some testing.

 16:23 <cyphermox> yeah I think that more or less matches what I understood of u-r-u code for this

 16:24 <cyphermox> that's all I had really

 16:24 <bdmurray> u-r-u checks the LP official mirrors

 16:24 <bdmurray> oh and has some hard coded bits like ports.ubuntu.com and old-releases.ubuntu.com

 16:25 <bdmurray> see data/mirrors.cfg

 16:25 <cyphermox> yeah, but it didn't seem to matter

 16:25 <bdmurray> it meaning what?

 16:25 <infinity> The LP mirror list doesn't include all variations of CC.archive, so maybe this has always been a latent misfeature.

 16:26 <cyphermox> fwiw my usual victim, ca.*.u.c wasn't in the list, so I expect things to work, I just want to be *sure*

 16:27 <cyphermox> AOB?

 16:27 <slangasek> other things

 16:27 <slangasek> next Monday is a holiday in the US

 16:27 <slangasek> not sure if people are taking it or not?

 16:27 <infinity> Here too.

 16:27 <slangasek> (I am)

 16:27 <cyphermox> oh, is it?

 16:27 <barry> i am too

 16:27 <infinity> I'm swapping mine, because sprint.

 16:27 <slangasek> infinity: you celebrate Presidents' Day?

 16:27 <infinity> slangasek: No, "Family Day".

 16:28 <bdmurray> I am taking it.

 16:28 <cyphermox> ah, not a holiday in Quebec

 16:28 <slangasek> infinity: why is your Family Day different than BC's?

 16:29 <infinity> cyphermox: Yeah, but QC gets enough weird holidays. :P

 16:29 <slangasek> estranged family?

 16:29 <cyphermox> infinity: we don't care about families here, apparently?

 16:29 <infinity> slangasek: Because BC is weird, it's the 15th for 6/10 provinces, the 8th for BC, and nothing for the other 3.

 16:29 <infinity> slangasek: IMO, they're wrong, since it was Alberta that started it. :P

 16:30 <slangasek> infinity: no, it's the 15th for only 4/10 provinces; Manitoba celebrates Louis Riel Day and PEI celebrates Islander Day, wikipedia tells me!

 16:30 <infinity> slangasek: Well, yes, but same day!

 16:30 <cyphermox> ah, Louis Riel day..

 16:30 <infinity> Heritage Day somewhere too.

 16:30 * bdmurray ponders breakfast

 16:30 <infinity> NS?

 16:30 <cyphermox> yup

 16:30 <slangasek> so parts of Canada and the US, off on Monday :)

 16:31 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:31 <doko> infinity, any estimate on glibc for xenial, or can you point to a ppa?

 16:32 <infinity> doko: My PPA has bits with all the upstream code changes, remaining packaging changes should follow Very Soon.
