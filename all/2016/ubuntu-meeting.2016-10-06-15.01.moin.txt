 15:06 <bdmurray> foundations, iso-testing bug triage

 15:06 <sil2100> caribou: yeah, from what people said this fix didn't really work though, will try another one from the proposals in the upstream bug

 15:06 <bdmurray> unattended-upgrades bug triage

 15:06 <bdmurray> ✔ done

 15:06 <caribou> sil2100: ok, keeping an eye on it

 15:06 <sil2100> - RTM status meetings

 15:06 <sil2100> - xenial arm64: * Reviewing all xenial touch systemd merge requests * Prepare and test lxc-android-config silo with all changes * Poke about upstart getting released * Filling in RT for an arm64 scalingstack node for the custom tarball jenkins * Importing first arm64 frieza custom tarball * Building and importing first systemd enabled touch rootfs image

 15:06 <sil2100> - Look into the s390x pyzmq unit test failure, attempt building a workaround

 15:06 <slangasek> caribou: why are you using llvm-toolchain-3.6 instead of llvm-toolchain-3.8?  (I think I saw this question asked on #ubuntu-devel the other day...)

 15:07 <pitti> sil2100: did I read "emulator"?

 15:07 <caribou> slangasek: higher than 3.6 requires sensible modification of the package & debian is not done yet

 15:07 <sil2100> pitti: yeah, the ubuntu-emulator images ;)

 15:07 <pitti> sil2100: *\o/* !

 15:08 <caribou> slangasek: https://www.mail-archive.com/pkg-clamav-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org/msg04458.html

 15:09 <slangasek> doko_, xnox: could one of you help caribou with his clamav vs. llvm problem, so we can un-stick this for release?

 15:09 <xnox> ok.

 15:10 <caribou> slangasek: right now, debian has the same problem as they are transitioning to llvm-3.8 and clamav no longer builds there either

 15:11 <slangasek> * releasey stuff - lots of queue reviews and update_excuses prodding

 15:11 <slangasek> * finished landing unity8 session on the desktop ISO \o/

 15:11 <slangasek> * fixed a few unaligned access SIGBUSes on armhf, exposed by the change to launchpad builder config; these cause previously-working packages to FTBFS and sometimes now fail autopkgtests (python-xmp-toolkit) and are reproducible on porter-arm64 but not porter-armhf

 15:14 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:15 <slangasek> cyphermox: so on the shim revert... best idea I can think of is to rescue the MokManager binary from the original 0.8 package and pass it through.  We still have all the source for it, we just wouldn't use the one we're building because $reasons

 15:15 <cyphermox> slangasek: that was my plan too

 15:15 <cyphermox> no other way about it anyway

 15:15 <cyphermox> just *omg it's still borken*

 15:20 <barry> btw, it works great (modulo hopefully a minor issue) - thanks pitti!  so much better than travis+docker

 15:21 <pitti> robru: haven't forgotten your britney branch review, just swamped; will still get to it this week

 15:22 <slangasek> barry: and now you can use it for testing s390x all-snap images!

 15:22 <barry> \o/

 15:23 <slangasek> alrighty

 15:23 <slangasek> any questions?

 15:23 <slangasek> one week to release

 15:23 <slangasek> I think you maybe all know what to do :)

 15:24 <pitti> I think it's time for an early 4.9 kernel!

 15:24 <xnox> AOB: why did she not choose Bernie as VP? Also, only 80 sleeps until Christmas. Regent Street decorations are going up.

 15:24 <barry> pitti: yes, because bisecting kernel failures for 4.8 was so much fun!

 15:25 <pitti> "if it's hard, do it more often"

 15:25 <xnox> i still see a few bugs w.r.t. 4.8 kernel filed for ppc64el....

 15:25 <pitti> barry: "was" → "is"

 15:25 <pitti> also on x86

 15:25 <pitti> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bugs?field.tag=kernel-4.8

 15:25 * xnox doesn't use legacy architecutres

 15:25 <barry> awesome

 15:25 <slangasek> xnox: because politics is complicated and political advisors all have their own bias when it comes to deciphering what will win an election :)

 15:25 * pitti wants to see xnox's s390x phone

 15:25 <cyphermox> xnox: for you legacy == !s390x?

 15:26 <xnox> cyphermox, not made by IBM =)

 15:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:26 <slangasek> anything else, for realsies?

 15:26 <cyphermox> you know, people could argue the other way around...

 15:26 <cyphermox> not from me ;)

 15:26 <cyphermox> oh actually

 15:26 <slangasek> Monday is nat hol in the US

 15:26 <pitti> any OMGcritical installer bugs known that are in foundation land?

 15:26 <xnox> perfect timing

 15:26 <cyphermox> also thanksgiving in Canada

 15:26 <xnox> pitti, well just the last minute port from Qt4 to Qt5.

 15:26 <slangasek> oh indeed

 15:27 <slangasek> so a few of us will be snoozing Monday

 15:27 <cyphermox> pitti: other icon stuff

 15:27 <cyphermox> (for ubiquity)

 15:27 <bdmurray> what's the status of bug 1626622?

 15:27 <xnox> are both cyphermox & infinity going to celebrate extended thanksgiving? is that on a thursday?

 15:27 <cyphermox> but I've finished the pyqt5 porting, and the icons I will fix in a bit

 15:27 * xnox googles when is canadian thanksgiving

 15:27 <cyphermox> monday

 15:27 <xnox> ah monday.

 15:28 <slangasek> yes, Canadian is at a higher latitude, so the harvest comes earlier, therefore it's on a Monday instead of a Thursday

 15:28 * cyphermox read altitude

 15:28 <xnox> slangasek, right......

 15:29 <bdmurray> xnox: Are you still looking at bug 1611256?

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1611256 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "X to Y upgrade fails with gconf2 depends on python3:any; however: Package python3 is not configured yet." [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1611256

 15:29 <xnox> you could have fooled me

 15:29 <bdmurray> Oh, bug 1626622 seems fixed so don't worry about that.

 15:34 <xnox> bdmurray, no.

 15:35 <bdmurray> xnox: Do you have time to?

 15:35 <slangasek> chiluk: ok

 15:35 <xnox> bdmurray, i really should.

 15:35 <xnox> it was trivial to reproduce, cause my laptop hit it

 15:36 <slangasek> [ACTION] xnox to investigate bug #1611256
