 16:40 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:40 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:40 <mdeslaur> \o

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on the samba updates

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I plan on releasing those probably this week

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and I have some other updates in the security team proposed ppa that need testing

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and I'll see if I can pick something else from the list after that

 16:41 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it from me, sbeattie?

 16:42 <tyhicks> I don't think he's in yet so I'll go

 16:42 <tyhicks> I'm in the community role this week

 16:42 <tyhicks> I have a lot of email catchup to do from the holidays (as I'm sure we all do)

 16:43 <mdeslaur> ctrl-a, del

 16:43 <tyhicks> after that, I plan on helping jjohansen with the AppArmor stacking work

 16:43 <tyhicks> :)

 16:44 <tyhicks> I'd also like to spend a little bit of time looking at rngd and if it works to seed /dev/random with the hwrng on the beagle bone black

 16:44 <jjohansen> well right up until you get to that third email ...

 16:44 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <jjohansen> I will be looking at (drowning in) the email backlog as well

 16:46 <jjohansen> besides that it doing AppArmor stacking work

 16:46 <jjohansen> well and I guess syncing up with sbeattie and the kteam on where the kernel is

 16:46 <jjohansen> s/kernel/kernel workflow/

 16:47 <jjohansen> that is it for me sarnold you are up

 16:47 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:47 <sarnold> also digging my way out of email

 16:48 <sarnold> will continue the dpdk mir this week, aiming to finish it soon

 16:48 <sarnold> will help out with apparmor kernel patch review once that's finished

 16:48 <sarnold> and learn how to speak in complete sentences next week

 16:49 <sarnold> chrisccoulson?

 16:49 <tyhicks> jjohansen: do we have any pending apparmor kernel patch reviews to be done?

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I've got a thunderbird update to do this week. And it looks like Oxide and Chromium too

 16:49 <mdeslaur> oh forgot to mention. because of my two-week holiday, I completely forgot how debian packaging works.

 16:49 <tyhicks> I thought I went through all pending patches in the last working week of 2015

 16:49 <jjohansen> tyhicks: no, I think you covered it all

 16:49 <tyhicks> sarnold: fyi ^

 16:49 <sarnold> oh hooray :)

 16:50 <jjohansen> of course since sarnold has so much fun with them ...

 16:50 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: sorry, go ahead :)

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I'll be working through my e-mail backlog (well,  ctrl+a, del) and doing some reviews

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 16:51 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: lots of updates :)

 16:52 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: impressive that you can remember how debian packaging works across the weekends

 16:52 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:52 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:52 <tyhicks> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 16:52 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 16:52 <tyhicks> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:53 <dholbach> just because you mentioned highlighted packages... maybe somebody could take a look at bug 1528682? I saw it in the sponsoring queue today

 16:53 <ubottu> bug 1528682 in ffmpeg (Ubuntu) "FFmpeg security fixes December 2015 II" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1528682

 16:54 <dholbach> but it's not a real discussion item... :)
