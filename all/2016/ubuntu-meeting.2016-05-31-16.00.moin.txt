 16:01 <cpaelzer> nice bunch of waving to start with the meeting

 16:01 <cpaelzer> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <cpaelzer> the only older open action was about the importer which was announced already by nacc

 16:02 <cpaelzer> checking for anything else we might miss ...

 16:02 <nacc> ack, rbasak and i decided to sort of rewrite the algorithm, so a v2 beta will be announced this week :)

 16:02 <cpaelzer> thanks nacc

 16:03 <cpaelzer> nacc: there was a question about "waiting for importer" on #ubuntu-server today

 16:03 <cpaelzer> nacc: I gues the answer is, not yet and wait hpow v2 looks like then?

 16:03 <cpaelzer> anyway, lets go on then

 16:03 <cpaelzer> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:04 <rbasak> The current version is usable, but v2 may rewrite history, that's all.

 16:04 <cpaelzer> thanks rbasak

 16:04 <cpaelzer> anything important for Yakkety development from your side?

 16:04 <cpaelzer> today pitti announced a major change to dns resolving

 16:04 <rbasak> Nothing from me. It's merge time, but I understand we don't have that many major ones.

 16:04 <cpaelzer> you might all check whatever you own or love if things are still as they should

 16:05 <cpaelzer> there is a mail thread on ubuntu-devel about it

 16:05 <rbasak> Remember grep-merges to find your TIL packages please.

 16:19 <cpaelzer> rbasak: thank you

 16:19 <jgrimm> rbasak, i'd like to keep it, as its somewhat low importance. good one for me. :)

 16:19 <rbasak> OK

 16:20 <cpaelzer> rbasak: I'll keep track if it and hope the reporters test once it is in proposed, but free to pass another one to my inbox

 16:20 <rbasak> cpaelzer: fancy taking bug 1495988?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> rbasak: I'll start looking at it in non existing spare time :-)=

 16:21 <rbasak> I have one fairly bulky one I'd like to delegate please.

 16:21 <cpaelzer> assigned myself in the bug

 16:22 <rbasak> Thanks cpaelzer!

 16:22 <rbasak> bacula is pretty broken generally in Xenial it seems. There are about four bugs. I think one or two are remaining to figure out, and then we can SRU.

 16:22 <rbasak> Is someone available to drive that please?

 16:22 <rbasak> I guess not. I'll stick them in the backlog.

 16:23 <rbasak> I think I'm done then. Thanks all!

 16:23 <rbasak> Any other comments from anyone?

 16:23 <nacc> rbasak: i probably TIL'd it (the merge), i can take a look

 16:23 <rbasak> nacc: for bacula? Thank you!

 16:23 <nacc> rbasak: yeah

 16:24 <nacc> rbasak: feel free to just assign in lp and i'll prioritize them up

 16:24 <rbasak> ack

 16:24 <rbasak> I guess we're done then. Thanks all!
