 16:09 <caribou> arosales: only wily & trusty

 16:09 <arosales> jamespage: ack re nova-lxd hallyn may be marking it as resolved

 16:20 <jgrimm> yep, not a priority but will probaby SRU

 16:21 <jgrimm> fixed in xenial

 16:21 <arosales> jgrimm: tghanks

 16:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1521438 in ceph (Ubuntu Xenial) "Another MAX AVAIL bug unweighted OSD" [High,Triaged]

 16:22 <arosales> rbasak: thanks
