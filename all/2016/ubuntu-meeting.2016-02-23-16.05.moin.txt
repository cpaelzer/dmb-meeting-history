 16:06 <ubottu> bug 1543025 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Xenial) "Wrong UTC zoneinfo in cloud-images" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1543025

 16:06 <jgrimm> ^^  only action point from last week

 16:07 <smoser> yeah. fun. i need to fix.

 16:07 <jgrimm> smoser, anything to report on this one?

 16:07 <smoser> no.

 16:07 <jgrimm> no worries. been a busy busy busy last 2 weeks

 16:07 <jgrimm> #topic Xenial Development

 16:07 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:08 <cpaelzer> FYI - we are successfully at DPDK 2.2.0-0ubuntu1 in xenial now - time to push the MIR again now

 16:08 <jgrimm> And FeatureFreeze hit last week.. thanks for all the teamwork and digging in that everyone did

 16:09 <jgrimm> Anyone want to talk about any FFE or other items related to FeatureFreeze?

 16:09 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: rbasak is not here but we might define an action for next weeks agenda to parse our open bugs if anything is super-critical before Xenial GA

 16:09 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, agreed

 16:10 <rharper> jgrimm: did we file/update FFE for docker ?

 16:10 <jgrimm> rharper, i don't think we need one

 16:10 <rharper> oh

 16:10 <rharper> hrm, ok

 16:10 <jgrimm> as have standing MRE

 16:10 <rharper> interesting

 16:10 <jgrimm> though it was agreed we need to update it

 16:11 <rharper> ok

 16:11 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: updated about the way it is now handled?

 16:12 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, there was an agreement in 14.04 timeframe for an MRE for docker.io. but that agreement said the situation should be reexamined in the 16.04 timeframe

 16:12 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks

 16:12 <jgrimm> np

 16:13 <jgrimm> smoser, do you have FFEs to file yet?  i saw squid, lxd, etc..

 16:13 <smoser> i have to file cloud-init still :-(

 16:13 <jgrimm> ok, that's what i was thinking of too

 16:13 <smoser> squid derailed me. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/squid3/+bug/1547640

 16:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1547640 in squid3 (Ubuntu Xenial) "proxy tries ipv6 and gets 503 when no ipv6 routes" [High,In progress]

 16:14 <jgrimm> totally understand.  I'm very impressed andreas figured out what triggered it

 16:14 <smoser> i uploaded those to wily and trusty proposed. *big* thanks to Paul Gear who pointed out the fix.

 16:14 <jgrimm> \o/

 16:15 <jgrimm> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:15 <jgrimm> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:16 <jgrimm> as cpaelzer noted.. we need to move to bug smashing mode next

 16:16 <cpaelzer> yeah, the list itself has nothing "new" other to the squid which smoser worked on

 16:17 <cpaelzer> ... in the server list

 16:17 <cpaelzer> there should be some more dpdk issues that I filed, I need to ask rbasak how I need to tag them when triaging

 16:18 <jgrimm> indeed.  and we've put off triaging over the last couple weeks, so that needs to happen by next week imo

 16:18 <jgrimm> #action rbasak (et al) catch up on traige

 16:18 * meetingology rbasak (et al) catch up on traige

 16:18 <jgrimm> since he is out today. :)

 16:18 <jgrimm> moving on..

 16:19 <jgrimm> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:19 <caribou> I'm good, sprinting this week

 16:19 <jgrimm> nice

 16:20 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:20 <matsubara> amd64 and i386 Xenial server ISO images were last published on the 19th due to a conflict installing libpam-systemd  229-1ubuntu2 and systemd 229-1ubuntu4. ISO image is built from an rsync'ed mirror archive which had some old version which caused the failure. cjwatson explained the issue in #ubuntu-devel and ISO publication should be back to normal in the next ISO build.

 16:20 <matsubara> that's all from me jgrimm

 16:20 <jgrimm> matsubara, thanks!

 16:20 <jgrimm> any questions from others?
