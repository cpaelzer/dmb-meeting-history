 16:41 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:41 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:41 <jdstrand> this week:

 16:41 <jdstrand> finalize various snappy interface PR reviews (I'm waiting on feedback)

 16:41 <jdstrand> address feedback in 32bit binaries on 64bit snap-confine PR

 16:41 <jdstrand> various snappy policy updates

 16:41 <jdstrand> pick up dbus-app PR now that the snappy team is back

 16:42 <jdstrand> start poking at network-namespace interface

 16:42 <jdstrand> if have time, start implementing seccomp arg filtering policy that uses the arg filtering feature we implemented a long time ago

 16:42 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:43 <mdeslaur> looks like sbeattie isn't here, so I'll go next

 16:43 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:43 <tyhicks> you're always second :)

 16:43 <mdeslaur> oh, hrm, right

 16:43 <mdeslaur> off-by-one

 16:43 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:43 <mdeslaur> and I'm still working on ImageMagick

 16:44 <mdeslaur> and I'm off on friday

 16:44 <mdeslaur> and...that's all folks

 16:44 <mdeslaur> err...who's after sbeattie?

 16:44 <tyhicks> looks like sbeattie isn't here, so I'll go next

 16:44 <mdeslaur> hehehe

 16:44 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:45 <tyhicks> I've got some SRU team followup to do on the apparmor 14.04 SRU

 16:45 <tyhicks> there's an eCryptfs issue that I need to at least look into

 16:45 <tyhicks> and hopefully I can get a start on seccomp logging changes for snappy

 16:46 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:46 <tyhicks> jjohansen: go ahead

 16:46 <tyhicks> oh, I had one more thing for snaps on 14.04

 16:46 <tyhicks> I need to backport dbus unrequested reply protections to 14.04's dbus

 16:47 <tyhicks> that's really it for me this time

 16:47 <jjohansen> 'm working on bugs,

 16:47 <jjohansen> I have the unix domain socket cross ns issue to do more testing on,

 16:47 <jjohansen> the noisy logging of apparmor/.null files,

 16:47 <jjohansen> several memory leaks due to reference counting,

 16:47 <jjohansen> hopefully I'll have more info on 100026726

 16:47 <jjohansen> and I also have ADT test failures to look into more

 16:49 <jjohansen> and if I get time, upstreaming work

 16:49 <jjohansen> thats it for me

 16:49 <jjohansen> sarnold: you're up

 16:50 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:50 <sarnold> and finally things feel back to normal after travels, so I'll probably return to the backlog of MIRs

 16:51 <sarnold> that ought to be enough to keep me busy until the next release or sprint, so that's it for me :)

 16:51 <sarnold> chrisccoulson?

 16:51 <tyhicks> good idea before the next wave come in

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> I've got a firefox update this week, and I also need to do a new oxide release

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> I'll hopefully be carrying on with https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oxide/+spec/ubuntu-webview-implementation, although I'm currently bogged down with investigating a crash at the moment

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> I think that's pretty much me done

 16:52 <tyhicks> thanks chrisccoulson

 16:52 <tyhicks> sbeattie: go ahead

 16:52 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:52 <sbeattie> I have openjdk-7 updates to test from tdaitx, and I need to finish up the python updates I was working on

 16:53 <sbeattie> I have kernel signoffs to do, and some tooling work to do around the kernel update process as well

 16:53 <sbeattie> I need to get back to apparmor stuff, too

 16:53 <sbeattie> that's probably more than enough for this week

 16:53 <sbeattie> tyhicks: back to you

 16:54 <tyhicks> thanks
