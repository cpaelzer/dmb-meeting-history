 16:05 <jgrimm> (jamespage) checkin with old iscsitarget users on relevancy with new kernels

 16:06 <jgrimm> jamespage, around ^^

 16:07 <jgrimm> seems not, i'll take action to follow-up in email, this has sat around in actions for a long while

 16:07 <nacc> jgrimm: thanks

 16:08 <jgrimm> #action jgrimm: send jamespage email about iscsitarget

 16:08 <jgrimm> that looks to be only thing from last week

 16:09 <jgrimm> #topic Zesty Development

 16:09 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:09 <jgrimm> anyone want to discuss something wrt Zesty?

 16:09 <teward> *raises hand* I broke nginx for a short while in Zesty two weeks ago... fixed now, but we can thank Debian's security fix patch and a small mistake on my part for that.

 16:10 <teward> there's going to be an nginx merge I'd like some spot checking on and testing when I finish prepping it, i'll send a mail to the list for the call for testing

 16:10 <jgrimm> cool, thanks for being on top of that teward

 16:10 <teward> yep

 16:10 <jgrimm> i know cpaelzer is working through gnarly strongswan merge..

 16:11 <cpaelzer> yeah and dovecot just donw

 16:11 <rbasak> I'm still trying to land mysql-5.7 5.7.16.

 16:11 <jgrimm> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-z-server-core

 16:11 <powersj> jgrimm: from last week we should email server list re: powerpc + debian

 16:12 <jgrimm> powersj, thanks for the reminder

 16:12 <jgrimm> so what powersj is is referring to is that debian is dropping powerpc arch

 16:13 <jgrimm> so i'm planning to send an email to ubuntu mls on the future (or possibly lack of) future for that arch in  ubuntu

 16:13 <jgrimm> #action jgrimm: email ubuntu dev mailing lists about powerpc arch

 16:13 * meetingology jgrimm: email ubuntu dev mailing lists about powerpc arch

 16:14 <jgrimm> if you have capacity to help with merges feel free to sign yourself up in the blueprint; but i'll probably do some active recruitment shortly too

 16:15 <jgrimm> nacc, i have general agreement from maas team with python-django moving forward

 16:15 <nacc> jgrimm: great

 16:15 <nacc> importer changes are almost done, working on `usd ` today and I will pivot to merges

 16:16 <jgrimm> i talked to that team last week and they asked that we do it early in cycle if possible

 16:16 <nacc> ack

 16:16 <jgrimm> nacc, cool. thanks

 16:16 <nacc> i'll sync with them before upload

 16:16 <jgrimm> thanks, you may also want to check with the debian openstack folks, looks like they are planning an even newer django soon.

 16:35 <jgrimm> #topic Open Discussion

 16:36 <jgrimm> I took a TODO to get a formal SRU exception for cloud-init processed.  We've been behaving as such without having anything really formal in place with conditions/testing needed.
