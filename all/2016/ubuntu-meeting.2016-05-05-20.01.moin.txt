 20:01 <ahoneybun> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:01 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu May  5 20:01:35 2016 UTC.  The chair is ahoneybun. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:01 <meetingology> 

 20:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 20:01 * elacheche_anis shares some Apple Soda with ahoneybun :)

 20:01 <ahoneybun> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:02 <ahoneybun> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:02 <ahoneybun> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:02 <ahoneybun> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:02 <ahoneybun> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:02 <ahoneybun> #topic Alfredo Hern치ndez

 20:02 <ahoneybun> your up aldomann_

 20:04 <aldomann_> yep, just writing a long paragaph :P

 20:04 <Kilos> let him catch up

 20:04 <elacheche_anis> OK, TYT then :)

 20:06 <aldomann_> Hello, my name is Alfredo Hern치ndez, I'm a studying physics and I've been involved in the Ubunut comunity for 7 years now (which is one third of my life, now that I think about it). My "real" involvement in open source projects started with elementary OS (I was heavily involved in the l10n process when they were just starting). Lately I've been an active member of the Ubuntu GNOME project, which is why I'm here

 20:06 <aldomann_> here is my wiki page with a more detailed contribution history: Hello, my name is Alfredo Hern치ndez, I'm a studying physics and I've been involved in the Ubunut comunity for 7 years now (man,

 20:08 <ahoneybun> Any questions for Alfredo? Any supporters here?

 20:08 <aldomann_> technically yes, I'm a member ~ubuntu-es and ~ubuntu-uk, but I've never been really involved in their activities

 20:08 <Kilos> aldomann_ are you a member of a LoCo

 20:09 <Kilos> sorry

 20:09 <Kilos> i ask because i am trying to remotivate locos

 20:09 <elacheche_anis> No questions here.. aldomann_ you should try to get involved in the neirest loco.. It's good to meet and encourage people IRL

 20:09 * ahoneybun saw that email

 20:09 <ahoneybun> I work with mine

 20:09 <Kilos> locos shouls support their members applying for membership

 20:10 <ahoneybun> in fact we have a Ubuntu Hour this saturday

 20:10 <ahoneybun> anywya

 20:10 <aldomann_> well, I tried to join the Catalan team once

 20:10 <ahoneybun> I like the logo for Ubuntu GNOME aldomann_

 20:10 <ahoneybun> we have a few Ubuntu GNOME users in my loco

 20:10 <aldomann_> and it was too much paperwork

 20:11 <aldomann_> nice!

 20:11 <Kilos> paperwork?

 20:11 <ahoneybun> paper, work?

 20:11 <Kilos> should be easy to join a loco

 20:11 <elacheche_anis> aldomann_: We should talk about that "paperwork".. Maybe later.. There is too many LoCos issues that the boards may dig to know about them.. Anyway..

 20:11 <aldomann_> yep, that's what I thought

 20:11 <aldomann_> although it may have changed now

 20:12 <ahoneybun> mm

 20:12 <aldomann_> I've been in my personal crusade of converting everyone I know to linux, though :P

 20:13 <elacheche_anis> Good aldomann_ :) That's the spirit :D

 20:13 <aldomann_> which is terribly easy in the field of physics, Windows just sucks for it
