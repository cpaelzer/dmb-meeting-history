 17:00 <gnuoy> #startmeeting openstack-charms-meeting

 17:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Jun  8 17:00:48 2016 UTC.  The chair is gnuoy. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 17:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 17:00 <beisner> o/

 17:00 <gnuoy> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 17:00 <ddellav> o/

 17:01 <gnuoy> #subtopic gnuoy Talk to stub about moving his leadership layer into core

 17:01 <tinwood> o/

 17:01 <gnuoy> This is less relevant as I went a different path

 17:01 <gnuoy> I ended up gating things like db_sync on leadership down in the layer itself rather than in the top handler

 17:02 <gnuoy> I'll close that action

 17:02 <gnuoy> #subtopic gnuoy review 16.07 deliverables

 17:02 <gnuoy> I'll defer this again until we're closer to the date

 17:02 <gnuoy> #subtopic jamespage update on relicensing of charms

 17:02 <gnuoy> He is going to contact people outside of Canonical who have contributed to the charms and ask if they are happy if the licensing of the charm moves from GPL v3 to Apache-2.0. This is so that our charms comply with the licensing policy for OpenStack big-tent projects

 17:02 <gnuoy> #link http://governance.openstack.org/reference/licensing.html

 17:02 <jamespage> ok

 17:02 <jamespage> I've sent email to openstack-dev with intent; and emailed contributors outside of canonical directly to ask them to respond on the ML thread

 17:03 <gnuoy> excellent, thank you

 17:03 <gnuoy> #topic Moving communication Upstream

 17:03 <gnuoy> We're currently pushing communication to upstream channels. So, we'll be creating a new openstack-charms IRC channel on freenode and moving email discussions about charm operation and charm development to the OpenStack mailing lists.

 17:03 <gnuoy> In addition we'll be pushing to update our documentation, both in the charms and various web pages.

 17:04 <jamespage> we should probably move this meeting to an openstack-meeting channel as well?

 17:04 <gnuoy> Emails the OpenStack mailing lists should have [charm] at the start of their subject line

 17:04 <gnuoy> jamespage, +1

 17:04 <jamespage> gnuoy, are you ok to take an action to make that happen?

 17:04 <beisner> #link http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev

 17:04 <gnuoy> #action gnuoy move meeting to openstack-meeting channel

 17:04 * meetingology gnuoy move meeting to openstack-meeting channel

 17:04 <tinwood> We tend to have most conversations on irc.  When do they/should they move to he ML?

 17:05 <beisner> jamespage, gnuoy - meeting time slots on the 2 (or 3) openstack-meeting channels is pretty tight.   some projects use their own channel, and that can be an ok option i think.

 17:05 <gnuoy> tinwood, I don't think we should move conversations to a mailing list

 17:05 <jamespage> that's a good question - I think when its something design oriented or significant

 17:05 <jamespage> ML

 17:05 <jamespage> otherwise general chat still in irc imhp

 17:05 <gnuoy> +1

 17:05 <tinwood> sounds good

 17:05 <gnuoy> beisner, ok, thanks for the heads up

 17:05 <beisner> +1 irc for day to day convos

 17:05 <jamespage> I proposed a rename of the openvswitch-odl charm - that's probably a good example

 17:06 <beisner> indeed

 17:06 * gnuoy needs to fiddle with email filters

 17:06 <tinwood> So things that have knock on effects, etc.

 17:06 <gnuoy> #topic State of Development for next Charm Release

 17:07 <gnuoy> Most of the HA code in the OpenStack layers has now landed, so OpenstackCharms built on top of the Openstack Layers should be able to easily enable service HA. Work continues on DNS HA, Barbican and workload status management in the OpenStack layers. anyone, want to add anything?

 17:07 <jamespage> how are we with CI progress beisner?

 17:08 <beisner> we're now adding a repo-info on the fly just ahead of push and publish to the charmstore

 17:08 <beisner> that will allow users / triagers to determine exactly where a cs: revno came from

 17:08 <jamespage> \o/

 17:09 <beisner> those files should never live in the charm source repos - only ever in a built/published artifact

 17:09 <beisner> example:  https://jujucharms.com/tempest/

 17:09 <gnuoy> thanks beisner

 17:09 <beisner> next up is injecting the build step into the existing CI, which I plan to have tactically in place this week.

 17:09 <gnuoy> tip top

 17:09 <thedac> nice

 17:10 <beisner> we'll have some things to adjust i'm sure, but the basic commit -> build -> test -> publish flow should be good

 17:10 <gnuoy> #topic Release Bugs

 17:10 <gnuoy> #link https://goo.gl/HJjORI

 17:10 <gnuoy> I haven't gone through them in the last week but will be looking through again tomorrow. If anyone has anytime to look as well that would be great.

 17:10 <gnuoy> We're one up on last week I think, so not exactly an avalanche, although I think jamespage has done some work

 17:11 <gnuoy> #topic Open Discussion

 17:11 <gnuoy> Anyone got anything OpenStack charm related to get off their chests?

 17:11 <gnuoy> anyone got anything on their mind?

 17:11 <beisner> src dirs are still on my mind

 17:12 <gnuoy> in a good way?

 17:12 <beisner> ;-)

 17:12 <tinwood> Like or dislike

 17:12 <beisner> i may have waffled on ya

 17:12 <beisner> let's discuss in more detail in day 2 day though.  proceeding to support both methods (vanilla layers, and the proposed src charm model)

 17:12 <thedac> ha!

 17:13 <gnuoy> kk

 17:13 <thedac> FWIW I lean toward no src dir

 17:13 <tinwood> splitter

 17:13 <beisner> i'd like to see us list the distinct benefits of doing it really

 17:13 * tinwood is sorry

 17:14 <beisner> other than it feels/looks better, naturally :)

 17:14 <gnuoy> yes, it does

 17:14 <tinwood> I'll add to the design doc on CI some points.

 17:14 <gnuoy> feels/looks better, I mean

 17:15 <beisner> from a devex perspective, having another method could be confusing

 17:15 <beisner> take the cephs

 17:15 <beisner> ceph-osd and ceph-mon are to be vanilla layers.  buildable as a charm and consumable as a layer.

 17:15 <beisner> but the ceph layer would be  src charm, with a diff dir structure

 17:15 <beisner> ie ceph layer not intended to be reconsumed as a layer

 17:16 <tinwood> Should the ceph-osd/ceph-mon be layers AND charms?

 17:16 <beisner> that's a good question.  the *can* be.   should they?

 17:16 <tinwood> i.e. another 'thing' that trivally consumes the ceph-osd layer to be the charm.

 17:17 <beisner> so charm-layer-ceph-osd with the guts, and a thin wrapper in charm-ceph-osd?

 17:17 <tinwood> possibly, although even that feels like a hack.

 17:17 <beisner> with the latter being a src charm

 17:18 <beisner> i think it's one or the other isn't it?

 17:18 <tinwood> yes

 17:19 <gnuoy> I don't feel that strongly tbh. I like the src dir because it means that files which are only used to build the charm do not pollute the built charm but *shrug*

 17:20 <thedac> My arguments against src dir are 1) We are artificially introducing the concept of "top layer"  2) Theoretical future need to consume "top layer" as a middle layer (cephs good example) 3) The developers of reactive and the first reactive charms don't use a src dir

 17:20 <beisner> i agree with that aesthetic benefit entirely

 17:20 <thedac> But I am certainly open to debate

 17:20 <gnuoy> I think point 2 could be argued both ways tbh

 17:21 <thedac> I am just publicly committing to my argument :)

 17:21 <gnuoy> If we don't want a top layer to be consuable the src dir is a good way to distinguish it.

 17:21 <gnuoy> I find the argument that the src charm is a layer a bit force tbh

 17:21 <beisner> it feels a bit like building a thing but then saying:  you can't extend or re-use it for some other currently unimagined purpose.

 17:22 <thedac> And my point is how can we know for certain now that some point in the future we will not want/have to consume a "top" layer again the cephs are good examples

 17:22 <tinwood> I'm not overly attached either way.

 17:23 <jamespage> I don't think using the src directory now precludes us from moving a charm to be a layer later...

 17:23 <beisner> true, git mv ftw

 17:23 <jamespage> at least that way we are making a explicit decision that a charm is now consumable as a layer...

 17:24 <thedac> That is the strongest point for src dir. That we are explicitly stating it is NOT supported as a layer

 17:24 <gnuoy> jamespage, please review the etiquette guidelines (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/OpenStackCharmsMeeting)

 17:24 <beisner> lolz

 17:25 <jamespage> ..

 17:25 <jamespage> oops lol

 17:25 <beisner> roflcopters

 17:25 <thedac> heh

 17:25 <gnuoy> Ok, I think we should plough on with the src dir but retain the right to change our minds

 17:25 * tinwood lol

 17:25 <jamespage> +1

 17:26 * thedac falls in line

 17:26 <jamespage> can we have a official vote on that?

 17:26 <tinwood> how do we vote?

 17:26 <gnuoy> we can but I don't know the meeting bot commans
