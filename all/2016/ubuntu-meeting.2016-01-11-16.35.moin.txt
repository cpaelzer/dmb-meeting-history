 16:36 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:36 <tyhicks> Andreas Cadhalpun provided a debdiff for wily for ffmpeg (LP: #1528682)

 16:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1528682 in ffmpeg (Ubuntu) "FFmpeg security fixes December 2015 II" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1528682

 16:36 <tyhicks> Thank you for your assistance in keeping Ubuntu users secure! :)

 16:36 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:36 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:37 <jdstrand> hey

 16:38 <jdstrand> I will be working with zyga on snappy capabilities

 16:38 <jdstrand> I'll be going through existing snappy frameworks as they pertain to new capabilities work

 16:38 <jdstrand> I also have two embargoed issues

 16:38 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:39 <mdeslaur> guess it's my turn

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm currently testing libvirt updates, and have an embargoed update to work on

 16:39 <mdeslaur> after that, I plan on picking something else off the CVE list

 16:39 <mdeslaur> that's about it, sbeattie?

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:40 <sbeattie> I'm reviewing test failures from do ko's test pie build, and need to finish fixing the kernel build to drop pie

 16:41 <sbeattie> I have some outstanding apparmor patches to review

 16:42 <sbeattie> There's a couple of QRT test failures related to new arch bringup I need to investigate

 16:42 <sbeattie> That and normal kernel cve monitoring will likely consume my week.

 16:42 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place

 16:43 <tyhicks> I have an embargoed issue

 16:43 <tyhicks> and otherwise will be focusing on AppArmor stacking work

 16:43 <tyhicks> drive the AppArmor stacking interface designs in libapparmor and securityfs

 16:43 <tyhicks> create easy to use namespace creation APIs and binutils

 16:44 <tyhicks> if I have any downtime, I'll play with rngd and the BBB's hwrng

 16:44 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:45 <tyhicks> jj isn't here yet so you're up sarnold

 16:45 <sarnold> I'm on community this week

 16:45 <sarnold> the server team wil llet us know this week which of the dpdk packages they actually want in main in xenial, so I'll return to that

 16:45 <tyhicks> sarnold: ah, have you been blocked on that?

 16:45 <sarnold> and I'll probably start in on the MIR backlog elsewhere in the meantime

 16:46 <sarnold> tyhicks: not really, email and bug backlogs ate most of last week, and john's userspace dfa code was a nice change :)

 16:46 <tyhicks> ok

 16:47 <sarnold> so while it's strictly true that Id idn't work on it as a result of not knowing, it wasn't like Iwas starved for things to do :)

 16:47 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> This week I plan to get thunderbird out, and then I'm hoping to get back to normality after the post-holiday craziness (so I'll be tackling some of https://launchpad.net/oxide/+milestone/branch-1.13)

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> I don't have any other updates planned. I think that's it for me

 16:50 <tyhicks> thanks
