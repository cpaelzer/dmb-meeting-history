 16:10 <caribou> smoser: no just alternate nick

 16:10 <smoser> nice.

 16:11 <caribou> ok, been sprinting last week and used the opportunity to work on a few multipath-tools bugs

 16:11 <caribou> rharper: I'm planning to SRU the Xenial fix that you sent to debian

 16:11 <caribou> rharper: I'm also about to SRU a double-free segfault to Trusty

 16:12 <caribou> rharper: other than that, I'm about to push release 1.6.0 of makedumpfile/kdump-tools

 16:13 <rharper> caribou: ok, great

 16:13 <caribou> rharper: well, looks like xnox updated it friday

 16:13 <rharper> yeah

 16:14 <caribou> rharper: maybe that should also be SRUed to Xenial

 16:14 <rharper> I'd think so

 16:14 <caribou> rharper: ok will get that one too

 16:14 <rharper> nice

 16:14 <rharper> thanks

 16:21 <jgrimm> for tgt

 16:21 <rharper> jgrimm: yeah, I can rebuild, put it in PPA and see about getting a sponser to upload it to yakkety

 16:21 <jgrimm> cool

 16:24 <rharper> rbasak: 1472639: did not touch yet

 16:25 <jgrimm> rbasak,: response from upstream is that they disabled their bugzilla, so testcase therein is lost.   so puts me back a bit to trying to recreate bug on my own.

 16:26 <jgrimm> s/disabled/decomissioned

 16:27 <rbasak> cpaelzer: 988 I just commented in the other bug.

 16:27 <cpaelzer> thanks

 16:28 <rbasak> cpaelzer: in the general case I would like you to chase as needed please, in order to drive your own bug. With no response, we can fail the SRU and go to the next one if a reasonable amount of time has passed and nobody seems interested.

 16:28 <cpaelzer> that is why I asked - ok, will keep an eye

 16:28 <cpaelzer> do you have the others bug # at hand ?

 16:29 <rbasak> bug 1286882 - sorry I didn't link to it from the other bug.

 16:30 <cpaelzer> great

 16:31 <rbasak> rharper: 406 looks landed? Thank you for driving that.

 16:31 <caribou> rbasak: regarding bug 1286882, I'll check that out first thing tomorrow morning

 16:31 <rharper> rbasak: cool!  Sure.

 16:31 <rbasak> caribou: thanks!

 16:32 <rbasak> magicalChicken: hello! Thank you for joining the meeting if you're here.

 16:32 <rbasak> magicalChicken: please can you report status on: bug 869017, bug 1394403, bug 1511222, bug 1519120

 16:32 <magicalChicken> rbasak: hi

 16:32 <ubottu> bug 869017 in kbd (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu server enables screenblanking, concealing crashdumps (DPMS is not used)" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/869017

 16:33 <magicalChicken> for 1511222, i have submitted a debdiff and verified it fixes the bug for me

 16:33 <rbasak> I think I remember you saying that you weren't sure where to go with 017 next, sorry.

 16:33 <magicalChicken> yeah, the kbd bug looks like it may just need to be a policy issue

 16:33 <magicalChicken> but 1394403 i still have not been able to reproduce with the first submitted patch in place

 16:34 <magicalChicken> i do think that it was fixed with that patch

 16:34 <rbasak> magicalChicken: for 222, does that need sponsoring now? Or do you want the reporter to test success first?

 16:34 <magicalChicken> i submitted a link to a build in my ppa for 222, so the reporter could verify

 16:34 <magicalChicken> it might be good to make sure that the package works for them first

 16:35 <rbasak> magicalChicken: OK, that's fine. Please can you make sure that it is clear in the bug that progress is blocked on the reporter?

 16:35 <magicalChicken> sure, I'll post a comment real quick

 16:35 <rbasak> I'll take the kbd bug.

 16:35 <magicalChicken> and for 120 it was a missing dep, so i have a debdiff that adds vlan to recommends

 16:35 <magicalChicken> awesome, thanks. yeah, i just couldn't figure out how to move forward there

 16:38 <rbasak> magicalChicken: where is the debdiff for 120 please?

 16:38 <magicalChicken> http://paste.ubuntu.com/17650089/

 16:38 <magicalChicken> I'm adding it to the bug rn

 16:38 <rbasak> Great, thanks

 16:38 <rbasak> magicalChicken: also subscribe ~ubuntu-sponsors please, if it's ready for sponsoring.

 16:39 <magicalChicken> sure, yeah

 16:39 <rbasak> That's everyone I think. nacc didn't have any bugs assigned this past week. Did I miss anything?

 16:40 <nacc> rbasak: mostly caught up with php (now just syncing the rest of them), will try to look at bacula today

 16:40 <rbasak> nacc: that's great, thanks!

 16:40 <rbasak> So I had lined up to assign: bug 1585771, bug 1553563, bug 1570923

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1585771 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu Xenial) "Automatic security upgrades are always enabled" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1585771

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1553563 in bacula (Ubuntu) "bconsole to Bacula Director fails with authorization problem message" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1553563

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1570923 in bacula (Ubuntu Xenial) "bacula-dir won't start with "undefined symbol: mysql_init"" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1570923

 16:40 <rbasak> nacc: are you able to take 563 and 923 now please?

 16:40 <rbasak> And who wants 771?

 16:41 <rbasak> Who has capacity?

 16:41 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, were you looking for another bug?

 16:41 <cpaelzer> not really

 16:41 <cpaelzer> since I wasn't able to touch the one I got last week

 16:42 <nacc> rbasak: yeah

 16:42 <jgrimm> heh.  fair enough.

 16:43 <rbasak> nacc: thank you!

 16:43 <rharper> rbasak: I'll take 771

 16:44 <rbasak> rharper: thanks!

 16:44 <jgrimm> rharper, rbasak: that one just needs looking after right?

 16:44 <rbasak> Right.

 16:44 <jgrimm> that is, 771 looks like its making progress, i think robie was just wanting someone to watch after it

 16:44 <rharper> sure

 16:44 <rbasak> Actually, looking now, it looks like it might already be fixed by cyphermox, or at least an SRU in progress.

 16:45 <rharper> see cpaelzer you should have taken it

 16:45 <rbasak> So if rharper you could just check that it's all good from a server perspective, that would be appreciated.

 16:45 <rharper> rbasak: indeed

 16:45 <rharper> rbasak: anything else for the meeting ?

 16:45 <jgrimm> not from me

 16:45 <rbasak> That's all I had. Thanks all. Again, I'm really pleased about the progress everyone is making on this effort - thank you.

 16:46 <rharper> rbasak: thanks for keeping us on task =)

 16:46 <rharper> ok, thanks folks
