 15:05 <tdaitx> - investigating plugins to start the 2 containers+tests on separated machines using jenkins (required for ppc64el/arm64 as Oracle's reference is amd64 only)

 15:07 <bdmurray> Its not AOB time yet!

 15:08 <slangasek> cyphermox was working on some ubiquity blockers for beta this morning, perhaps he's still tied up there

 15:08 <slangasek> so:

 15:08 <slangasek> * short week, was off Thu-Fri last week; played a lot of email catch-up

 15:14 <caribou> Interview & meetings

 15:14 <caribou> â˜‘ Done

 15:14 <doko> - started test rebuilds (unfortunately before linux 4.8 was there)

 15:14 <doko> - fix build failures, chase people to fix build failures

 15:14 <doko> - merges to fix build failures

 15:14 <doko> - MIR processing intensified

 15:14 <doko> - openjdk-9 update

 15:14 <doko> - forwarding GCC reports

 15:14 <doko> - try to enable lldb on s390x

 15:14 <doko> - chasing down autopkg test failures with pitti

 15:14 <doko> (done)

 15:14 <cyphermox> oi

 15:15 <caribou> "<doko> - MIR processing intensified", yeah I did feel that one go by ;)

 15:15 <cyphermox> MIR:

 15:15 <cyphermox> - review unity-scope-click

 15:15 <cyphermox> ubuntu-core:

 15:15 <cyphermox> - review console-conf merges

 15:15 <cyphermox> xenial:

 15:15 <cyphermox> - prepare IPv6 initramfs SRUs

 15:15 <cyphermox> yakkety:

 15:15 <cyphermox> - discussion on image build issues with Josh

 15:15 <cyphermox> - prepare new shim snapshot with fallback fix

 15:15 <cyphermox> - upload isc-dhcp and initramfs-tools for IPv6 in initramfs

 15:15 <cyphermox> Â±other stuff:

 15:15 <cyphermox> - fixes in shim EKU code and fix PR

 15:15 <cyphermox> - implementing dhcpv6 in initramfs w/ lamont

 15:15 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:15 <cyphermox> well, and that ubiquity thing that looks like an issue in polkit

 15:15 <lamont> \o/ dhcpv6

 15:16 <cyphermox> yay

 15:16 <slangasek> cyphermox: are you still driving the polkit fix, or is this on someone else now?

 15:17 <cyphermox> no, I'm still trying to make sure and figure out whether that really is the case; I could certainly use help from someone more familiar with polkit though

 15:17 <slangasek> ok

 15:17 <pitti> note that the new initramfs-tools didn't land yet, as it breaks reboot with at least the multipath-tools test (which still works in y-release)

 15:17 <slangasek> policykit-1 last uploaded 25 Jul

 15:17 <slangasek> has this been broken this long?

 15:17 <cyphermox> that said, looks to me like starting sudo ubiquity helps connecting wifi with NM; and would probably do the same for the drivers

 15:18 <cyphermox> (I mean, otherwise ubuntu-drivers works, lists the drivers, and you can drive it manually on the command-line, so no reason for it not to work via ubiquity)

 15:20 <cyphermox> pitti: I don't know why it breaks multipath-tools; I'll check later

 15:20 <cyphermox> "breaks multipath-tools" <  the tests, doesn't mean it actually breaks anything in mpath

 15:20 <pitti> right

 15:20 <slangasek> cyphermox: who can help with polkit, then?

 15:20 <cyphermox> I don't know

 15:20 <slangasek> pitti: do you know polkit enough to help? I see your name in the changelog :)

 15:20 <cyphermox> pitti: didn't you know about polkti?

 15:20 <pitti> cyphermox: I didn't look deeply into it, there was too much other stuff to firefight today

 15:21 <slangasek> of course, you're applying a patch from seb128

 15:21 <pitti> slangasek: yes, I do, I just didn't get aware of *that* bug yet :)

 15:21 <pitti> which LP# is it?

 15:21 <slangasek> cyphermox: there, found you someone to help :)

 15:21 <cyphermox> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1626108

 15:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1626108 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Ubiquity session isn't setting up 3rd party hardware drivers" [Undecided,New]

 15:22 <cyphermox> pitti: tbf I'm not sure it's polkit, I'm just very suspicious of it because of the denies I get from NM along the way too

 15:22 <pitti> cyphermox: can you break this down to a pk-check call?

 15:23 <pitti> there's no debugging information in that LP bug, but it seems you alredy did some; can you please put the notes there?

 15:23 <cyphermox> I have no idea what this is supposed to be doing in terms of an actual pk action, only that it runs ubuntu-drivers --autoinstall and expects it to write a file with a list of drivers to install

 15:23 <pitti> well, but that part all happens as root already

 15:24 <cyphermox> my testing was limited to trying to run ubuntu-drivers on the terminal

 15:24 <cyphermox> I don't know that it does?

 15:24 <cyphermox> ubiquity is definitely started as a user

 15:24 <slangasek> pitti, cyphermox: continue OOB after meeting?

 15:24 <pitti> *nod*

 15:24 <cyphermox> yep

 15:24 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:24 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:25 <bdmurray> xnox asked about SRU team staffing...

 15:25 * slangasek nods

 15:26 <slangasek> anyone volunteering? :)

 15:26 <xnox> I volunteer apw

 15:26 <slangasek> isn't he already on the team?

 15:26 <apw> yep

 15:27 <bdmurray> he doesn't have a daily shift listed though

 15:27 <slangasek> ah

 15:27 <apw> la la la

 15:27 <bdmurray> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Publishing

 15:27 <xnox> apw, should not have been so mean to arges then =)

 15:27 <apw> heh, there is that

 15:28 <slangasek> arges has assured us that this is not his reason for leaving

 15:28 <slangasek> which just means we should've made him do a double SRU team shift while we had him

 15:28 <slangasek> so, if apw wants to volunteer to take a shift, cool

 15:28 <xnox> slangasek, to make sure that it would become the reason?!.... =)

 15:28 <slangasek> or maybe apw wants to volunteer another member of his team for SRU training :)

 15:29 <slangasek> xnox: if he was going to leave anyway... ;)

 15:29 <apw> slangasek, they will love me

 15:29 <slangasek> anyway, I only see people volunteering other people

 15:29 <slangasek> so yes, we will want to figure out SRU team shifts post-arges

 15:30 <slangasek> but not solving that here and now

 15:30 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:30 <bdmurray> I thought rbasak was interested in joining the team some time ago

 15:30 <slangasek> that rings a bell

 15:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you want to follow up with him?

 15:30 <bdmurray> slangasek: sure

 15:31 <slangasek> ta

 15:31 <slangasek> going once...

 15:32 <slangasek> going once and a half...

 15:32 <sil2100> Oh the tension
