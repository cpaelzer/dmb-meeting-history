 16:02 <jgrimm> ah, nacc any movement on php cleanup?

 16:02 <nacc> jgrimm: still working on it, refocusing on that this week

 16:02 <jgrimm> great! steve brought that up to me in 1x1 yesterday

 16:02 <nacc> got a few packages fixed in debian, but then the debian maintainers also said they'd rather delete a package then get an NMU fix

 16:03 <nacc> so... we'll see where that goes

 16:03 <jgrimm> no worries, just wanted to poke it forward a bit

 16:03 <gnuoy> thanks nacc, jgrimm

 16:03 <nacc> jgrimm: ack

 16:03 <gnuoy> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:03 <gnuoy> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:03 <gnuoy> I believe rbasak will go over current assigned bugs at the end, anything for now?

 16:04 <jgrimm> looks good

 16:04 <gnuoy> ta

 16:04 <gnuoy> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:08 <jgrimm> no sir

 16:08 <gnuoy> #topic Open Discussion

 16:08 <teward> o/ (late, sorry)

 16:08 <teward> situational awareness wrt nginx:

 16:08 <teward> security fix released last week, uploaded to Yakkety

 16:09 <teward> merge is on hold because I observed Debian indicating they're still 'testing' dynamic module support

 16:09 <teward> makes me think it's not entirely stable yet

 16:09 <teward> so i'll keep an eye on that, but that todo on the blueprint'll remain BLOCKED or TODO un‎til it looks OK

 16:09 <jgrimm> thanks teward! on top of things as always

 16:09 <gnuoy> would anyone like to get anything else off their chest?

 16:09 <cpaelzer> gnuoy: before you close, you might want to pass chair to rbasak for bug discussion

 16:10 <gnuoy> yep, one step ahead of you

 16:10 <cpaelzer> :-)

 16:10 <gnuoy> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:11 <cpaelzer> 1507681 waiting for sponsoring (as last week), 1495988 just subscribed sponsors a few minutes ago

 16:12 <rbasak> cpaelzer: sorry, I did say I'd review that. I will make a note.

 16:13 <rbasak> I don't see magicalChicken here so I'll ask him in #ubuntu-server after this meeting.

 16:13 <cpaelzer> rbasak: as I "only" wait for sponsoreing review - you may pass me another one - might find no time but better I know one if time suddenly shows up

 16:13 <rbasak> cpaelzer: that's a good point, thank you,.

 16:13 <nacc> rbasak: nothing on the bacula bugs (although they are moving to the top of my list today). 1524635 submitted a fix, but it didn't quite work (I believe i made a mistake, testing a fix now). I would think 1570472 and 1457957 are the same, possibly?

 16:14 <nacc> (the latter being assigned to rharper)

 16:14 <caribou> cpaelzer: 1495988 only have a task for the dev release. What series do you need to SRU to ?

 16:14 <cpaelzer> trusty

 16:14 <caribou> cpaelzer: ok, will take care of that

 16:14 <cpaelzer> caribou: +1 karma

 16:15 <nacc> rbasak: 1423498, waiting for user testing

 16:15 <rbasak> Thanks caribou!

 16:15 <cpaelzer> caribou: let me know if there is anything not as it should be

 16:15 * rbasak is catching up on nacc's responses

 16:15 <caribou> cpaelzer: sure

 16:15 <nacc> rbasak: 1570472, gave feedback to sdeziel, waiting on a new patch to review

 16:16 <rbasak> nacc: OK so bug 1524635 is making progress, but I think you need a bug task for Trusty? Shall I create that?

 16:16 <ubottu> bug 1524635 in haproxy (Ubuntu) "haproxy syslog configuration causes double logging" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1524635

 16:17 <nacc> rbasak: yes, please (was going to ask for it once i had filled out the SRU template, as that's the order on the wiki page)

 16:17 <rharper> sorry, here now

 16:17 <rharper> rbasak: on the augeas bug, I'm working on a reproducer; should have that today with a suggestion from someone

 16:17 <rbasak> Ah, OK. I presume the SRU page has that order to prevent needless bug tasks, but I think for our team here it's fine to create them in advance if we reasonably think that an SRU will be needed.

 16:17 <nacc> rbasak: ack, will update my mental model :)

 16:18 <rharper> rbasak: for libnl3, that's all fixed released at this point; I don't think there is anything left to do in that bug.

 16:18 <jgrimm> \o/

 16:19 <rharper> rbasak: rsync, I don't know what else to do with it, we're stuck without a reproducable data, someone hits it but never shares their datafile;  I tried the simple Xenial rsync to Trusty but wasn't that trivial to hit (as we've said multiple times)

 16:19 <rharper> will poke at the puppet bug today as well;

 16:19 <rbasak> nacc: for bug 1423498, I think it's OK to mark it cleared for now. Please follow up if it makes any progress.

 16:19 <ubottu> bug 1423498 in squid3 (Ubuntu Trusty) "FTP upload causes squid hang" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1423498

 16:20 <nacc> rbasak: yep, agreed

 16:20 <nacc> rharper: you may want to look at 1570472, and your puppet bug may be a dupe

 16:21 <rharper> nacc: thanks for the heads up;

 16:21 <rharper> ISTR that someone else was looking at a similar issue before X released

 16:22 <rbasak> nacc: puppet dupes> yeah, seems likely. Please can you or rharper agree, dupe and assign to just one of you as necessary?

 16:22 <rharper> rbasak: ack

 16:22 <nacc> rbasak: ack

 16:22 <rharper> nacc: you're bug looks nicer (see debdiff attached) =)

 16:23 <nacc> rharper: i spent some time on my puppet bug this week, i can look at yours and decide

 16:23 <nacc> rharper: also true :)

 16:23 <rharper> cool

 16:23 <rharper> also sdeziel is on yours which helps move things along =)

 16:23 <nacc> yep

 16:24 <rbasak> OK so I'll mark rharper's 957 as cleared in my tracking spreadsheet, but please do mark the dupe in LP too. Thanks!

 16:24 <rharper> np

 16:24 <nacc> yep

 16:25 <rharper> rbasak: any other thoughts on the rsync bug ... I mean, we can only say so many times that we need a dataset that reproduces it to fully understand the fix and regression potential

 16:25 <rbasak> rharper: agreed but I'm still catching up, sorry. I'll get there in a moment.

 16:25 <rharper> rbasak: np

 16:25 <rbasak> nacc: I think I'm done with your progress updates - thank you.

 16:26 <nacc> rbasak: np, thanks -- feel free to add more bugs to my plate as you go

 16:26 <nacc> i may start a pad or something to help track my own status on them, fwiw

 16:26 <rbasak> I've got some new bugs to assign lined up. I'll cover them after I catch up on progress.

 16:26 <rbasak> Sorry this is taking a while - I'm juggling a ton of bug numbers :)

 16:28 <rbasak> rharper: OK so bug 1384503 next. I agree with you. I would update the bug description with a "[Status]" section right at the top with basically what you just said, and then we can leave it Incomplete and consider it cleared from a tracking perspective. If you could stay subscribed or assigned please, then if it does make any progress we can track it again.

 16:28 <ubottu> bug 1384503 in rsync (Ubuntu Trusty) "rsync fails on large files with compression" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1384503

 16:28 <rbasak> rharper: I find that updating the status right at the top makes it really clear for those who comment and complain etc without actually reading all the comments.

 16:29 <rharper> rbasak: OK ,will do

 16:29 <rbasak> rharper: marking bug 1511735 as cleared - thank you for driving and suffering all that pain!

 16:29 <ubottu> bug 1511735 in libnl3 (Ubuntu Trusty) "libnl: fail to bind() netlink sockets" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1511735

 16:30 <rharper> rbasak: sure

 16:30 <rbasak> Noting bug 1491406 as making progress, thank you.

 16:30 <ubottu> bug 1491406 in augeas (Ubuntu) "augeas-lenses-1.2.0 - NagiosCfg lens broken for /etc/nagios.cfg due to spaces" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1491406

 16:31 <rharper> rbasak: yep, I should have the reproducer done today, and iwth that I can create a debdiff with the fix pulled from upstream/current-release

 16:31 <rbasak> Sounds good!

 16:31 <rbasak> OK I'm done with progress updates I think. Did I miss anything?

 16:32 <jgrimm> nicely done. thanks

 16:32 <rbasak> I have four bugs lined up to assign, mainly for continued ramp up.

 16:33 <rbasak> If anyone has any others that may be more important to point out, please do.

 16:33 <rbasak> Bug 1581839 is a good one for packaging practice.

 16:33 <ubottu> bug 1581839 in clamav (Ubuntu Xenial) "package clamdscan 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu4 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite '/usr/share/man/man1/clamdscan.1.gz', which is also in package clamav-daemon 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu0.14.04.1" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1581839

 16:34 <rbasak> Also I have bug 1524526, bug 1544400 and bug 1472639. I don't know if are valid and need an actual upload but it would be good to get these off the list.

 16:34 <ubottu> bug 1524526 in dovecot (Ubuntu Xenial) "Crashes with undefined symbol" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1524526

 16:34 <ubottu> bug 1544400 in squid3 (Ubuntu) "squid3: systemctl reports squid is running when there is a bungled squid.conf and it has exited." [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1544400

 16:34 <rbasak> That will do for now I think, unless anyone has any others that need attention?

 16:34 <rbasak> nacc, I would definitely put your bacula bugs above all of these.

 16:35 <nacc> rbasak: ack

 16:35 <rbasak> Any takers?

 16:36 <rbasak> Well, cpaelzer already volunteered, so I'm going to give him bug 1581839 and bug 1524526.

 16:37 <ubottu> bug 1581839 in clamav (Ubuntu Xenial) "package clamdscan 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu4 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite '/usr/share/man/man1/clamdscan.1.gz', which is also in package clamav-daemon 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu0.14.04.1" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1581839

 16:37 <ubottu> bug 1524526 in dovecot (Ubuntu Xenial) "Crashes with undefined symbol" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1524526

 16:37 <rbasak> nacc's plate is full I think.

 16:37 <cpaelzer> rbasak: thanks

 16:37 <rbasak> rharper, shall I give you bug 1472639 so you don't end up empty?

 16:37 <ubottu> bug 1472639 in openldap (Ubuntu) "apparmor profile denied for kerberos: /run/.heim_org.h5l.kcm-socket" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1472639

 16:37 <rharper> rbasak: sure

 16:37 <cpaelzer> rbasak: as I said this time it might take more time as I'm also a day off, but I'll look into them as soon as I can

 16:37 <rbasak> cpaelzer: sure, that's absolutely fine.

 16:38 <rbasak> We're still on fairly low priority bugs at the moment, but I think things are ramping up well.

 16:38 <rbasak> Please do make a note of anything you think needs more attention and we can assign them next week.

 16:38 <rbasak> Thanks all!

 16:38 <jgrimm> thanks rbasak

 16:38 <rbasak> Any comments or questions before I close?
