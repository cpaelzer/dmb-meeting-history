 19:15 <cyphermox> #startmeeting DMB 2016-02-29

 19:15 <meetingology> Meeting started Mon Feb 29 19:15:25 2016 UTC.  The chair is cyphermox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 19:15 <meetingology> 

 19:15 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 19:15 <cyphermox> Welcome to the Developer Membership board meeting :)

 19:16 <coreycb> o/

 19:16 <cyphermox> #voters bdmurray cyphermox xnox infinity stgraber Laney micahg

 19:16 <meetingology> Warning: Nick not in channel: infinity

 19:16 <meetingology> Current voters: Laney bdmurray cyphermox infinity micahg stgraber xnox

 19:16 <cyphermox> ^ ping DMB members :)

 19:16 <micahg> nice!

 19:16 * stgraber waves

 19:16 <cyphermox> #topic Review of previous action items

 19:17 * bdmurray waves

 19:17 <cyphermox> Has there been any changes to the current only action item listed on the agenda?

 19:17 <bdmurray> I don't think so.

 19:18 <cyphermox> right on

 19:18 <cyphermox> let's keep going

 19:18 <cyphermox> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 19:18 <cyphermox> #subtopic Corey Bryant's openstack package set

 19:19 <coreycb> Hi all

 19:20 <coreycb> well, I don't want to jump the gun but I might as well introduce myself

 19:21 <cyphermox> ah, yes, please do :)

 19:21 <coreycb> I work primarily on OpenStack packaging, in 2015 I led several stable releases and in 2016 I started leading the new release of OpenStack Mitaka

 19:21 <coreycb> Last year I was granted per package upload rights to ubuntu-server-dev

 19:22 <coreycb> my application today is combined for core-dev and per-package upload rights to a newly created openstack package set

 19:22 <coreycb> having per-package upload rights to ubuntu-server-dev has been helpful, but I still have to bother jamespage and zul quite a bit for uploads that I can do myself.  having additional upload rights would really help streamline my work.

 19:23 <coreycb> I contribute back to debian quite a bit too, and am a member of pkg-openstack and debian python modules team

 19:24 <coreycb> I think that's about it for my introduction.  for further details, here's my application wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CoreyBryant/CoreDevAndOpenStackApplication

 19:25 <coreycb> Also here's a list of packages for the openstack package set: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15094028/

 19:25 <micahg> coreycb: are you aware that core dev offers upload rights to the entire archive?

 19:25 <micahg> well, except partner

 19:25 <coreycb> micahg, yes, of course

 19:26 <coreycb> micahg, I"m hoping for core-dev, but my fallback plan is openstack package set.  however, the openstack package set will be useful either way as we have at least one other person right now (and I hope more in the future) who work on openstack packaging who don't yet have rights.

 19:27 <micahg> ok

 19:28 <bdmurray> Could you elaborate on what you mean by "improve the efficiency of my workflows through experience, automation, and various tooling efficiencies"?

 19:29 <coreycb> bdmurray, that's pretty generic, but I'm always learning tricks here and there to make my workflows more efficient

 19:30 <coreycb> bdmurray, we have quite a few packages to maintain, so whether it's scripting or tips and tricks from other package maitainers, I continually try to improve my process

 19:31 <bdmurray> so not improvements to ubuntu-dev-tools or anything else?

 19:31 <coreycb> bdmurray, nothing in particular.  although being able to re-run autopkgtests was a nice improvement

 19:32 <coreycb> bdmurray, also I used to use pbuilder and found sbuild was faster with caching in effect, that's an example.

 19:32 <bdmurray> okay, I was just idly curious

 19:35 <cyphermox> coreycb: my concern with your application for that package set is how much stuff it covers that isn't openstack-specific

 19:35 <coreycb> cyphermox, yes, I was a bit unsure with that to be honest.  so I figured I'd put all the deps that I know of and if we need to reduce it then so be it.

 19:35 <cyphermox> coreycb: tbh, your original list in https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2015-December/000880.html seemed like it better covered openstack, and then other build-depends are just a fact of life when maintaining any set of packages

 19:36 <cyphermox> (though that list might in fact be missing some things too)

 19:36 <coreycb> cyphermox, I can narrow the list down to openstack-only packages, rather than all openstack dependencies

 19:36 <cyphermox> yes, if you could

 19:36 <coreycb> cyphermox, ok I will, after the meeting if that's ok

 19:37 <cyphermox> I think it's probably missing mostly just python-ceilo*, python-designate*, python-glance*

 19:37 <cyphermox> hrm

 19:37 <cyphermox> well, I have nothing against it being refined off-meeting, but that does make the voting complicated

 19:38 <cyphermox> what do others think?

 19:38 <coreycb> cyphermox, there are quite a few that are openstack specific, oslo.*  the python clients and some more

 19:38 <cyphermox> coreycb: yep, I see

 19:39 <cyphermox> let's skip ahead to the other topics then, this would give you time to update the list?

 19:39 <coreycb> cyphermox, I could prob narrow it down before the end of the meeting if you move to another topic

 19:39 <coreycb> yes

 19:39 <stgraber> right, we can't vote on the packageset or on giving you PPU to the set until we agree on a list :)

 19:39 <coreycb> stgraber, ack

 19:39 <cyphermox> ok, skipping over to flexiondotorg

 19:40 <cyphermox> #subtopic flexiondotorg (Martin Wimpress) PPU application for Ubuntu MATE packages

 19:40 <cyphermox> flexiondotorg: you around?

 19:41 <cyphermox> looks like maybe not

 19:41 <cyphermox> #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications

 19:41 <cyphermox> #subtopic Phillip Susi's core-dev application

 19:42 <cyphermox> ... yet no psusi in the channel?

 19:42 <bdmurray> his application seemed a bit incomplete to me

 19:42 <cyphermox> I don't know if he's also known by another nick

 19:42 <cyphermox> let's move on again

 19:42 <cyphermox> #subtopic Tyler Hicks' core-dev application

 19:42 <tyhicks> I was set to be on next week's agenda but I am around now

 19:43 <cyphermox> oh, right

 19:43 <tyhicks> ah, nice

 19:43 <tyhicks> I'm happy to go now

 19:43 <cyphermox> hrm

 19:43 <cyphermox> technically we usually expect a week's notice IIRC

 19:44 <sarnold> I wanted to add an endorsement for tyhicks's application but the few times I checked his wikipage was marked "immutable"

 19:44 <bdmurray> I get a 500 tring to load his application too

 19:44 <cyphermox> not that I care much for that "rule". does anyone object?

 19:44 <bdmurray> s/tring/trying/

 19:44 <cyphermox> yeah, the wiki is bad today :/

 19:44 <tyhicks> the wiki has been bad today

 19:44 <cyphermox> got the page

 19:44 <cyphermox> let me pastebinit

 19:45 <cyphermox> http://paste.ubuntu.com/15246428/

 19:45 <tyhicks> I'll do a quick intro

 19:45 <tyhicks> I'm part of the Ubuntu Security team

 19:45 <tyhicks> I've been active in the -security pockets for ~4 years now

 19:46 <tyhicks> I also work on upstream AppArmor and eCryptfs in support of needed Ubuntu features and bug fixes

 19:47 <tyhicks> I review quite a bit of security related merge proposals that eventually land in Ubuntu, as well

 19:49 <bdmurray> Your application mentions a "I've introduced few regressions". Do you recall any specific ones? If so how did they happen and how were they resolved?

 19:49 <tyhicks> good question

 19:50 <tyhicks> I can't recall a specific regression from a security update but there were a couple

 19:50 <tyhicks> I treat those with extremly high priority

 19:50 <tyhicks> the security team tries very hard to not regress users with updates

 19:50 <tyhicks> after I perform a security update, I closely watch the new bug reports for that source package

 19:51 <tyhicks> I have a browser keyword that lets me quickly view the bugs for a source package, sorted by when they were opened

 19:51 <tyhicks> so I check that bug list, several times a day, for approximately a week after I do an update

 19:52 <tyhicks> I triage all new bug reports to make sure that they're not caused by the security update

 19:52 <tyhicks> if they are, I would work quickly to figure out the cause and upload a fix

 19:52 <tyhicks> then I'd release a new Ubuntu Security Notice to explain the regression

 19:53 <tyhicks> sorry I can't remember a specific regression but that would be how I would address any such regression

 19:54 <bdmurray> okay, thanks

 19:54 <bdmurray> sarnold: did you want to say something since it didn't make the wiki?

 19:55 <sarnold> bdmurray: thanks; I've found tyler to be very helpful over the last several years -- he's always willing to help me solve problems and find the root causes of issues.

 19:55 <tyhicks> thanks, sarnold :)

 19:55 <sarnold> tyler does careful, thoughtful work, and very thouroughly tests issues locally before releasing packages or patches

 19:56 <sarnold> he's also able to ask others for help when necessary :)

 19:56 <micahg> Hi Tyler, I've noticed that you only appear to have 5 sponsored uploads to the main archive in the last 18 months, is there a reason you're applying now as opposed to earlier when you were seemingly more active in the main archive

 19:57 <tyhicks> hi micahg

 19:57 <tyhicks> micahg: I should have applied earlier

 19:57 <tyhicks> I don't have a reason as to why that didn't happen outside of time

 19:58 <tyhicks> I grew tired of having to ask others for sponsoring and put my foot down this time around :)

 19:58 <tyhicks> if my application is approved, I strongly feel like my activity in the main archive will increase

 19:59 * jdstrand knows he will-- he'll stop doing the apparmor uploads at the very least ;)

 19:59 <jdstrand> hey micahg :)

 19:59 <jdstrand> too many pronouns

 19:59 <micahg> hi jdstrand

 19:59 <jdstrand> I know tyhicks will do more uploads cause I will be doing fewer :)

 20:00 <tyhicks> that's a good point

 20:00 <jdstrand> the same for kirk land

 20:00 <jdstrand> I imagine

 20:00 <tyhicks> yes

 20:01 <tyhicks> micahg: does that answer your question?

 20:02 <micahg> well, partially, if it's mainly 2 (or a handful) packages that you need upload rights to in order to relieve others of the need to upload, wouldn't PPU be more appropriate?

 20:03 <jdstrand> fwiw, tyhicks is highly active with main between ecryptfs, apparmor, touch and snappy. having him with core-dev will allow him to more effectively work on those projects and the devel release, where he can do security updates rather than having others do them/sponsor them

 20:03 <tyhicks> it isn't a handful of package that I need upload rights to

 20:03 <tyhicks> for instance, I'm in the process of updating didiwiki for a security issue as part of my Security Team community work this week

 20:03 <tyhicks> stable releases are affected as well as Xenial

 20:04 <tyhicks> being able to upload to the dev release is important since I do security updates in wide range of packages

 20:04 <micahg> right, but I"m wondering what happened in the last year or so where that work hasn't seemingly been reflected

 20:05 * jdstrand always felt that being a member of the security team and able to update anything in a stable release but not (yet) a core-dev to be an odd incongruency

 20:05 <bdmurray> tyhicks: were you less active in main recently because you were developing apparmor features?

 20:05 <micahg> jdstrand: I tend to agree with that :)

 20:05 <jdstrand> anyway, I don't mean to distract...

 20:05 <tyhicks> bdmurray: yes - developing apparmor features is one reason my upload count decreased

 20:06 <micahg> were you not doing community rotations on the security team during that time that required dev release uploadS?

 20:06 <tyhicks> however, my security upload count didn't decrease: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tyhicks/CoreDevApplicationSecUploads

 20:06 <tyhicks> micahg: I've been in and out of the rotations while developing features

 20:10 <micahg> I've been referencing http://ubuntu-dev.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Tyler+Hicks&sponsoree_search=name

 20:10 <cyphermox> Are we ready to vote?

 20:11 <tyhicks> ubuntu-sponsorships doesn't cover security uploads which is why I created the extra list

 20:12 <cyphermox> right, and picking one near the end from the sponsored list shows that (for example), ecryptfs-utils you did changes in, just Dustin claimed the upload/sponsored

 20:13 <tyhicks> correct

 20:13 <tyhicks> I believe you're referring to this one: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecryptfs-utils/110-0ubuntu1

 20:14 <cyphermox> yep

 20:22 <cyphermox> I'll take care of the LP magic right after the meeting

 20:23 <cyphermox> coreycb: still around?

 20:23 <coreycb> yes!

 20:23 <coreycb> congrats tyhicks!

 20:23 <cyphermox> bdmurray: do you have time to deal with the packageset?

 20:23 <coreycb> Here's the new list for the openstack pkg set: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15246586/

 20:23 <coreycb> also reminder I'm going for core-dev as well

 20:23 <cyphermox> yeah

 20:24 <cyphermox> the meeting is getting pretty long though

 20:24 <coreycb> I was afraid of that..

 20:24 <cyphermox> just trying to make sure we have quorum

 20:24 <cyphermox> #topic openstack packageset

 20:24 <bdmurray> cyphermox: I think we should be fair and finish.

 20:24 <cyphermox> ah?

 20:25 <cyphermox> do we have people waiting for a meeting after?

 20:25 <bdmurray> I mean finish talking about coreycb since we started with him.

 20:25 <cyphermox> ah, yes

 20:25 <cyphermox> that's my opinion too

 20:26 <bdmurray> Perhaps we should address core-dev first though?

 20:26 * cyphermox shrugs

 20:26 <coreycb> bdmurray, that is fine with me, either way, I appreciate your time on this

 20:27 <cyphermox> I'd deal with the packageset first tbh, especially since it's fairly straightforward

 20:27 <bdmurray> okay

 20:27 <stgraber> -1 with that description

 20:27 <meetingology> -1 with that description received from stgraber

 20:27 <cyphermox> arf

 20:27 <stgraber> we need sets to have a description that lets us update them on request

 20:28 <stgraber> having the description be "some hardcoded list we were handed over" isn't acceptable

 20:28 <cyphermox> do you have a suggested description?

 20:28 <cyphermox> I was fine with "openstack packages"

 20:29 <stgraber> clearly "openstack packages" isn't clear enough given that we were provided two different lists one of which was clearly unsuitable

 20:31 <cyphermox> oh, is there no selenium package?

 20:31 <coreycb> I'm ok dropping that

 20:31 <micahg> yeah, I don't see one

 20:31 <stgraber> oh, well, you kinda have to considering it doesn't exist in the archive :)

 20:31 <stgraber> There is no current release for this source package in Ubuntu.

 20:31 <cyphermox> right

 20:32 <micahg> +1 without selenium

 20:33 <coreycb> thanks

 20:33 <cyphermox> how do we normally proceed next? explicit voting on granting coreycb upload rights for the new package set?

 20:34 <stgraber> let's do coredev first, then ppu

 20:34 <cyphermox> ok

 20:34 <stgraber> because if he gets coredev he won't need ppu

 20:34 <cyphermox> mmkay

 20:34 <coreycb> sounds good to me

 20:38 <cyphermox> stgraber: thanks

 20:38 <coreycb> stgraber, thanks

 20:40 <stgraber> sorry, going back through the application quickly

 20:40 <coreycb> no problem

 20:40 <coreycb> one thing I would like to point out is that openstack package PPU rights will be useful, however there are still many dependencies that don't fall under that umbrella, of which core-dev would make my job much easier.

 20:45 <coreycb> thanks!

 20:46 <coreycb> thanks for your time too, it was a long meeting today

 20:46 <jamespage> well done coreycb!

 20:46 <cyphermox> #topic Next chair

 20:46 <cyphermox> I guess it's up to micahg next?

 20:47 <bdmurray> I think it was supposed to be infinity today

 20:47 <cyphermox> ah

 20:47 <cyphermox> well,

 20:47 <cyphermox> #action infinity to chair next meeting

 20:47 * meetingology infinity to chair next meeting

 20:47 <cyphermox> the absent are obviously wrong.

 20:47 <cyphermox> #topic any other business?

 20:48 <cyphermox> nothing from me

 20:48 <micahg> election?

 20:48 <cyphermox> ah, sure

 20:49 <cyphermox> a new call for nomination was sent by Dimitri 7 days ago.

 20:50 <cyphermox> it would be nice to have some nominations

 20:50 <micahg> I think we only received one nomination if I'm caught up on main

 20:50 <micahg> s/main/mail/

 20:51 <cyphermox> I don't see one

 20:53 <cyphermox> we should extend the deadline and send another call for nominations if we don't have enough

 20:54 <cyphermox> as I understand it we need 3 at least

 20:54 <bdmurray> I think we should let people expire to force action! ;-)

 20:54 <cyphermox> micahg: you want to take care of sending another call?

 20:55 <micahg> yeah, I guess I can

 20:56 <cyphermox> two more weeks I guess?

 20:56 <micahg> well, the terms expire 3/9 (before the next meeting)

 20:57 <cyphermox> I don't think we'll see enough in one week + 2 days

 20:58 <cyphermox> we should ask to extend the terms a bit until time X, which would be the end for the call for nomination

 20:58 <cyphermox> #action micahg to send new call for nominations

 20:58 * meetingology micahg to send new call for nominations

 21:02 <cyphermox> I'll be happy to ask TB for term extension for those expiring so we get more nominees

 21:02 <cyphermox> I think that's enough for the meeting

 21:03 <cyphermox> stgraber: bdmurray: anything else?

 21:03 <bdmurray> nope

 21:03 <cyphermox> #endmeeting
