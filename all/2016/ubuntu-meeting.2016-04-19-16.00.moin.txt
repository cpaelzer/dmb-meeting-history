 16:00 <hallyn> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <hallyn> None :)

 16:01 <hallyn> #topic Xenial Development

 16:01 <matsubara> o/

 16:01 <hallyn> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:01 <hallyn> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:01 <hallyn> no wait,

 16:01 <hallyn> so the release team is currently physically co-located making that xenial magic happen,

 16:01 <hallyn> anything we need to discuss regarding that?

 16:02 <hallyn> i'll take that as no, let' sgo on to release bugs,

 16:02 <hallyn> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:02 <jgrimm> not that i'm aware of

 16:02 <hallyn> kewl

 16:02 * hallyn waiting for htat link to load...

 16:02 <hallyn> all i see is '38 bugs', but it won't show them to me,

 16:03 <hallyn> jgrimm: (since i can't see them yet) any particularly concerning bugs on that list?

 16:03 <jgrimm> looking

 16:03 <hallyn> finally loaded, i see 5 high/triaged

 16:04 <nacc> jgrimm: shoudl the mysql-5.6 bug not be in that list? since 5.6 is in universe now?

 16:04 <hallyn> one of those is actually fix-released

 16:04 <nacc> or is it to track if 5.7 has the same issue?

 16:04 <hallyn> that list seems to be out of date

 16:04 <rbasak> All 5.6 bugs should probably be moved to 5.7 at some point.

 16:05 <nacc> (LP: #1455818)

 16:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1455818 in mysql-5.6 (Ubuntu Wily) "mysql-server-5.6.postrm fails when /usr/share/mysql-common/configure-symlinks doesn't exist" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1455818

 16:05 <nacc> rbasak: ack, that's what i was wondering

 16:05 <rbasak> That's an SRU only I think, isn't it?

 16:05 <jgrimm> right

 16:05 <hallyn> looks like bug 1398999 should be fix-committed for nova

 16:05 <ubottu> bug 1398999 in nova (Ubuntu Wily) "Block migrate with attached volumes copies volumes to themselves" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1398999

 16:05 <nacc> should it have [SRU] to document that, rbasak ?

 16:05 <hallyn> but i don't know how they handle their bugs, so...

 16:05 <rbasak> nacc: if you like.

 16:06 <cpaelzer> in the list is one I looked at before - the reported failed to reports what I asked for but anybody with an AMD FX-* cpu could take a short look at bug 1561019 to make sure it isn't critical in any way

 16:06 <ubottu> bug 1561019 in libvirt (Ubuntu Wily) "copied cpu flags don't match host cpu" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1561019

 16:06 <rbasak> nacc: the metadata makes it clear if you look at the bug, but I appreciate [SRU] may be helpful to see immediately in a report.

 16:06 <nacc> rbasak: ack, updated

 16:07 <nacc> well, that brings up another question about this list, shouldn't we only be concerned about xenial release bugs?

 16:07 <hallyn> cpaelzer: is that one amd-specific?

 16:07 <cpaelzer> well, the reporter says cpu flags are missing

 16:07 <cpaelzer> it works for me on my cpu

 16:07 <rbasak> Yeah that's one of the issues with that list, IMHO. Milestones would work better since they can more easily be moved or dropped as appropriate.

 16:07 <cpaelzer> and he reported it explicitly as "on AMD FX-8350"

 16:07 <cpaelzer> hallyn: so the confirmation needed would be AMD specific

 16:07 <nacc> rbasak: ack, thanks

 16:09 <hallyn> cpaelzer: all right i put tha ton my list for later today, let' smove on

 16:09 <cpaelzer> hallyn: thanks

 16:09 <hallyn> any other bugs critical to discuss?

 16:10 <hallyn> if not, moving on,

 16:10 <hallyn> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:10 <hallyn> hey caribou

 16:10 <hallyn> paging caribou,

 16:11 <hallyn> \o happy tuesday :)  moving on,

 16:11 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:11 <hallyn> hey matsubara

 16:11 <matsubara> hallyn, nothing to report

 16:11 <hallyn> that's what i love to hear,

 16:11 <hallyn> thanks, moving on,

 16:11 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:11 <smb> No big badaboom as of yet. Watching the release train approach...

 16:11 <hallyn> i hear it's at the station, boarding,

 16:12 <hallyn> thx, moving on,

 16:12 <hallyn> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:12 <hallyn> contaienrcon deadline is actually coming up i think,

 16:12 <hallyn> (for toronto)

 16:12 <hallyn> anything else server-related?

 16:13 <hallyn> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:13 <hallyn> openstack summit of course is coming up,

 16:13 <hallyn> bunch of lucky folks visiting lovely austin tx,

 16:14 <hallyn> any other team related events?

 16:14 <hallyn> ok, moving on,

 16:14 <hallyn> #topic Open Discussion

 16:14 <teward> nginx may be getting an update today, if infinity approves it (bugfixes whoohoo!)

 16:15 <hallyn> in xenial?

 16:15 <teward> and unrelated: every server-related summit, conference, etc. seems to be in Austin this year (nginx.conf is one, later this year, which I may be attending)

 16:15 <teward> hallyn: yes - infinity is already in the loop on this

 16:15 * teward briefed him prior to FinalFreeze

 16:15 <hallyn> my nefarious machinations are unrelated to that (austin) tidbit, fwiw

 16:15 <teward> yep

 16:15 <hallyn> cool

 16:16 <teward> and that's all from me., apologies for being late, some non-ubuntu security things needed my attention

 16:16 <hallyn> congratulations, that's quite a feat, rough week to get something included :)

 16:16 <teward> :P

 16:16 <hallyn> ok, so i think we're done,

 16:16 <hallyn> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:16 <teward> if it doesn't land today due to FInal, it's a 0-day SRU, but we're seeing some HTTP/2 stuff that needs to land

 16:17 * teward is done :)

 16:17 <hallyn> next meeting will be on April 26, 16:00 utc.

 16:17 <hallyn> i'm not sure whether arosales or rbasak will be chairing

 16:17 <hallyn> teward: yup sounds important :)

 16:17 <hallyn> thanks everyone!

 16:17 <hallyn> #endmeeting
