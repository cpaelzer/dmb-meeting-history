 16:03 <powersj> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:03 <powersj> (jamespage) checkin with old iscsitarget users on relevancy with new kernels

 16:03 <powersj> jgrimm: any update here?

 16:03 <jgrimm> openstack summit this week

 16:03 <powersj> ah yes

 16:03 <powersj> leave on for one more week?

 16:04 <jgrimm> sure. i don't have any context on that item, but we can do over email if needed

 16:04 <powersj> (cpaelzer) investigating severity of issues covered by qemu 2.5. stable releases and ask other Teams on

 16:05 <cpaelzer> yo

 16:05 <cpaelzer> all the Crits in the delta from us to the latest stable were already covered by the security Team

 16:05 <cpaelzer> I got some feedback

 16:05 <cpaelzer> all that I got referred to cases where doing it pro-actively broke stuff

 16:05 <cpaelzer> so I guess the consensus is - unless we have any reason to do so we keep it as is

 16:06 <cpaelzer> there are about two in there which could be considered "high" but it depends so much on the particular setup that it is hard to rate "comunity wide"

 16:06 <cpaelzer> so TL;DR - not bringing in 2.5.1.1 proactively

 16:07 <cpaelzer> powersj: that item done, ready for the next if there are now further questions

 16:07 <powersj> #done cpaelzer investigating severity of issues covered by qemu 2.5. stable releases and ask other Teams on their input

 16:07 <powersj> cpaelzer will try to ask Stephen Hemminger for more data on the netdev presentation

 16:07 <cpaelzer> yeah that is the next one

 16:07 <cpaelzer> I met him, and not only asked but discussed in detail

 16:08 <cpaelzer> while this was an entertaining discussion there isn't much he could share that would help us to identify new issues or address them

 16:08 <cpaelzer> but

 16:08 <cpaelzer> I found good contact in Intel for openvswitch dpdk and at least for that will work on analyzing some East/West Traffic issues that our Testing in regard to ovs-DPDK inveiled in the last dev cycle

 16:09 <cpaelzer> any questions on that?

 16:09 <cpaelzer> powersj: you have the timout duty to call it none, mark it done and go on

 16:09 <powersj> #done cpaelzer will try to ask Stephen Hemminger for more data on the netdev presentation

 16:09 <powersj> powersj to update agenda to remove yakkety add in zesty

 16:09 <powersj> #done powersj to update agenda to remove yakkety add in zesty

 16:10 <powersj> that's all the action items, moving on

 16:10 <powersj> #topic Zesty Development

 16:10 <powersj> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:10 <cpaelzer> the page doesn't exist yet

 16:10 <jgrimm> heh

 16:10 <cpaelzer> But I'm sure your link will be correct one day

 16:10 <powersj> Yeah I just changed yakkety -> zesty

 16:10 <cpaelzer> one thing on zesty dev

 16:10 <cpaelzer> I just discussed with rbasak on that earlier today

 16:11 <cpaelzer> there is no debootstrap for zesty yet

 16:11 <cpaelzer> that means you can hardly (only with workarounds) do sbuild, autopkgtest and such

 16:11 <cpaelzer> the TL;DR of our discussion was that zesty atm should be considered only "somewhat open" for development

 16:12 <cpaelzer> until that shows up in backports for your release - likely Xenial/Yakkety

 16:12 <cpaelzer> rbasak: andyinth to add?

 16:12 <cpaelzer> "anything"

 16:12 <rbasak> No, that covers it.

 16:12 <rbasak> It'll probably be in updates rather than backports.

 16:12 <cpaelzer> true

 16:12 <cpaelzer> ok, just thought worth to mention it here for all

 16:12 <jgrimm> thanks, i hadn't known that. :(

 16:13 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: you can just fire and forget upload - but if you like testing before :-)

 16:13 <powersj> is it on us or foundations or other to get that updated?

 16:13 * rharper joins late

 16:13 <cpaelzer> on foundation I think, the question is if we could get a hook somewhere to be notified once it is ready to go - and maybe an ETA

 16:14 <rbasak> AFAICT, it usually happens when some developer gets fed up and JFDI

 16:14 <rbasak> I don't think anyone would object if one of us did the update.

 16:14 <rbasak> (though do coordinate in #ubuntu-devel to avoid duplicate effort, etc)

 16:15 <jgrimm> would be good to know if its on someone's plate already/eta

 16:16 <cpaelzer> rbasak: you likely have the best connections - would you reach out to them for the question of jgrimm?

 16:16 <rbasak> ack

 16:17 <rbasak> Is it just debootstrap?

 16:17 * powersj wonders how hard a symlink + change log entry could be ;)

 16:17 <rbasak> powersj: it's not hard in the slightest - just needs someone to do it :)

 16:17 <cpaelzer> powersj: quite often the devil is in the detail

 16:17 <powersj> if I hear no movement I may just try

 16:18 <cpaelzer> powersj: wait until rbasak pings us after inquiring maybe?

 16:18 <powersj> yeah

 16:18 <cpaelzer> rbasak: you could drop whatever you find out to server-dev list or such - ok ?

 16:18 <rbasak> ack

 16:18 <powersj> alright, any other topics for zesty dev?

 16:19 <powersj> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:19 <powersj> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:19 <jgrimm> nacc has imported a bunch of server packages

 16:19 <jgrimm> he's out today

 16:19 <powersj> ah yes!

 16:19 <powersj> I'll capture in notes

 16:20 <jgrimm> basically pre-imported list of server packages that are out of date wrt upstream version

 16:20 <cpaelzer> I'm on the dovecot one and about 5 others, but while a lot of work non is like exploding the system for anybody

 16:21 <powersj> anything else?

 16:21 <jgrimm> #link https://code.launchpad.net/~usd-import-team/+git

 16:21 <powersj> thx!

 16:21 <jgrimm> that's all i had

 16:21 <cpaelzer> did my first re-merge

 16:21 <cpaelzer> using the toolchain

 16:21 <cpaelzer> so far I could fix all I needed together with nacc

 16:21 <jgrimm> nish still owes an email out to ml

 16:22 * smoser started a mega-import to see failures

 16:22 <cpaelzer> smoser: did that mean many imports or a packet with weird and huge history?

 16:22 <smoser> using https://gist.github.com/smoser/4c5480b3c98c37a4eff0715e51f2c27b

 16:22 <jgrimm> always gotta break things

 16:22 <smoser> just started top to bottom alpha on main

 16:33 <powersj> I don't like seeing all that red, so I'm still looking

 16:39 <rbasak> So powersj is taking it.

 16:39 <rbasak> Thanks powersj!

 16:39 <jgrimm> rbasak, you'll sponsor?

 16:40 * powersj may learn to keep his mouth shut ;)

 16:40 <rbasak> Sure

 16:40 <jgrimm> rbasak, cool, tx

 16:40 <powersj> anything else?

 16:41 <jgrimm> smoser, cloud-init updates?

 16:41 <smoser> not a lot. i made a couple merges

 16:41 <smoser> still have some to do, and really wanting to try magicalChicken's integration test.

 16:42 <powersj> smoser: I proposed one to add coverage to unit tests

 16:42 <smoser> yeah, saw that. will look again.

 16:42 <powersj> ok thx

 16:43 <powersj> final comments?

 16:43 <jgrimm> smoser, i'm interested in snap-create-user support (rharper)..

 16:43 <smoser> it is in trunk now.

 16:43 <smoser> rharper and i working on getting an 'all-snap' image going.

 16:44 <rharper> sometime today if cloud-init daily ppa kicks off; I'll have a new core snap recipe building against cloud-init daily ppa

 16:44 <jgrimm> smoser, and https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1611074

 16:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1611074 in cloud-init "Reformatting of ephemeral drive fails on resize of Azure VM" [High,Fix committed]

 16:44 <smoser> believed fixed in trunk

 16:44 <jgrimm> yeah, needs fixed in xenial tho

 16:44 <smoser> rharper, https://code.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/+archive/ubuntu/daily is seemingly good to go

 16:44 <rharper> cool,

 16:45 <rharper> I'll create the recipe for core snap to build against that daily

 16:45 <smoser> jgrimm, well, yes. i will look to update zesty today.

 16:45 <jgrimm> smoser, cool. tx

 16:45 <rharper> we've an almost fully working image for OpenStack;  currently chasing down why we don't mount the boot partition properly; this prevents snapd from confirming that we booted into grub (or uboot); which blocked installing new snaps;  a workaround is to bind mount it from where it got mounted

 16:46 <rharper> hoping to get an image booted in EC2 sometime today and update the status in the document

 16:46 <jgrimm> rharper, smoser \o/

 16:47 <powersj> last call...

 16:47 <jgrimm> that's all for me
