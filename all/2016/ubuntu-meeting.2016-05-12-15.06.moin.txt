 15:10 <tdaitx> = Security update for OpenJDK 6

 15:10 <tdaitx> * New icedtea 1.13.11 release

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Provided backport to Wily, Trusty, and Precise to the security team on Friday; published on Tuesday

 15:10 <tdaitx> * ARM32 JIT is broken due to the hotspot security update

 15:10 <tdaitx> - IcedTea 1.x patches OpenJDK 6 to add ARM32 JIT

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Differently from IcedTea 2.x it provides no way to disable that build (it is always enabled)

 15:10 <barry> :)

 15:10 <tdaitx> - doko added a small patch to prevent it from being build (thanks!)

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Trusty's OpenJDK 6 is in Universe but also being handled by the security team

 15:10 <tdaitx> - They release to both -security and -updates pockets

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Trying to understand if how much of an overburden this is (if any at all) for them

 15:10 <tdaitx> - If it is, then why do they care for Universe? Got a partial response, need further info

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Will tackle that on our next sprint

 15:10 <tdaitx> = JCK 8

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Build packages for JCK 8

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Being kept on a private repo

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Updated scripts to use the new JCK 8 packages

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Updated setup scripts to use LXD

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Refactoring scripts to break down dependencies and moving further to something that can used in a charm

 15:10 <tdaitx> = Other

 15:10 <tdaitx> * Handling new OpenJDK bugs (duplicates, requesting additional info from users, ...)

 15:10 <infinity> - Clean up ubuntu-core -> ubuntu-base rename

 15:11 <infinity> (done)

 15:11 <xnox> infinity, ubuntu-base is snapish or just-tarball?

 15:11 <pitti> basically a debootstrap tarball

 15:11 <xnox> ack

 15:11 <chiluk> - LP 1579917 - Collected information for Intel, opened bugs with Lenovo as well.

 15:11 <chiluk> - LP 1576747 - half-tabled.  Need to grab debug logs.

 15:12 <infinity> xnox: It's the ubuntu-core rootfs tarball renamed to avoid confusion with people stealing my product name. :P

 15:12 <chiluk> - Merging ...

 15:12 <chiluk> - done

 15:12 <pitti> - lots of SRU reviews (are infinity and me the only ones doing these now?), cleaned up old SRUs

 15:12 <pitti> yakkety planning:

 15:12 <pitti> - Discuss/research/draft convergence-y-replace-upstart blueprint, waiting for cypermox and slangasek to review/approve

 15:12 <bdmurray> pitti: I saw, thanks. I wonder if there isn't some other approach to doing the retracing.

 15:12 <pitti> - Discuss/research/draft convergence-y-replace-upstart blueprint; ongoing, systemd --user is designed differently and it is not yet clear how to apply that (https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2016-May/036440.html)

 15:12 <pitti> (end)

 15:12 <robru> so no slangasek ?

 15:13 <cyphermox> - investigating how to have NM unmanage most devices except wwan and wlan

 15:13 <pitti> bdmurray: we could perhaps first try to run gdb.$release on the host, and fall back to gdb if that doesn't exist? (same for -multiarch)

 15:13 <infinity> pitti: re: are we the only ones doing them?  I suspect that's been true this week, but bdmurray and arges will no doubt wake up again.

 15:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1530530 in gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (Ubuntu) "Installer doesn't show up on some Chromebook" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1530530

 15:13 <arges> infinity: whats the issue?

 15:13 <caribou> Trusty has the fix in lts-xenial

 15:13 <infinity> pitti: I'm also going to get apw in the rotation once he's done a few with handholding.

 15:13 <caribou> Development work:

 15:13 <caribou> - makedumpfile development

 15:13 <caribou> Various contribution from HPE

 15:13 <caribou> further fix for s390 enablement

 15:13 <infinity> arges: SRU queues backing up a bit.

 15:13 <pitti> infinity: oh, nice

 15:14 <caribou> - Various sponsoring : bash-completion, packagekit

 15:14 <bdmurray> pitti: I didn't do my shift last week because of the sprint and the week before I was on holiday.

 15:14 <caribou> â˜‘ Done

 15:14 <sil2100> - Landing team work, silo coordination, preparing landing e-mails

 15:14 <sil2100> - RTM status meetings

 15:14 <sil2100> - General work on OTA-11

 15:14 <sil2100> - Xenial touch transition

 15:14 <sil2100> * Pushing no-change rebuilds after libhybris arm64 enablement

 15:14 <sil2100> * Preparing automated scripts for checking arm64 buildability in touch packages

 15:14 <arges> infinity: i did a bunch yesterday actually...there are just a lot

 15:14 <sil2100> * Various poking people regarding arm64 build failures

 15:14 <sil2100> - Touch translations

 15:14 <sil2100> * Looking into missing translations in exports for OTA-11, poking to get that fixed

 15:14 <sil2100> * Finishing up some automated scripts for langpack sanity-checking

 15:14 <sil2100> - Discussions on tarball release processes

 15:14 <infinity> arges: Ahh, good.  Then nevermind me calling you out. :)

 15:14 <sil2100> - Helping out in getting the jenkaas custom tarball jobs working (firewalls, setup)

 15:14 <sil2100> - system-image:

 15:14 <sil2100> * Figuring out the issue with broken OTAs after key rotation with Barry and fixing it

 15:14 <arges> np

 15:14 <sil2100> * Modifying the documentation

 15:14 <sil2100> * Removing stale unused devices in stable channels

 15:14 <sil2100> * Switching all custom tarball imports from s-jenkins to jenkaas

 15:15 <sil2100> * Promoting generic and generic_x86 to the stable channels

 15:15 <sil2100> (done)

 15:15 <infinity> arges: And yeah, post-lts-release, the queues tend to be worse than usual, as everyone remembers all the bugs they forgot to fix a week before release.

 15:15 <pitti> bdmurray, infinity, arges: I was asking because seb128 seemed interested in joining but didn't get a response last time

 15:15 <infinity> pitti: I'll take that discussion off a public channel. :)

 15:15 <pitti> sil2100: oh, what do you test in langpacks? anything applicable to the distro too?

 15:17 <sil2100> pitti: simple stuff, not sure if it'll be useful: checking image manifests and seeing if any langpacks are missing or added, checking versions, checking contents for .po files (listing if some are missing/added)

 15:17 <pitti> sil2100: the last one seems interesting indeed

 15:17 <sil2100> pitti: basically covering some of the common error cases in our touch POV

 15:17 <pitti> doko: ?

 15:17 <infinity> sil2100: Any kind of testing would be decent.  Our langpack SRU process is pretty awful these days.

 15:17 <infinity> sil2100: So, if you come up with any automation that's remotely handly, please hand it off to pitti and we can make the world a better place.

 15:18 <jose> also, fridge cal? just request in #ubuntu-news

 15:19 <sil2100> infinity: ok, sure, currently the scripts are very touch oriented as in they're looking at certain touch channel top-most images and checking their manifests as well, but certain tests can be made optional I suppose to make it more useful for others too

 15:19 <infinity> sil2100: Right, anything that's checking the actual package contents would be nice to have.

 15:19 <infinity> sil2100: Right now, I think pitti's method is to spot-check a few languages for sanity, make sure nothing was FTBFS, and assume it's all good to promote.

 15:20 <pitti> I usually do some kind of diff <(find old) <(find new) thing as a sanity check

 15:20 <infinity> (And, honestly, it's hard to come up with a "good" test that isn't "find 60 testers who speak 60 languages and ask them to install 400 packages")

 15:20 <pitti> and then download the -de pakcages and test them, but there's not much more

 15:20 <pitti> infinity: that's actually the test plan right now -- install an update, run through a (short) list of verification steps and mark it off on the wiki page

 15:21 <pitti> ok, no doko apparently, so

 15:21 <pitti> #topic AOB

 15:22 <infinity> I recommend we all lose/gain 20 pounds (as appropriate) before Athens, so we can be the sexiest nerds on the beach.

 15:22 * pitti goes off to do about 120.000 push-ups then

 15:22 <infinity> pitti: Yeah, in your case, you might want to gain 50. ;)

 15:23 <barry> ubuntu beach sprint party - awesome movie

 15:23 <infinity> barry: Well, you're not wrong.  It'll cause awe.

 15:23 <pitti> but which beach?

 15:23 <infinity> Perhaps not for the reasons we'd like. :)

 15:23 <barry> or palindromically: ew, a....

 15:24 <cyphermox> infinity: people will go blind from the glare of too much white skin

 15:25 <pitti> AFAIK the ocean is some 5 km away, so not just an easy walk from the hotel :/

 15:25 <infinity> pitti: I recommend whichever beach is most popular with middle-aged American tourists, so we have a fighting chance of finding someone who looks worse in a swimsuit.

 15:25 <pitti> cyphermox: or deaf from getting technobabbled all day?

 15:25 <pitti> ok, clearly..
