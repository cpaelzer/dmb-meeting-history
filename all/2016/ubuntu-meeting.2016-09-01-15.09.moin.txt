 15:10 <tdaitx> = OpenJDK security update

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Further fixes on OpenJDK 6 since now g++ also segfaults when building it on Trusty/arm64

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Added patches to fix headers with pch disabled

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Added watch file + repack script

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Moved package source format to 3.0 (quilt)

 15:10 <tdaitx> = Helping on -proposed

 15:10 <tdaitx> - mozart requires autoconf2.13 which generates code that is unusable by gcc 6 (due to a different output from "g++ -E conftest.C"); not sure how to proceed: patch configure, update to newer autoconf (how?), or what?

 15:10 <tdaitx> - fixing repsnapper FTBFS on powerpc/ppc64el;

 15:10 <tdaitx> * replace abs(double) with std::abs(double) - but why does abs(double) works fine on the other archs? (LP: #1619289)

 15:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1619289 in repsnapper (Ubuntu) "repsnapper FTBFS with gcc6" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1619289

 15:10 <tdaitx> * powerpc/ppc64el missing TCGETS2 - what is the right fix? why is this even needed? (LP: #1619100)

 15:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1619100 in repsnapper (Ubuntu) "FTBFS on ppc64el: termios problems" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1619100

 15:10 <tdaitx> = Other

 15:10 <tdaitx> - Is it my impression or the builders are taking longer to get stuff from the ppas? Even with free build machines and a free queue it takes quite a while to start.

 15:10 <tdaitx> (done)

 15:10 <pitti> autopkgtest:

 15:10 <pitti> - Move result web UI from gazillions of plain files to sqlite and dynamic page generation, as debci kept running out of inodes and suffered from multi-hour delays. New sqlite+flask app now takes 0.1%(!) of the disk space, 10% of the code, and 30 seconds for each update run.

 15:10 <pitti> - Fix "apt-get source" version detection for single-line "Package-List:"

 15:10 <pitti> - britney: Implement Testsuite-Triggers:; should hopefully pinpoint regressions better

 15:10 <pitti> - Add support for bonds, VLAN, and wifi with wpasupplicant+networkd (#1616928)

 15:10 <pitti> - -Correctly handle DHCP defaults in NM (#1617051)

 15:10 <pitti> - Read config from /lib/netplan/ for policies shipped in packages

 15:10 <pitti> - initramfs: Fix rootdelay interpretation (#1615751)

 15:14 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:15 <pitti> I get about 50 kB/s from archive.ubuntu.com (normally about 2.5 MB/s)..

 15:15 <xnox> actually email was from caribou, not from chiluk....

 15:15 <cyphermox> pitti: it's not just you

 15:15 <xnox> short week - monday was a bank holiday

 15:15 <xnox> finished all the zua feature work for now, all up to date in the ppa

 15:15 <xnox> helping fixing adt tests in openstack things, to fix s390x regressions (in progress, some will land with b3 uploads)

 15:15 <xnox> gpg2 -> gpg transition

 15:15 <xnox> ..

 15:15 <cyphermox> wha?

 15:15 <cyphermox> oh, nvm

 15:15 <pitti> he meant "<-" :)

 15:15 <cyphermox> he may have meant just dropping the 2.

 15:15 <pitti> oh, you meant renaming

 15:16 * xnox meant just dropping the 2 =)

 15:16 <cyphermox> wee

 15:16 <cyphermox> that means I can remove some scripts here.

 15:16 <xnox> gpg is now gpg2, gpg2 is now symlink to gpg

 15:16 <pitti> let's all discuss for 15 minutes which direction the arrow should be

 15:16 * pitti can kill his ~/bin/gpg symlink \o/

 15:16 <cyphermox> yeah

 15:16 <cyphermox> now the yubikey GPG magic is a first-class citizen

 15:17 <robru> lp:bileto

 15:17 <robru> - git support (in production but busted pending firewall fixes)

 15:17 <robru> - ignore no-change rebuilds in dest archive

 15:17 <robru> - ephemeral PPAs (in production but not usable yet)

 15:17 <robru> (done)

 15:18 <pitti> robru: oh, you are trying git clones from a ProdStack instance?

 15:18 <robru> pitti: git fetching and pushing, but yes

 15:18 <pitti> robru: (I banged my head on teh wall about that for too long and gave up)

 15:18 <robru> pitti: is there some secret?

 15:18 <pitti> robru: I do it in scalingstack instances now

 15:18 <robru> pitti: there is simply no giving up, we need this

 15:18 <pitti> PS is too annoyingly paranoid

 15:18 <cyphermox> robru: "- ignore no-change rebuilds in dest archive"  how do you do that?

 15:18 <pitti> Laney has discussed something like this with IS for ages

 15:19 <pitti> no sil2100 either

 15:20 <robru> cyphermox: we download the DSC of the latest version in trunk's changelog, and then we download the DSC of the latest version in distro, debdiff them, and filterdiff out debian/changelog. if the result is an empty file, we ignore that. if the result has nonzero size, we report the error (preventing publication), and insist the user sync this change back to

 15:20 <robru> trunk and rebuild.

 15:20 <cyphermox> ah, right

 15:20 <pitti> ♪ where have all the developers gone? long time passing ♪ ♫

 15:21 <Laney> pitti: robru: If you just need a whitelist of domains, you can get IS to add that for you in squid

 15:22 <Laney> assuming HTTP

 15:22 <Laney> for git://, dunno

 15:22 <robru> Laney: no we specifically need fetching and pushing for git+ssh

 15:22 <tdaitx> so, any easy way to deal with a package that requires autoconf-2.13 when that autoconf generates stuff don't work on gcc6?

 15:22 <pitti> tdaitx: ugh, 2.*13*?

 15:22 <pitti> I didn't know that dinosaurs were still alive :)

 15:23 <tdaitx> yeah, the package/project has not seem an update in quite a few years

 15:23 <pitti> (autoconf 2.13 released in 1998 :) )

 15:23 <pitti> tdaitx: remove-package ?

 15:24 <tdaitx> you tell me =)

 15:25 <pitti> oh dear, firefox and thunderbird use it

 15:25 <pitti> they didn't even exist yet when 2.13 was already obsolete..

 15:25 <pitti> tdaitx: so, I'm afraid everything will be "not easy" at this point :(

 15:26 <Laney> does it really require 2.13?

 15:26 <pitti> tdaitx: best might be to not run autoconf2.13 at boot, but have a good old debian/patches/99_autotools.pathc with the pregenerated stuff

 15:26 <Laney> convert to something more modern :)

 15:26 <pitti> tdaitx: and then maybe some extra 99.1_autoconf2.13_quirks.patch to fiddle with Makefile.in to work with gcc-6

 15:26 <pitti> but obviously, converting to 2.50 is best ;)

 15:27 <tdaitx> well, I can't regenerate anything there with a newer autoconf, I would have to update it

 15:27 <pitti> regenerate with 2.13, I mean

 15:27 <pitti> tdaitx: which package are we talknig about, btw?

 15:27 <tdaitx> pitti, mozart

 15:27 <pitti> we should at least yell at  upstream about that

 15:27 <pitti> this is like "don't build me"

 15:32 <tdaitx> pitti, meh, I was stupid to trust the launchpad page, it says "Mozart — Content Management Framework based on JAVA.", but control file has "Mozart Programming System"

 15:32 <tdaitx> the programming system is now at mozart 2.0, 1.4 is not being used any longer

 15:33 <tdaitx> the mozart content management framework is dead, doesn't even have a project page any longer

 15:34 <pitti> any other business?

 15:34 <pitti> let's formally close this

 15:34 <pitti> #endmeeting
