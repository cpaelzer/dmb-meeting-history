 10:17:10 <head_victim> #chairs ejat Destine lifeless

 10:17:46 <head_victim> happyaron doesn't appear to be here?

 10:17:55 <head_victim> #chair ejat Destine lifeless

 10:17:55 <meetingology> Current chairs: Destine ejat head_victim lifeless

 10:18:27 <Destine> head_victim, happyaron does not have to be now. He is for renewal.

 10:18:35 <head_victim> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/AsiaOceania

 10:18:46 <head_victim> Destine: good point, I'll shoot them an email if everyone is ok with that?

 10:18:58 <ejat> go by ashickur-noor 1st ?

 10:19:07 <head_victim> #action head_victim to email happyaron and advise self renewal acceptable

 10:19:07 * meetingology head_victim to email happyaron and advise self renewal acceptable

 10:19:08 <ashickur-noor> I am ready

 10:19:15 <Destine> head_victim, and Community council said renewal can be done automatically.

 10:19:17 <Destine> ashickur-noor, ok.

 10:19:20 <head_victim> #topic ashickur-noor

 10:20:06 <head_victim> So we're going to try and be quick to get through them all, we will have time to give more detailed feedback after the meeting. Just so you all don't feel like we're being too short we want to get through the 4 applicants in the remaining time

 10:20:24 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: so I see you have organised some gatherings since you last application (last month wasn't it?)

 10:20:32 <ashickur-noor> yes

 10:20:43 <head_victim> That is exactly the sort of activity we like to see.

 10:21:07 <ashickur-noor> ya I understood it on last meeting

 10:22:03 <ashickur-noor> And when you give me confirmation that any body can arrange Ubuntu program I start to plan for that

 10:22:28 <head_victim> So that ticks the significant activity (I would like to see it written up better perhaps as not everyone would be on the same mailing lists) , but I personally would like to see the sustained aspect. So basically continue with what you're doing for a cycle or so is my recommendation.

 10:22:32 <ashickur-noor> to gather our Old and new community people

 10:22:54 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: I've never known restrictions on who can and cant' do what as long as the Code of Conduct is followed.

 10:23:11 <ashickur-noor> I know that

 10:23:12 <head_victim> Do any of the other board members have questions?

 10:24:08 <ashickur-noor> But I told in last meeting that some one has face problem to organize program by using Ubuntu name

 10:24:54 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: I don't understand that issue, perhaps we can talk in more depth at the conclusion of the meeting or perhaps on the loco-contacts mailing list?

 10:25:05 <lifeless> http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy

 10:25:08 <lifeless> is likely the thing

 10:25:25 <head_victim> lifeless: yes but anyone can organise an event to promote ubuntu as long as the CoC is followed

 10:25:35 <lifeless> CoC & TM policy

 10:26:04 <lifeless> but yes; my point is merely that ashickur-noor *can* do things as long as following the (simple) rules

 10:26:19 <head_victim> lifeless: agreed and also OT for this meeting.

 10:26:22 <ashickur-noor> I need some break

 10:26:30 <head_victim> #voters lifeless Destine ejat head_victim

 10:26:30 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine ejat head_victim lifeless

 10:31:49 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: I think you've shown effort in your contributions but I would like to see them sustained and some better documented evidence (I realise you're gone now but you can read this when you return to the scren)

 10:32:48 <Destine> ashickur-noor, i think you'd better come back a bit latter to ensure sustained effort.

 10:33:07 <lifeless> ashickur-noor: similar from me; its great you are getting involved, and if you keep doing some regular local meetings I'm sure you'll be granted membership easily

 10:33:19 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: and more than willing to go through some more feedback after the meeting or via email especially about any resistence you're finding to holding events.

 10:33:38 <head_victim> #topic MinSikCHO

 10:34:05 <minsikcho> ok.. me now...

 10:34:14 <head_victim> minsikcho: hi there, can you please give us a couple of sentences to introduce yourself? I'm Jared so I am the one responding via email so I know where you're coming from but others may not.

 10:34:48 <ejat> minsikcho : a part of android translation .. anything else u do contribute to ubuntu ?

 10:35:02 <minsikcho> Umm. to introduce myself briefly, i'm a teen in Korea, and I'm attending at international school..

 10:35:56 <minsikcho> About android, I translated ADW. Launcher, and desk notes, which former one was done by changing strings.xml, and last one by web client.. They are all listed as official translation for korean android market :)

 10:36:22 <ejat> sorry for that … minsikcho : are u joing the korean loco team ? or doing the Ubuntu translation at launchpad ?

 10:36:50 <minsikcho> ejat: yes i'm at korean loco and korean translators for ubuntu, ubuntu translation @ launchpad

 10:37:13 <head_victim> minsikcho: ok looking at your wiki page and the mailing list questions, I just want to let you know Ubuntu Membership is a reward as such for significant and sustained contributions to Ubuntu. It's not so that you can start work on it, anyone can work on Ubuntu with or without membership.

 10:37:35 <minsikcho> other than translations, i'm trying to spread words about ubuntu in Korea, which windows has almost 7-80% of share

 10:37:36 <ejat> because i saw u just join it ..

 10:38:03 <minsikcho> ejat: yup i consider that as drawbacks of myself..

 10:39:31 <ejat> and all the karma collection just 3 days ago … btw .. its a good start :)

 10:39:45 <minsikcho> before i went to loco translation team, i didn't know that i should go through some limit to translate. So, i saw my translations were just showed 'suggestion' or something

 10:40:01 <head_victim> minsikcho: I agree you're going about joining in the community well. I'm ready to vote

 10:40:13 <Destine> head_victim, ready too.

 10:41:19 <head_victim> Anyone else have any questions for minsikcho ?

 10:41:52 <head_victim> #vote If board members can please vote on minsikcho's Ubuntu Membership when ready

 10:41:52 <meetingology> Please vote on: If board members can please vote on minsikcho's Ubuntu Membership when ready

 10:43:03 <head_victim> +0 I think you are making really good inroads into the community. Ubuntu membership however requires significant and sustained contributions to the community. So if you continue as you are then I would suggest keeping documentation on your efforts, getting some of your team members to give you testimonials and reapply in a cycle or so.

 10:44:17 <meetingology> Motion denied

 10:44:57 <head_victim> minsikcho: you're starting out right, just keep at it :) Ubuntu Membership is given to those who have already contributed though, not those about to start.

 10:45:07 <minsikcho> ok :) thanks for evaluating my contributions on ubuntu :) i strongly believe that it will be a nice motive for me to keep working :)

 10:45:31 <head_victim> We're on a tight schedule so if you want further feedback please either email the board or hang around after the meeting, we're more than willing to help just trying to get through the applications tongiht :)

 10:45:38 <Destine> minsikcho, keep up your good work and come back.

 10:45:52 <minsikcho> destine: yes :)

 10:46:00 <head_victim> Actually,

 10:46:08 <head_victim> I can't see either kokoye or bonepyaesone here

 10:46:34 <Destine> head_victim, can you read kokoye's wiki? can you paste it to us?

 10:46:37 <lifeless> 23:46 [freenode] -!- There is no such nick kokoye2007

 10:47:03 <lifeless> 23:46 [freenode] -!- There is no such nick boneyaesone

 10:47:03 <lifeless> 23:46 [freenode] -!- There is no such nick Bone_Pyae

 10:47:07 <lifeless> so neither are online

 10:47:15 <head_victim> Destine: actually, I haven't been able to read it myself. It's possible that it's in a language I don't have installed

 10:47:20 <ejat> shall we adjoint/end the meeting ?

 10:47:34 * ejat too cant read it ..

 10:47:45 <Destine> head_victim, that's ...

 10:48:51 <head_victim> Well, if ashickur-noor or minsikcho wanted further feedback we can use the next 5 - 10 mins for that if they'd like.

 10:49:04 <ashickur-noor> Yap

 10:49:05 <head_victim> Anyone upset if I endmeeting?

 10:49:06 <ashickur-noor> I want

 10:50:16 <Destine> ashickur-noor, go ahead.

 10:50:46 <M0hi> Destine: I think he needs some feedback from the board

 10:51:15 <ashickur-noor> I want to know who can give me testimonials

 10:51:57 <Destine> ashickur-noor, someone who is preferably a Member and who knows you well about you work.

 10:51:58 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: basically with your application, I believe you're starting to do the right things. For Ubuntu Membership the requirements are listed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership and require sustained commitment

 10:52:06 <M0hi> ashickur-noor: People who know about your contributions can write you a testimonial. It will be having credits if you have testimonials from the Ubuntu community

 10:52:15 <lifeless> I'm sure there are other Ubuntu members in bangladesh

 10:52:32 <ejat> agreed with lifeless

 10:52:45 <lifeless> if you get to know them, and they see how you are contributing to Ubuntu, they may give you a testimonial

 10:52:57 <head_victim> But yes, having people validate your efforts always helps. If they can say " ashickur-noor was the main organiser of the event where x number of people got together and socialised/installed/etc about Ubuntu" that would be perfect.

 10:53:12 <ejat> gtg …. catch up with u guys later … thanks to every one who join the meeting .. .

 10:53:15 <minsikcho> do they are required to be ubuntu members, or other ubuntu contributors or also allowed?

 10:53:16 <ashickur-noor> frankly speaking Our Community members are soo busy

 10:53:37 <ashickur-noor> they don't have much time to do so

 10:54:06 <head_victim> minsikcho: don't have to be, but are preferred because other Ubuntu members have already been through the process so understand what is required.

 10:54:14 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: offer to help them out :)

 10:54:45 <Destine> ashickur-noor, or talking to them about the importance.

 10:54:49 <minsikcho> head_victim: is there like a list of people on the membership?

 10:55:08 <head_victim> minsikcho: you seem keen on translations, surely there are translators in your LoCo that are members?

 10:55:29 <Destine> minsikcho, Yes, on the wikipage you registered yourself.

 10:55:40 <head_victim> Also, translation efforts are easier to quatify on launchpad, we can see what karma you have from translations which helps (it's not the only thing we look for but is another indicator)

 10:56:00 <minsikcho> yes mostly translations :)

 10:56:11 <minsikcho> head_victim: got a findout :)

 10:56:34 <ashickur-noor> Can any body give me some idea how can I contribute more?

 10:56:38 <lifeless> I gotta run; keep strong - we welcome your involvement as it is, membership has a moderately high bar because we don't want it to be something folk quickly 'earn' and then wander away

 10:56:50 <lifeless> gnight all

 10:57:02 <Destine> lifeless, gnite.

 10:57:03 <head_victim> minsikcho: for example if you look at my launchpad profile - https://launchpad.net/~jarednorris/+karma - you can see that I've contributed 16020 translations

 10:57:18 <head_victim> Sure I've got it easy, I use an English based language

 10:57:28 <head_victim> But it does break down your karma into components.

 10:58:01 <head_victim> ashickur-noor: depends on how you want to contribute, are you a loco organiser, a translator, a developer, a bug triager or something else entirely?

 10:58:28 <head_victim> Oops, never ended the meeting

 10:58:30 <head_victim> #endmeeting
