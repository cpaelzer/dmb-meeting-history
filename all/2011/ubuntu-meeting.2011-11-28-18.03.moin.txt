 18:03:52 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 18:04:02 <jdstrand> Thank you to jamespage for preparing updates for jenkins last week! :)

 18:04:16 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:04:20 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:04:30 <jdstrand> it looks surprisingly like last week

 18:04:45 <jdstrand> though I am in the happy place this week

 18:04:55 <jdstrand> I am almost caught up on email from the holiday weekend

 18:05:01 <jdstrand> I have some pending updates

 18:05:06 <jdstrand> MIR audits

 18:05:14 <jdstrand> and more statistics gathering on proactive and reactive work as have time

 18:05:20 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 18:05:36 <mdeslaur> I just published some apt and update-manager updates

 18:05:37 * jdstrand also poke at the aa-profiles work

 18:05:47 <mdeslaur> and have some other updates to attend to this week

 18:06:36 <mdeslaur> I'm also on triage

 18:06:43 <mdeslaur> and plan on looking at apparmor app confinement

 18:06:47 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 18:06:49 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're it

 18:07:00 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place again this week

 18:07:31 <sbeattie> I'm still poking at cgroups and have some updates on my plate as well.

 18:07:51 <sbeattie> ... in addition to recovering from the holiday and catching up on email.

 18:08:03 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me. micahg?

 18:09:18 <micahg> I'm still catching up on updates, hopefully will be caught up by the end of the week with immediate updates (Thunderbird, NSS, chromium), Thunderbird 8 went out finally :), I think that's it, tyhicks?

 18:09:36 <tyhicks> I'm handling the community role this week

 18:09:52 <tyhicks> I have a short week as I'm off on Friday

 18:10:32 <tyhicks> I didn't make much progress on the t1lib update from last week, as patches don't seem to be available

 18:10:53 <tyhicks> I'm currently working on another (private) update

 18:11:27 <tyhicks> and I've got to get an eCryptfs kernel patch out to lkml sometime early this week to incorporate some feedback from Linus

 18:11:38 <tyhicks> thats it for me - jjohansen?

 18:12:06 <jdstrand> jjohansen is off today. I don't think he'll be in the meeting

 18:12:39 <jdstrand> so, I know jjohansen has a short week, will continue with kernel updates and is working on essential apparmor work items

 18:12:49 <jdstrand> let's move on

 18:12:51 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
