 15:01:51 <skaet> hmm... just had a cut paste failure.   Will recreate and paste at end of meeting.

 15:02:10 * stgraber waves

 15:02:35 <skaet> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReleaseTeam/Meeting/2011-08-19

 15:03:04 <skaet> basically concern right now on the number of regression bugs as critical/high at this stage.

 15:03:09 <skaet> but ... more later

 15:03:39 <skaet> any questions/issues before starting in to round table?

 15:03:42 <skaet> ..

 15:03:45 * NCommander arrives (sorry Im late)

 15:03:58 <skaet> [TOPIC] Hardware Certification team update - mlegris

 15:03:58 <meetingology> TOPIC: Hardware Certification team update - mlegris

 15:04:22 <skaet> or brendand?

 15:04:40 <mlegris> [Week 33 Testing Report]

 15:04:40 * hggdh waves

 15:04:49 <mlegris> A3 Testing finished on Wednesday, finished ~140 systems

 15:04:55 <mlegris> [link] http://people.canonical.com/~hwcert/oneiric-testing/oneiric_alpha3.html

 15:04:58 <mlegris> .

 15:05:02 <mlegris> * 37 Oneiric related bugs reported

 15:05:09 <mlegris> * 25 are HW specific

 15:05:14 <mlegris> * 17 Checkbox bugs reported

 15:05:35 <mlegris> (oneiric caused some havoc with our testing suite)

 15:06:00 <mlegris> Next week will be the normal weekly testing

 15:06:02 <mlegris> ..

 15:06:27 <skaet> Thanks mlegris!

 15:07:19 <skaet> Are there some bugs you consider blockers for B1 that you want extra focus on?

 15:08:39 <mlegris> most of the hw bugs are blockers for us

 15:08:58 <mlegris> vanhoof has been doing a great job looking into those

 15:09:30 <mlegris> fyi: bugs with blocks-hwcert are our high priority bugs

 15:09:49 <skaet> mlegris,  thanks.   I'll follow up early next week on some of the specifics then.

 15:09:58 <skaet> any other questions?

 15:09:58 <mlegris> great, thanks!

 15:10:33 <skaet> [TOPIC] Security team update - jdstrand

 15:10:33 <meetingology> TOPIC: Security team update - jdstrand

 15:10:59 <jdstrand> hello :)

 15:11:02 <skaet> :)

 15:11:10 <jdstrand> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/ReleaseStatus/Oneiric

 15:11:11 <jdstrand> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/canonical-security.html

 15:11:21 <jdstrand> We are back on track for our assigned work items in our blueprints as can be seen in our trend line. Most of the remaining work items are either not tied to the release or are bug fixes.

 15:11:30 <jdstrand> One notable exception is apparmor mediation of dbus. As mentioned in #ubuntu-release a while ago, we are hoping to have a tech preview available for Oneiric that defaults to off (ie, dbus meditation is turned off by default and it behaves like normal).

 15:11:34 <jdstrand> Work is ongoing, but this may slip, at which point we should have something when 'P' opens.

 15:11:43 <jdstrand> Looking at the list of oneiric bugs, I don't see anything else worth highlighting.

 15:11:49 <jdstrand> ..

 15:12:02 <skaet> Thanks jdstrand!  any questions?

 15:12:20 <skaet> [TOPIC] Kernel team update - ogasawara

 15:12:20 <meetingology> TOPIC: Kernel team update - ogasawara

 15:12:26 <ogasawara> Overall status is reported at the first link below.  Burn down for Oneiric Beta-1 is at the second link below.  Burndown for the cycle is at the third link:

 15:12:26 <ogasawara> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/ReleaseStatus/Oneiric

 15:12:26 <ogasawara> [LINK] http://people.canonical.com/~platform/workitems/oneiric/canonical-kernel-team-ubuntu-11.10-beta-1.html

 15:12:26 <ogasawara> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/group/topic-oneiric-kernel-tasks.html

 15:12:38 <ogasawara> Last week we uploaded the Ubuntu 3.0.0-8.11 kernel which was rebased onto upstream stable v3.0.1.  Since then upstream stable v3.0.2 and v3.0.3 have released.  We've rebased and plan to upload today.  We intend this to be our final upload prior to Beta-1.  We are currently trending slightly above our Beta-1 burndown chart but are below overall.  The remaining work items are not release critical.

 15:12:59 <ogasawara> Of the bugs called out on the agenda against the kernel, status is as follows:

 15:13:06 <ogasawara> #542660: looks to be related to EFI boot not loading the video bios into ram.

 15:13:06 <ogasawara> #557261: updated logs attached, investigation ongoing.

 15:13:06 <ogasawara> #708286: assigned to kernel dev, awaiting feedback for test kernel.

 15:13:06 <ogasawara> #754711: on a 3.0 oneiric kernel, system now suspends but doesn't resume.  systemtap debug scripts to help investigate are being worked on for Oneiric, see 815944 (systemtap fix recently posted upstream).

 15:13:07 <ogasawara> #758486: updated debug information attached, investigation ongoing.

 15:13:09 <ogasawara> #760131: partly fixed in Oneiric and soon natty, more analysis ongoing upstream.

 15:13:11 <ogasawara> #784937: Fix Committed.

 15:13:13 <ogasawara> #790712: the order 5 allocation seems to be bogus and non-fatal; further investigation ongoing.

 15:13:15 <ogasawara> #791850: Fix Committed.

 15:13:17 <ogasawara> #793486: the requested debug info has been attached, likely going to require a bisect.

 15:13:28 <ogasawara> Questions?

 15:13:29 <ogasawara> ..

 15:13:52 <skaet> Thanks ogasawara!   Nice seeing those fix committeds :)

 15:14:25 <skaet> [TOPIC] Foundations team update - cjwatson

 15:14:25 <meetingology> TOPIC: Foundations team update - cjwatson

 15:14:42 <cjwatson> hi

 15:14:45 <skaet> :)

 15:14:48 <cjwatson> Evan landed his Ubiquity FFe; now using PyGI and GTK+ 3.

 15:14:49 <cjwatson> Code to switch over to new reduced DVD images committed, but I haven't quite got a successful build out of it yet due to archive inconsistency.

 15:14:52 <cjwatson> Working on testing and client-side scripting for new native source sync facility in Launchpad; review is nearly complete and this should be available to developers soon.

 15:15:00 <cjwatson> Much work on trying to sort out component-mismatches and NBS.  component-mismatches is looking rather better now (thanks doko and others!), but NBS is still a swamp (and many of these correspond to build failures).  Please help if you can.

 15:15:04 <cjwatson> Multiarch turned on by default on amd64 upgrades, and ia32-libs cut down quite a bit.  Steve plans to remove it entirely at the start of the P cycle.  \o/

 15:15:08 <cjwatson> Bugs: Still a bit of a swamp, but we should be able to make more progress now that the giant ubiquity update has landed (most of the milestoned bugs are installer problems of one kind or another).

 15:15:12 <cjwatson> * 597673: Started work on constructing a suitable test environment.

 15:15:14 <cjwatson> * 702283: This may or may not happen - it's Medium, and a lot of hard work.

 15:15:18 <cjwatson> Others are queued; I think we should be able to address at least the High ones (745960, 819624, 820514) by beta freeze.  756147 is not ours, as noted in the bug (although I've retried the build anyway since doko said it should be fixed with the current toolchain).

 15:15:22 <cjwatson> ..

 15:15:50 <skaet> Thanks cjwatson!

 15:16:44 <skaet> any one have specific questions?

 15:17:01 * skaet just cross checked and spotted her answer in status :)

 15:17:19 <doko> filed ~80 ftbfs reports for main

 15:17:28 <doko> universe rebuild is still running

 15:17:47 <skaet> doko - what was the change that triggered the ~80ftbfs

 15:17:49 <doko> http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-20110816-oneiric.html

 15:18:03 <doko> skaet, nothing particular

 15:18:09 <ogra_> wow, why does that differ so much from http://qa.ubuntuwire.org/ftbfs/

 15:18:19 <ogra_> (has only 16 packages failing for main)

 15:18:25 <doko> we just didn't upload everything in oneiric

 15:18:29 <ogra_> ah

 15:18:55 <doko> thanks to wgrant to adding bug numbers to this page

 15:18:59 <skaet> doko,  when I looked last night it was down in the 20s...

 15:19:20 <doko> skaet, well, the rebuild is running, it was then just one day building ...

 15:20:37 <skaet> doko,  ok,  will see where things are on monday then.

 15:20:54 <skaet> thanks

 15:21:23 <doko> currently we have around ~10 universe builds running/hour

 15:22:53 <skaet> ok,  I'll just add a request to each of the teams to have a look at the ftbfs list and help clean up the packages they're tracking.

 15:23:12 <doko> thanks!

 15:34:01 <jibel> ..

 15:34:03 <jibel> any question ?

 15:34:06 <jibel> or comment

 15:34:21 <skaet> thanks jibel!  good data.

 15:34:40 <skaet> I'm worried about the #of critical/high regressions I was seeing yesterday too.

 15:35:27 * skaet looks around for questions...

 15:35:41 <skaet> [TOPIC] Desktop Team update - pitti

 15:35:41 <meetingology> TOPIC: Desktop Team update - pitti

 15:35:50 <pitti> GNOME 3.1.5 mostly landed except for three remaining packages.

 15:35:53 <pitti> Landed some high-urgency fixes in unity which cause a lot of crashes and other grief on Friday.

 15:35:58 <pitti> We currently have a harder decision to make about whether or not to update pygobject to 2.90 (i. e. future 3.0). See bug 828751 for details and pro/con.

 15:35:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 828751 in pygobject (Ubuntu) "[FFE] update pygobject to 2.90.1" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/828751

 15:36:01 <pitti> pygobject to 2.90 (i. e. future 3.0). See bug 828751 for details and pro/con.

 15:36:03 <pitti> Lots of bug fixing this week.

 15:36:05 <pitti> Still swamped by too many "last mile" work items for 90% done specs, and a large bug backlog.

 15:36:09 <pitti> RC bug status: on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/ReleaseStatus#rcbugs as usual

 15:36:12 <pitti> nothing earthshattering there, biggest issue for derivatives is bug 789333, which just started being worked on

 15:36:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 789333 in policykit-1-gnome (Ubuntu Oneiric) "users-admin crashes on start because of mixed GTK2 and 3 symbols" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/789333

 15:36:17 <pitti> other than that we have lots of non-RC bugs which in sum spoil the experience, but that's not a good matter to track here

 15:36:23 <pitti> ..

 15:36:38 <skaet> Thanks pitti!

 15:36:57 <skaet> will work with you off line to prune down the list.

 15:37:35 <Ursinha_> 17

 15:37:37 <Ursinha_> sorry

 15:37:58 <skaet> and thanks to robert ansell,  for fixing alot of the lightdm bugs,  that should unblock some of the other teams.

 15:38:50 <skaet> [TOPIC] Desktop Experience Team Update - dbarth

 15:38:50 <meetingology> TOPIC: Desktop Experience Team Update - dbarth

 15:38:51 <pitti> ecryptfs started working agian today

 15:39:15 <skaet> :)

 15:39:28 <dbarth> yup

 15:39:31 <dbarth> so

 15:39:44 <dbarth> the report as usual https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/OneiricReleaseStatus

 15:39:50 <dbarth> highlights:

 15:40:07 <dbarth> - a new weekly release of unity, with IM support and lots of bug fixes

 15:40:16 <dbarth> (including some out of release fixed since this morning)

 15:40:56 <dbarth> - alt-tab fixes as well, to make it more usable

 15:41:29 <dbarth> ('xcept on my machine which is running devl, so bear with me)

 15:41:51 <dbarth> a good series of indicator updates, the front is stable there now

 15:42:44 <dbarth> unity-2d missed the weekly upload, but Florian is working with seb128 now; catching up with missing views

 15:43:13 <dbarth> compiz: reshuffle of the branches to realign upstream with what's in oneiric

 15:43:29 <dbarth> the uwd rewrite branch is tracked independently now

 15:43:39 <dbarth> last : CJK status

 15:44:09 <dbarth> the xapian patch is now well tested by OEM

 15:44:30 <dbarth> and ibus support is mostly there, with IM support first this week, and multicontext ie ibus next week now

 15:44:35 <dbarth> ..

 15:44:43 <skaet> thanks dbarth!

 15:44:49 <dbarth> (sorry that was a bit slow)

 15:45:28 <skaet> when will the next drop be?  (wednesday?)

 15:47:44 <skaet> hmm..  will move on then and follow up with him offline.

 15:47:47 <dbarth> skaet: thursday?

 15:47:58 <jibel> o/

 15:47:59 <dbarth> why wednesday? am i missing a milestone?

 15:48:22 <skaet> dbarth, plan was for the drops to land on wednesday.

 15:48:32 <skaet> we'll be entering beta freeze on tuesday

 15:48:37 <skaet> s/tuesday/thursday

 15:48:44 <dbarth> when approaching milestones

 15:49:11 <skaet> yeah beta 1 is sept 1.   so its approaching.

 15:49:13 <skaet> :)

 15:49:19 <dbarth> uh, right, ok

 15:49:21 <dbarth> yes

 15:49:32 <skaet> thanks.

 15:49:35 <skaet> go jibel

 15:49:51 <jibel> dbarth, on DX team's bugs on radar list, I see no reference to 'video corruption' issues

 15:49:56 <jibel> there are many convergent reports showing problems there

 15:50:01 <jibel> What's the status (unless it's on another team's hands) ?

 15:50:32 <dbarth> i have no status update on it yet; jay is investigating it, but it's mostly at the driver level

 15:51:41 <jibel> do you expect improvements/fixes before B1 ?

 15:51:48 <pitti> jibel: for the corrupted popup windows? or still with external screens?

 15:51:56 <dbarth> ah that's different

 15:52:15 <dbarth> the corrupted popups are fixed

 15:52:17 <dbarth> or have a fix

 15:52:34 <pitti> ah, great; they are quite irritating

 15:52:35 <dbarth> the video issues are more related to fglrx problems

 15:52:41 <jibel> pitti, external (e.g bug 824099) and screen corruption on fglrx

 15:52:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 824099 in compiz (Ubuntu Oneiric) "[~30 systems] Plugging in external monitor to VGA port makes both displays corrupted with thick slanted lines" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/824099

 15:54:13 <dbarth> yes, i'm aware of this one

 15:54:24 <dbarth> but we don't have an answer at this point

 15:54:44 <jibel> ok, thanks

 15:56:07 <skaet> ok,   not seeing any other questions,  so moving on.

 15:57:43 <meetingology> TOPIC: Edubuntu Team update - stgraber or highvoltage

 15:57:50 <stgraber> hey everyone!

 15:57:53 <skaet> :)

 15:58:09 <stgraber> ok, so really not that much on the Edubuntu side, mostly because highvoltage is quite busy and I've been traveling lately.

 15:58:21 <stgraber> our images build fine which is always nice to have

 15:58:53 <stgraber> I'm hoping to get the initial work done on LTSP live next week so we can file the FFe and solve our last big bug

 15:59:13 <Daviey> stgraber: do you have any work involved in the ubiquity transition?

 15:59:28 <Daviey> The pygi changes?

 15:59:31 <stgraber> we also have a small problem with some of the tools we ship no longer working with gnome3 that we'll probably have to drop

 15:59:59 <stgraber> Daviey: I haven't looked at it yet, but we don't use custom widgets or simular for our steps, so if we need to port them to gi, it should be fairly easy

 16:00:20 <Daviey> super

 16:00:21 <stgraber> so it's pretty likely we'll be dropping sabayon, pessulus and nanny this cycle

 16:00:34 <stgraber> just need to review them once more but last we checked they weren't gnome3/dconf aware

 16:00:52 <stgraber> and the Edubuntu team won't have the time to port them all (especially as we aren't the upstream for these, gnome is)

 16:01:01 <stgraber> I guess that's all for Edubuntu

 16:01:02 <stgraber> any question?

 16:01:28 <skaet> Thanks stgraber!

 16:01:47 <stgraber> oh

 16:01:47 <stgraber> ..

 16:01:49 <stgraber> :)

 16:04:11 <gilir> hi :)

 16:04:15 <skaet> :)

 16:04:19 <gilir> Not much to report this week

 16:04:29 <gilir> We focused on merging bugfix releases/revisions from Debian, and updating bugfix releases from upstream.

 16:04:44 <gilir> Working on lightdm switch by default, configuration is working (setting session and greeter by default), but still crashing on upgrade (maybe relative to bug #829514))

 16:04:45 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 829514 could not be found

 16:04:54 <gilir> For next week:

 16:05:04 <gilir> - The new theme should be uploaded, + some community wallpapers

 16:05:13 <gilir> - Finishing merging bugfix releases/revisions from upstream and Debian

 16:05:22 <gilir> - Re-enable lightdm by default on daily, test and decide before the freeze if we keep it

 16:05:29 <gilir> ..

 16:05:57 <skaet> Thanks gilir,  I don't have that bug on my list.  Is the number accurate?

 16:06:12 * skaet sees lauchpad can't find it either ;)

 16:06:33 <gilir> I just reported it recently, and still private for retracing

 16:06:46 <skaet> gilir,  coolio.   Thanks!

 16:07:00 <skaet> any questions?

 16:07:10 <jibel> gilir, you'll wait for a while, there's no retracer

 16:08:34 <tumbleweed> hi

 16:08:38 <skaet> :)

 16:08:40 <tumbleweed> Since freeze, people have been concentrating on FTBFS \o/

 16:08:40 <tumbleweed> http://corelli.tumbleweed.org.za/ubuntu-qa/qa-ftbfs/oneiric-historical.html (I really must get that in good shape for ubuntuwire...)

 16:08:50 <tumbleweed> I suspect we'll see many more in doko's rebuild

 16:08:50 <tumbleweed> Still lots of NBS/transition work to do too

 16:09:03 * skaet nods

 16:09:04 <tumbleweed> No sign of the eclipse FFe that micahg mentioned, yet

 16:09:17 <tumbleweed> I tried to politely enforce FFes for the dh_python2 transitions, but that hasn't achieved much. One incomplete FFe, and a response of ~ "I'd like to do these without bureaucracy, please" :/

 16:09:50 <tumbleweed> that's all from me

 16:09:51 <tumbleweed> ..

 16:10:37 <skaet> thanks tumbleweed!   can you send me more details offline about the FFe?

 16:11:10 <tumbleweed> sure

 16:11:14 <skaet> thanks!

 16:11:21 <skaet> any other questions?

 16:11:33 <meetingology> TOPIC: Server team update - Daviey

 16:11:39 <Daviey> o/

 16:11:41 <skaet> :)

 16:11:42 <Daviey> Hi, things are looking pretty good!

 16:11:42 <Daviey> Since the last meeting, lots of openstack and it's depends have entered main.  There are a few issues blocking swift/glance promotion, but these have been identified and on target to be resolved.

 16:11:46 <Daviey> python-carrot promotion is currently on hold, as we are hoping to replace it with python-kombu which is requiring ongoing work in upstream.

 16:11:49 <Daviey> We also have an initial armel cloud image, which is undergoing testing (HINT: it doesn't yet work)..  but it is there, and a reproducible build (added complexity).

 16:11:52 <Daviey> eucalyptus (now universe) is currently in a poor state, with nobody seemingly actively working on it.  Upgrade path from natty is currently concerning.

 16:11:55 <Daviey> Bugs we are currently tracking for Oneiric release. (Including FFe's, FTBFS's, MIR's and general bugs)

 16:11:58 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:12:01 <Daviey> Burndown overview looks a little off par, but i believe it became out of date this week - we are working to fix the status now.

 16:12:04 <Daviey> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/group/topic-oneiric-server-overview.html

 16:12:07 <Daviey> (As ever, if there are any I am not tracking, please raise them either now or as soon as possible).

 16:12:10 <Daviey> There are still some FFe bugs which need raising, and they are being addresses as soon as possible.

 16:12:13 <Daviey> Thanks!

 16:12:15 <Daviey> ...

 16:12:53 <skaet> Thanks Daviey!    Will look into those links a bit more after the meeting.

 16:13:03 <skaet> anyone have questions right now for Daviey?

 16:13:39 <tumbleweed> Daviey: any response with getting kombu in thorugh debian?

 16:14:15 <Daviey> tumbleweed: That is entirely blocked on ampqlib >1.0 which is a depends

 16:14:20 <tumbleweed> ah, right

 16:14:24 <Daviey> That needs resolving in Ubuntu & Debian before that can happen.

 16:14:38 <ScottK> skaet: Here now.

 16:14:44 <Daviey> tumbleweed: Don't worry, we will push back :)

 16:15:25 <skaet> ScottK,  coolio.  ok, will have you go next before we wrap up.

 16:15:28 <tumbleweed> Daviey: I promised to help out on the debian side in the FFe bug, but just hadn't seen any activity

 16:15:55 <Daviey> tumbleweed: Yeah, wanted to get the the depends resolved first.

 16:16:10 <Daviey> tumbleweed: Appreciate your offer to help.. will keep you posted!

 16:16:22 <tumbleweed> np, thanks

 16:16:52 <ScottK> Hello.

 16:17:33 <ScottK> Currently working through FTBFS from the rebuild test and looking at how much plasma-active work it's reasonable to land post FF.

 16:17:53 <ScottK> I expect a couple of FFes for that resolved in the next few days.

 16:18:04 <ScottK> No major issues to report.

 16:18:05 <ScottK> ..

 16:18:19 <skaet> Thanks ScottK!

 16:23:18 * ScottK looks

 16:24:13 <skaet> ScottK,  thanks.   we can follow up after the meeting then.

 16:24:22 <ScottK> skaet: As it says in the bug, I think the question is if Ubiquity can do anything.

 16:24:34 <ScottK> From a KDE perspective it's working as designed.

 16:26:48 <skaet> thanks for flagging micahg,  release note time then it seems.

 16:27:01 <skaet> anyone else?

 16:27:07 <micahg> well, I mean 3.7 is broken, idk about 3.5 in oneiric
