 16:04:52 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Lightning round

 16:05:06 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e cjwatson barry doko stgraber jodh ev bdmurray slangasek)

 16:05:09 <slangasek> cjwatson barry ev slangasek bdmurray doko stgraber jodh

 16:05:24 <slangasek> ev and doko are out, so this should be quick :)

 16:05:25 <slangasek> cjwatson:

 16:05:40 <cjwatson> Some ubiquity fixes: DPKG_UNTRANSLATED_MESSAGES=1 as requested by bdmurray; armhf support; fix for next button to say "Install Now" more reliably when it's supposed to (bug 766265).

 16:05:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 766265 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "Ubiquity proceeds to use free space without warning" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/766265

 16:05:42 <slangasek> (I'll fill in doko's status for him)

 16:05:44 <cjwatson> Added uninstallable output for -updates suites (http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/lucid-updates_probs.html et al).

 16:05:47 <cjwatson> Serious cleanup so I actually have some free space on my SSD ...

 16:05:52 <cjwatson> Submitted several more Launchpad branches for review (bug 551510, bug 118227, bug 240965, bug 383044).  This is mostly because it's clear that there's no Launchpad development resource for a lot of these things and they aren't going to get fixed otherwise; in particular it's been a thorn in my side for some time that installer images aren't signed.

 16:05:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 551510 in Launchpad itself "Port to new python-apt API" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/551510

 16:05:56 <cjwatson> Working on getting germinate output generated directly from the database (for foundations-p-image-build-pipeline).  Partly done but I need to rewrite mvo's Supported extra-overrides handling to work with it.  Some germinate fixes to support this.

 16:05:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 118227 in Launchpad itself "main/debian-installer missing from Release files" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/118227

 16:05:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 240965 in Launchpad itself "publisher doesn't deal with pockets becoming empty" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/240965

 16:05:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 383044 in Launchpad itself "No GPG signatures for nonstandard installers" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/383044

 16:06:01 <cjwatson> Converted libproxy to multiarch.

 16:06:03 <cjwatson> Started on investigating bug 709363.  Hopefully I'll have more luck than previously.

 16:06:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 709363 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "swap partition disappeared during installation" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/709363

 16:06:07 <cjwatson> ..

 16:06:18 <barry> bug 901840 (cython ftbfs); python 3 porting blog post; udd meeting w/poolie; python-dbus porting - submitted upstream, some parts are already being committed to trunk; will be committing more atomic changes to personal git branch and working with upstream on each smaller change.  done.

 16:06:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901840 in cython (Ubuntu) "FTBFS due to test failures" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901840

 16:06:47 * ScottK gives a big +1 on the python3 porting post.

 16:11:25 <jodh> Currently we have a failing test which appears to be caused by the

 16:11:30 <jodh> ❅

 16:13:14 <slangasek> thanks all

 16:13:19 <slangasek> any questions re: statuseses?

 16:13:41 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:13:51 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything new bubbling up this week?

 16:14:20 <bdmurray> slangasek: no not really

 16:14:28 <slangasek> ok

 16:15:27 <bdmurray> actually bug 818177 has seen some recent activity

 16:15:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818177 in udev (Ubuntu Precise) "boot failures because 'udevadm exit' times out while udevd waits for an already-dead thread" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818177

 16:15:53 <besmirgogu> Hi Everybody!!

 16:17:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: I think those comments are misdirected and I'm not sure they're worth following up on individually; we know that we have two other bugs related to udev races still, apw is working on one (bnx2 firmware) and hallyn is working on the other (lvm2) and waiting for me to review/merge

 16:17:54 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay, that makes sense

 16:17:55 <cjwatson> Would anyone like to attack bug 545790?  It's on rls-p-tracking, and it has a relatively clear explanation from mdz; it should be a matter of saving errno until it comes time to display it

 16:17:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 545790 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "package PACKAGE failed to install/upgrade: error writing to '<standard output>': Success" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/545790

 16:19:38 <slangasek> <crickets>

 16:19:52 <slangasek> :)

 16:20:06 <slangasek> well, I'll mark that one 'triaged' at least :)

 16:21:19 * jodh wonders what a "crashed recycle bin" is...?

 16:21:51 <slangasek> heh

 16:21:59 <jodh> don't recycle whilst driving I say!

 16:23:04 <slangasek> ok, well, that one remains on the list of bugs for us to tackle this cycle then

 16:23:15 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:23:17 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:23:18 <cjwatson> or I'll take it, I was just hoping somebody else would :)

 16:23:32 <slangasek> I think everyone else's queue is also full at the moment :)

 16:24:29 <slangasek> btw, if anyone has outstanding expenses for the year, remember that it's a good idea to do those before you go on end-of-year holidays :)

 16:26:06 <slangasek> and next week will be the last meeting of the year... for whoever's still around by that point

 16:26:09 <slangasek> :)

 16:26:45 <barry> :)
