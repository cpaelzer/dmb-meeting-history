 00:03:25 <nhandler> #topic Thomas Martin (tenach)

 00:03:42 <nhandler> tenach: Care to tell us a bit about yourself?

 00:04:25 <tenach> Sure thing! I'm Thomas Martin, known mostly online as tenach. I'm a 23 year old college student and F/OSS & Ubuntu advocate.

 00:04:25 <zkriesse> if i may, just wanted to say im here to endorse Tenach (Thomas Martin)

 00:05:22 <Unit193> I've worked a little with him in UBT and hope to do so more

 00:05:46 <tenach> I've been mostly active through IRC in projects as well as mentoring a team of students in Ohio, in how to use Ubuntu and EyeOS as a Software as a Service cloud for their school. Jordohio is their team lead.

 00:06:03 <tenach> My wiki page is located at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Tenach

 00:06:16 <paultag> WOOO!!!!!!!!

 00:06:22 <paultag> I'm here to cheer for tenach!

 00:06:27 <Jordohio> That's me. :P

 00:07:07 <pleia2> tenach: are you part of a loco team?

 00:07:14 <paultag> I've known tenach for years, and I'm shocked he's not gone for membership before this. He has my total support. </plug> :)

 00:07:23 <tenach> pleia2: I've been in and out of the ubuntu-us-wa chat, but other than that, have never attended any LoCo event

 00:07:44 <tenach> Something I want to remedy really soon, though.

 00:08:06 <beuno> tenach, you've been like the duke nukem forever of applicants!

 00:08:26 <tenach> beuno: +1 on that

 00:08:59 <nhandler> tenach: You've had a goal of becoming MOTU for a while. Have you done any work towards that?

 00:09:08 <zkriesse> Ive known Tenach for some time now and havw always enjoyed his friendly attitude, the way he contributes, and the way he treats new folks to linux etc... im delighted to call him friend and fully support his application...

 00:09:32 <tenach> nhandler: Not actively, no. I have worked some with paultag on learning how to build packages and the like, but nothing too intensive.

 00:11:01 <tenach> I have spent more of my time spreading Ubuntu (the OS and the philosophy) throughout the teams and communities I am part of.

 00:14:05 <nhandler> #topic James Gifford (jrgifford)

 00:14:14 <nhandler> jrgifford: Can you say a few words about yourself?

 00:15:19 <jrgifford> I am a Ubuntu user and advocate. I've been using Ubuntu for about a year, and I've done a fair amount of Q&A on Ask Ubuntu.

 00:15:24 <jrgifford> My wikipage is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/jamesgifford

 00:15:50 <pleia2> great testimonials :)

 00:15:53 <paultag> ( Just took a look from my work in the other window - y'all are making this easy for me -- I'm here to +1 jrgifford too. He took over for me in Cleveland and has been helping with Ubuntu Ohio in a bunch of really awesome ways. I endore his application, too.)

 00:15:57 <beuno> was about to say that

 00:16:01 <nhandler> Your wiki says you plan to work on some Ubuntu Hours for Cleveland. How are those coming along?

 00:16:10 <ajmitch> by a "fair amount" he means in the top most active users on askubuntu

 00:16:40 <jrgifford> nhandler: Currently, it's slow going. Making connections with ubuntu people in the area isn't easy.

 00:16:50 <Unit193> I'm here to say he does work in our LoCo as well

 00:16:52 <paultag> I totally agree with that

 00:16:53 <oli> Yeah James is extremely useful at helping people (and us mods) on Ask Ubuntu. A real asset to our community.

 00:17:10 <greg-g> awesome, thanks for the testimonials, everyone

 00:17:15 <jrgifford> nhandler: However, we're about to get a date for a release party. (late, but still worth it)

 00:17:43 <cyphermox> jrgifford: it´ s never too late :)

 00:17:55 <nhandler> I completely agree with that ;)

 01:00:10 <nathwill> whoooo!!!!

 01:00:16 <MarkDude> +1

 01:00:34 * bkerensa waves

 01:00:37 <c_smith> Good Luck, bkerensa!

 01:00:38 <nathwill> i'm here for bkerensa. my 2 cents: bkerensa is the number one reason we have a loco in OR. i've been on the or-loco mailing list since forever, and since ben's gotten involved, i get mail, we've been having regular meetings and promotional/awareness events, and we're having a big release party tomorrow :) he's got my endorsement all the way.

 01:00:51 <paultag> I'm here to +1 bkerensa - his work has been visible to the loco-council and I think it's of the quality we expect to see from a team contact. He's friendly and outgoing, and would be a good addition to the community

 01:01:01 <paultag> that's all for endorsements for the day. Thanks, RMB!

 01:01:05 * MarkDude is here to support bkerensa

 01:01:11 <c_smith> Same as Paultag and Markdude.

 01:01:13 <MarkDude> Great team lead

 01:01:24 <MarkDude> Very friendly and welcoming

 01:01:47 <Darkwing> I'm here to +1 bkerensa, Not only is he involved in the OR Loco he also sits and helps with the California team as much as possible. He is a GREAT help when ever he can!

 01:02:05 <bkerensa> Thanks guys

 01:02:09 <c_smith> Bkerensa puts a lot of effort and time into Ubuntu Oregon Team.

 01:02:20 <juancarlospaco> I have to go, congrants all new members!

 01:02:22 <juancarlospaco> bye

 01:02:48 <MarkDude> He was able to get momentum going in Oregon - where others had not been able to ( like myself)

 01:05:11 <bkerensa> oh yeah

 01:05:22 <nhandler> #topic Marco Ceppi (marcoceppi)

 01:05:27 <ajmitch> just +1 him

 01:05:37 <marcoceppi> I've gone ahead and prepared a quick intro

 01:05:40 <marcoceppi> Hello, my name is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/marco-ceppi I have been using Ubuntu for the past 6 years. Prior to this I used Debian and CentOS. Professionally I work as both a Linux System Administrator and a Web Developer. Recently I've been working closely with the Stack Exchange team as a Moderator of Ask Ubuntu – there I've spent my time helping new and current users of Ubuntu get help with the

 01:05:40 <marcoceppi> ir questions while helping to shape what I hope becomes an important cornerstone to the Community Support for Ubuntu. I look forward to continuing my support for the Ubuntu community and platform wherever I can, whenever I can. Above all I view myself as in debt to the Ubuntu community for helping to provide me and many people I work, know, and associate with, for providing me with an exceptional

 01:05:40 <marcoceppi> operating system. I hope to become a member to continue my support of Ubuntu and it's community.

 01:05:46 * george_e is here to support MarcoCeppi!

 01:06:14 <george_e> Marco has been an _amazing_ moderator on Ask Ubuntu.

 01:06:15 * marcoceppi swears it's under the 5 sentence limit :)

 01:07:39 <jrgifford> marcoceppi: You think too hard about things like that.

 01:07:42 <nhandler> I've seen the quality (and quantity) of your answers on ask ubuntu. I'm quite impressed

 01:08:00 <marcoceppi> nhandler: thank you!

 01:08:10 <nhandler> marcoceppi: Are you involved with a LoCo?

 01:08:30 <oli> Ask Ubuntu wouldn't run without Marco. He is an essential member of the team there.

 01:08:33 <marcoceppi> Not as actively as I should be, but I do follow discussions of the DC-Loco

 01:08:40 <marcoceppi> via their mailing list

 01:09:21 <marcoceppi> and have been accepted into their community

 01:09:46 <jrgifford> if it wasn't for Marco, Ask Ubuntu would exist, but it wouldn't be what it is now.

 01:10:31 <oli> Indeed. Somebody has to moderate jrgifford :)
