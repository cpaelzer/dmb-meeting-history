 17:09:56 <Ursinha> nothing really from me :)

 17:10:11 <nuclearbob> all right

 17:10:18 <jibel> Not much from me now that Oneiric is out and Precise is on a very early stage

 17:10:27 <nuclearbob> we've got a birds of a feather session scheduled for UDS

 17:10:41 <nuclearbob> if anybody has the link, please throw that out, otherwise I can find it

 17:11:13 <patrickmw> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-P/TestingInUbuntu

 17:11:25 <nuclearbob> thanks patrickmw

 17:11:43 <nuclearbob> we have a good list of talks lined up for that

 17:12:04 <nuclearbob> so we look forward to seeing people there

 17:12:19 <nuclearbob> anything else on this topic?

 17:13:09 <nuclearbob> all right, moving on

 17:13:24 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Automated/Systems Testing

 17:13:33 <patrickmw> o/

 17:13:43 <nuclearbob> go ahead, patrickmw

 17:13:59 <patrickmw> new projects in progres:

 17:14:01 <patrickmw> bootchart testing revised - boot speed testing will be testing daily for Precise. The testing that was done for Oneiric needs some improvements. Planning set for the automation sprint.

 17:14:03 <patrickmw> fwts - Firmware Test Suite will be run daily for Precise.  A wrapper utility needs to be developed so it can be run in the lab. Planning set for the automation sprint.

 17:14:05 <patrickmw> project updates:

 17:14:07 <patrickmw> dx projects - DX team has started adding their projects to the QA daily builds. yay!

 17:14:35 <patrickmw> that's all

 17:14:53 <nuclearbob> thanks for the update, that all sounds great

 17:15:27 <nuclearbob> I'm working on a proof of concept for a remotely accessible test running interface for the qa-regression-testing scripts

 17:15:48 <nuclearbob> just a quick cgi that can be installed as a package on a newly created vm and return test results

 17:16:11 <nuclearbob> I hope to have a basic implementation of that ready before UDS so we can determine if it's something we want to devote further resources to

 17:16:21 <nuclearbob> and that's all I've got

 17:17:36 <nuclearbob> anybody else?

 17:18:14 <nuclearbob> all right, moving on
