 00:00:36 <pleia2> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for Thursday, November 17th. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:00:46 <pleia2> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:00:52 <pleia2> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:01:00 <pleia2> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:01:21 <pleia2> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:01:26 <pleia2> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:01:33 <pleia2> looks like kdub isn't here

 00:01:37 <pleia2> Resistance: are you here?

 00:01:45 <Resistance> affirmitive, standby 2 mins

 00:01:56 <pleia2> Resistance: please go ahead and introduce yourself when you're ready :)

 00:02:36 <marcoceppi> Hello!

 00:02:43 <jrgifford> Hallo!

 00:02:50 * jrgifford is here in support of Resistance

 00:03:02 <Oli> Wooooooo! (also here for Resistance!)

 00:03:18 <pleia2> great :)

 00:03:19 <Resistance> Firstly, i apologizing for holding everything up for two minutes, i happened to be in the midst of a phone call at the time.

 00:03:28 <marcoceppi> I am also!

 00:03:38 <mainerror> Same here!

 00:03:44 <jrgifford> Resistance: you gambled you had a guy in front of you, didn't you? :P

 00:04:01 <marcoceppi> In support of resistance sending support via mobile phone

 00:04:39 * greg-g waves

 00:05:31 <Resistance> Secondly, allow me to introduce myself.  My name, as my wiki page states (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Thomas%20Ward), is Thomas Ward.  I have been working with Ubuntu since the release of Jaunty (9.04), both receiving and providing support.  Initially starting out from the Ubuntu Forums, and providing support to users of Dell systems with Ubuntu, as I use Dell systems, I eventually began assisting with more complex

 00:05:31 <Resistance> issues. ...

 00:06:14 <cyphermox> yeah! /me loves Dell hardware for Ubuntu, generally

 00:07:08 <pleia2> Resistance: oh! I didn't realize who you were, bah nick changes :)

 00:07:23 <pleia2> (I recognised your real name, was trying to remember why)

 00:07:28 <Resistance> pleia2:  aye, I'm a member of the PA Loco Team :P

 00:08:21 <Resistance> I have been, as of late, working on increasing my technical knowledge of Packaging for Ubuntu, and recently gave a session to people on the AskUbuntu site regarding the basics of packaging and what is necessary to get started.

 00:08:50 <greg-g> Resistance: could you link to that session, I'm curious!

 00:08:56 <pleia2> wow, nice work on askubuntu

 00:09:02 <Resistance> greg-g:  if you can give me two minutes to dig up the links, sure.

 00:09:25 <Oli> It's in the testimonials

 00:09:27 <pleia2> Resistance: any plans to get Pittsburgh area going with some release parties? :)

 00:09:48 <Oli> http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/663

 00:09:56 <greg-g> Oli: oh, thanks :)

 00:09:56 <Resistance> oh, Oli beat me to it :P

 00:10:32 <Resistance> pleia2:  i've actually been more active in the Harrisburg area as my studies have taken me to Penn State, Harrisburg Campus, for the Security and Risk Analysis, Cyber Security Focus, degree.

 00:10:40 <pleia2> ah, cool

 00:10:51 <pleia2> shame the harrisburg open source conference was canceled this year :(

 00:11:06 <Resistance> Indeed.  If it had not been canceled, I would likely have attended.

 00:11:08 <n0rman> great work Resistance

 00:11:12 <Resistance> thank you, n0rman.

 00:12:04 <n0rman> Resistance: so you are not collaborating with any LoCo Team ?

 00:12:42 <Resistance> n0rman:  I am still listed as a member on the Pennsylvania LoCo team, but my time schedule has not permitted me to attend any actual events.

 00:13:01 <Resistance> I also have not actively collaborated with the Pennsylvania LoCo team due to that time schedule.

 00:13:13 <Resistance> However, I do plan in future to participate more actively.
