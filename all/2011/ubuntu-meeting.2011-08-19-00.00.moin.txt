 00:00:47 <pleia2> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for August 18th 2011.  The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:01:01 <pleia2> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:01:09 <pleia2> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:01:21 <pleia2> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:01:28 <pleia2> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:01:34 <pleia2> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:01:55 <pleia2> looks like tenach isn't here

 00:02:03 <pleia2> [TOPIC] dscassel membership

 00:02:03 <meetingology> TOPIC: dscassel membership

 00:02:16 <dscassel> Hi. :)

 00:03:28 <dscassel> So I'm Darcy.  I'm the LoCo contact for Ubuntu Canada.

 00:03:28 <pleia2> dscassel: please introduce yourself and provide a link to your wiki :)

 00:03:41 <dscassel> Wiki page here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dscassel

 00:03:53 <beuno> LoCo contact, fancy!

 00:04:14 <cyphermox> doing a great job at it too.

 00:04:16 <dscassel> I started out running release parties in my town, then formed a group locally.

 00:04:20 <dscassel> Thanks. :)

 00:04:35 <dscassel> Then I decided to revive the Ubuntu Canada LoCo which had been dormant a couple years.

 00:05:01 <beuno> CUSTOM CAKES!

 00:05:07 <dscassel> Since then I've been continuing to do local stuff and trying to encourage other Canadian cities to join the fun.

 00:05:11 <dscassel> Yes! :D

 00:05:27 <dscassel> My friend Holly does the decarating.  She's a pretty fantastic artist. :)

 00:06:18 <beuno> and an endorsment from Corey, hard to beat that

 00:06:21 <dscassel> Anyway, I've taken up chairing the ubuntu-ca IRC meetings, and I'm slowly getting out and meeting Ubuntu people in Ontario.

 00:06:45 <dscassel> beuno: I think he was happy someone finally took the LoCo off his hands. :)

 00:07:26 <dscassel> He hadn't had time to do anything for a while, so I approached him about taking over.

 00:08:44 <pleia2> such a complete wiki! and love to see such great testimonials :)

 00:08:54 <dscassel> Thanks, pleia2 :)

 00:09:17 <dscassel> I've been through LoCo reapprovals, so I have a pretty good idea what goes over well. :)

 00:10:19 <beuno> dscassel, what's it like being the LoCo contact?

 00:10:41 <dscassel> beuno: It's certainly interesting.

 00:11:21 <dscassel> Most of the job involves motivating (or trying to motivate) other people remotely.

 00:11:23 <beuno> "the airpplane just lost an engine" interesting?  :)

 00:11:24 <dscassel> And that's hard.

 00:11:43 <dscassel> I can keep running cool events and stuff in town fine, and that's great.

 00:11:49 <dscassel> I think most LoCos run like that anyway.

 00:12:02 <dscassel> But to be Ubuntu Canada, it really ought to be more than just me here in Waterloo.

 00:12:31 <dscassel> I've had some success encouraging things in Toronto.  But a big part of that is Toronto is an hour down the road.

 00:13:14 * beuno nods

 00:15:21 <holstein> hello all... this is my page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/holstein#About_Me

 00:15:48 <holstein> im a musician in asheville north carolina, in akgraner 's neck of the woods

 00:16:16 <holstein> i organize the local LUG meetings http://www.wnclug.info/

 00:16:45 <holstein> we try and *not* have an ubuntu users group, since it was alreay in place before i got there, but we do lots of ubuntu showcases

 00:17:47 <pleia2> yeah, I ran the LUG in Philly for a while, the Ubuntu volunteers were great for doing presentations and events at and with the LUG :) great way to work together

 00:17:49 <holstein> our NC loco is a bit down at the moment, and in transition, but there are 4 or 5 or us that our going to bring it back hopefully this fall

 00:18:13 <holstein> pleia2: akgraner has presented a few times :)

 00:18:43 <pleia2> what kind of work do you do for ubuntu studio? (I'm familiar with your UWN and tireless #ubuntu-beginners support work :))

 00:18:43 <holstein> i am active, and probably mostly focuses on ubuntustudio right now

 00:18:56 <holstein> its mostly trying to drum up help

 00:19:18 <holstein> im probably never going to be a coding contributor, which is unfortunate, since thats what we really need

 00:19:44 <holstein> but, i am helping with documenation, running meetings.. whatever scott lavendar needs help with

 00:19:51 <pleia2> great

 00:20:04 <holstein> these are exciting times (potentially) for that team

 00:20:20 <holstein> lots of new software coming in... ardour3, switching to XFCE

 00:20:28 <holstein> we'll see...

 00:20:33 <pleia2> I have to admit that I'm pleased about the switch to XFCE (my love!) :)

 00:20:43 <holstein> yeah, the xubuntu team is just awesome
