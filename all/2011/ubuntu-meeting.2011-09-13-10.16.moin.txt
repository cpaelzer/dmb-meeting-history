 10:29:38 <head_victim_defy> Are there any other applicants here?

 10:30:41 <head_victim_defy> Or does anyone else have anything to bring up tonight?

 10:31:24 <ejat> i think only the one that u suggest just now

 10:31:47 <Destine> ejat, agree. That page is really out of date.

 10:31:51 <ejat> we need to notice or acknowledge the candidates for our next meeting

 10:32:10 <czajkowski> or else spring clean the wiki page fro start and if people are still interested they will re add themselves

 10:32:30 <ejat> czajkowski: agreed ..

 10:32:34 <Destine> czajkowski, agree.

 10:33:19 <czajkowski> it's not fair on the candidates and also havng a full set of members here as well so meetings start on time is more encouraging for members

 10:33:21 <head_victim_defy> Okay if you are all happy me to do I'll email them all this week telling them to reapply when ready

 10:34:29 <Destine> head_victim_defy, could you please tell me when is the next meeting?
