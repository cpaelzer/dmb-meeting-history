 18:07:32 <gema> [TOPIC] Automated/Systems Testing

 18:07:49 <gema> so, I have feedback from jibel here too:

 18:08:01 <gema> * we are now keeping 15 days on ISO in the Lab https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-builds-smoke-testing

 18:08:18 <gema> we are starting a historic of builds so that when a build is broken, we can go back and test on yesterdays

 18:08:27 <gema> we'll keep 2 weeks worth of builds for now

 18:08:41 <gema> we'll let you know as soon as they are externally accessible

 18:08:56 <gema> * Unity Testing: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-unity-quality + https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/AutomatedTesting/UnityAutolandingSetup

 18:09:15 <gema> details regarding the unity testing we are trying to run on Jenkins

 18:09:31 <gema> or rather, we are running

 18:10:04 <gema> * desktop images are broken but we are working on it

 18:10:17 <gema> anything else to report, anyone?

 18:10:48 <gema> nuclearbob?

 18:11:10 <nuclearbob> we've got a wrapper to run the qa-regression-testing scripts in autotest now

 18:11:12 <nuclearbob> I'

 18:11:31 <nuclearbob> m getting autotest packaged so we can get it installed in the new lab and start using it to run qrt tests from jenkins

 18:12:15 <gema> sounds good, thanks, anyone else?

 18:12:21 <nuclearbob> I'll also be working on collecting manual testing results from checkbox to get them into the same data source as our automated testing, but that project is still commencing

 18:12:24 <nuclearbob> ..

 18:12:27 <gema> sorry, :D

 18:12:59 <gema> oh, yep, integrating checkbox with litmus

 18:13:18 <gema> I forgot to mention, we are in the process of getting a litmus instance installed for everyone to use and contribute test cases to

 18:13:35 <gema> this is a pilot, we'll let you know whenever it is ready to use

 18:13:50 <gema> (i.e. when it is fully functional)

 18:14:06 <gema> that's all from us, I think
