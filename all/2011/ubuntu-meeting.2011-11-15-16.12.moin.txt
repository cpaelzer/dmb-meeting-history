 16:12:17 <jamespage> o/

 16:12:26 <smoser> ok

 16:12:27 <jamespage> around but am at a sprint :-)

 16:13:13 <hggdh> ~Ã´~

 16:13:16 <smoser> #TOPIC Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:13:24 * smoser smb, jamespage, hggdh to work on triaging bug #790712 (carry over)

 16:13:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Precise) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:13:49 <smoser> smoser, jamespage hggdh ? anything there?

 16:14:01 <smb> hggdh has closed it after verifying it did not occur on precise

 16:14:02 <hggdh> smoser: done, I closed the bug fixreleased on Precise, wontfix on oneiric and natty (after talking with smb)

 16:14:14 <smoser> thank you sir.

 16:14:20 <Daviey> smb: accidental fix, or something resolved it?

 16:14:27 <hggdh> unknown fix

 16:14:29 <smb> smb, magic

 16:14:33 <hggdh> act of god?

 16:14:38 <smb> Daviey, ^

 16:14:41 <Daviey> \o/

 16:14:52 <Daviey> It's fixed, that is the main thing. :)

 16:14:52 <smoser> #TOPIC Precise Development

 16:15:03 <Daviey> Blueprints, Blueprints, Blueprints.

 16:15:09 <smoser> The thing to be aware of is that feature definition freeze is coming up

 16:15:20 <smoser> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseSchedule?action=show&redirect=PreciseReleaseSchedule

 16:15:32 <smoser> bad url.

 16:15:32 <Daviey> Many of the blueprints are not fully spec'd out.  They need to be final by EoW..  Please keep in mind that robbiew and myself need time to review before this.

 16:15:32 <smoser> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseSchedule

 16:15:45 <hallyn> smoser, and what exactly does that mean?  all 'actions' must be in the blueprints?

 16:16:06 <robbiew> All workitems need to be in the blueprints

 16:16:09 <hallyn> k

 16:16:12 <smoser> well, realistically it means someone (robbiew) has to end up saying "yes we're going to work on this" for this cycle

 16:16:13 <roaksoax> o/

 16:16:15 <robbiew> so we can effectively track our progress and workload

 16:16:23 <smoser> and you have to provide him with enough info to actually make that decision

 16:16:23 <Daviey> Are there any questions regarding blueprint process?

 16:16:37 <robbiew> smoser: exactly...thx

 16:17:04 <utlemming> as a point of clarification, are work items just little "TODO" labels in the blueprint?

 16:17:16 <Daviey> If anyone does have any questions, please raise them in #ubuntu-server after the meeting.

 16:17:36 <Daviey> utlemming: err, TODO is appended to the end

 16:17:43 <smoser> utlemming, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WorkItemsHowto

 16:18:07 <smoser> moving on

 16:18:10 <Daviey> Next on development... zul, cobbler merge.. any progress?

 16:18:22 <smoser> moving back

 16:18:30 <zul> still waiting for 2.2.2 but we are closer

 16:18:44 <Daviey> zul: can we not get a snapshot in this week?

 16:18:54 <roaksoax> zul: did they merge your patches yet?

 16:19:02 <zul> Daviey: yeah we can..

 16:19:06 <zul> roaksoax: not yet

 16:19:09 <Daviey> Really want to land Clint and rbasak's security fixes asap.

 16:19:32 <Daviey> hallyn: libvirt merge from sid?

 16:19:34 <zul> Daviey: will do it this afternoon

 16:19:39 <hallyn> Daviey, haven't started it

 16:19:41 <hallyn> should be trivial

 16:20:54 <hallyn> hm, well the automount part, i am going to have to look at autofs wrt namespaces real soon now

 16:21:42 <Daviey> i think bug 888671, just needs a final review and sponsor.. smoser, i'd quite like your thoughts on that

 16:21:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 888671 in facter (Ubuntu) "Please merge facter 1.6.2 (main) from Debian testing (main)" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/888671

 16:22:03 <smoser> i have no expertise there, but i'll take a look after meeting

 16:22:08 <Daviey> adam_g: cobbler-enlist.. have you been able to touch it?

 16:22:24 <Daviey> smoser: it's more that i'd like a second opinion.

 16:23:27 <smoser> k.

 16:23:30 <Daviey> zul: bug 871278, will land this Friday in Precise right?

 16:26:44 <jdstrand> Daviey: I wasn't sure how appropriate it would be for me to do that. if you guys have dotted all the Is and crossed the Ts already, then I can talk a look

 16:26:53 <Daviey> roaksoax: bug 880339? :)

 16:26:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 880339 in mysql-5.1 (Ubuntu Precise) "AppArmor profile needs update" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/880339

 16:27:12 <Daviey> zul: Do you consider the I's and T's dotted?

 16:27:49 <zul> Daviey: i think so

 16:27:51 <roaksoax> Daviey: again, I tested this in two oneiric machines and didn't see any issues

 16:27:53 <Daviey> bug 887410, needs an assignee... seemingly biteish-size if someone wants to grab it.. anyone?

 16:27:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 887410 in apache2 (Ubuntu Precise) "plymouth ask-for-passphrase" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/887410

 16:28:15 <Daviey> roaksoax: can you mark it invalid if you believe so, and state what you did to test?

 16:28:44 <zul> Daviey:  clint should probably look at the plymouth one

 16:28:48 <Daviey> hallyn: Progress to get bug 876768 fixed in Debian?

 16:28:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 876768 in Ubuntu "[needs-packaging] netcf" [Wishlist,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/876768

 16:28:54 <Daviey> zul: good idea.

 16:29:00 <hallyn> Daviey, none.

 16:29:04 <Daviey> ok

 16:29:17 <hallyn> Need to find a sponsor.

 16:29:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 881464 in keystone (Ubuntu) "[MIR] keystone" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/881464

 16:29:23 <hallyn> (the one i asked is too busy)

 16:29:36 <Daviey> hallyn: Ah, if that is all you are blocked on.. we can get that fix0rd!

 16:29:45 <hallyn> yes, that's all.

 16:29:51 <hallyn> packaging is done from my pov

 16:32:17 <smoser> Daviey, anything else ?

 16:33:00 <Daviey> I don't think so

 16:33:03 <Daviey> Anything from anyone else?

 16:33:12 <Daviey> Any other bugs that should be tracked?

 16:33:14 <Ursinha> (sorry guys, I forgot today would be a national holiday)

 16:33:19 <Daviey> (please do raise them)

 16:33:30 <Daviey> Ursinha: No problem, we'll catch up tomorrow.

 16:33:46 <smoser> #TOPIC Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:34:23 <smoser> anyone ?

 16:35:04 <smoser> #TOPIC Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:35:09 <Daviey> hey hallyn !

 16:35:13 <Daviey> err, hggdh

 16:35:16 <smoser> hggdh, you have anything ? anyone have anything for hggdh ?

 16:35:16 <hggdh> heh

 16:35:19 <hggdh> OK

 16:35:23 <Daviey> hggdh / jamespage: how is the sprint going?

 16:35:28 <Daviey> Any outcomes so far?

 16:35:54 <hggdh> still on its infacy, I think (I am remote, due to family illness)

 16:36:11 <hggdh> please do not forget the tests...

 16:36:23 <jamespage> TBH first half of week is tear down and rebuild the Ubuntu QA test lab :-)

 16:36:40 <Daviey> hggdh: The human based testing needs a serious refresh, right?

 16:36:47 <jamespage> OpenStack testing servers are now racked - power and network in progress

 16:36:49 <Daviey> (methodology.)

 16:36:54 <hggdh> yes, it does, and we are looking at them

 16:36:57 <Daviey> jamespage: That is great to hear!

 16:37:20 <Daviey> hggdh: Okay.. are you drafting a list of areas that need fixing?

 16:37:29 <hggdh> Daviey: and the unittests we currently have need beefing up

 16:38:01 <hggdh> Daviey: yes, we will be doing it. Meanwhile, please remember to start adding tests to the patches

 16:38:04 <robbiew> jamespage: \0/

 16:38:07 <Daviey> hggdh: Okay, will you be able to report next week where we need improvement?

 16:38:17 <hggdh> Daviey: most certainly

 16:38:23 <Daviey> hggdh: 'tests to the patches'?

 16:38:57 <hggdh> Daviey: well, if a patch changes something (which usually happens), then it would be nice to have an unit test for it

 16:39:49 <Daviey> hggdh: a package derived unit test, if the package supports it's own unit testing?

 16:40:02 <hggdh> Daviey: EVEN better!

 16:40:14 <hggdh> then we can run it anytime

 16:40:24 <Daviey> Hmm.. We don't yet have a framework for external unit tests, do we?

 16:40:39 <Daviey> other than the lp:qa-regression-suite , right?

 16:40:52 <hggdh> no, not yet. By end-of-week we should have directions

 16:41:06 <Daviey> hggdh: great

 16:41:15 <hggdh> and this is it from me

 16:41:18 <hggdh> ..

 16:41:43 <Daviey> thanks hggdh !

 16:41:43 <smoser> #TOPIC Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:41:46 * smb has two things...

 16:41:53 <smb> First bug 881076: Workaround (idle=halt) proposed and smoser has build images. Upstream still discussing how to really fix this.

 16:41:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 881076 in linux (Ubuntu) "precise kernels do not boot on ec2" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/881076

 16:42:13 <smoser> smb, well, imags have not successfully been built as a result of a perl issue at the moment.

 16:42:33 <smb> So s/has/will/ :)

 16:43:01 <Daviey> smoser: since when?

 16:43:05 <smb> Anyway, the "right" fix seems to be highly debatable. I follow it upstream

 16:43:22 <smoser> perl transition.

 16:44:08 <smoser> so once that gets sorted out, we'll get images iwith that ahck around.

 16:44:17 <Daviey> great

 16:44:41 <smb> The second thing is that I have been reading my work item about openvswitch today (this time with my brains actually turned on). And somehow I remember the request a bit differently. IMO it was to bring the package into main, not the module into the kernel...

 16:44:50 <Daviey> smb: is bug 854050 fixed in Precise?

 16:44:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854050 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG at /build/buildd/linux-2.6.38/mm/swapfile.c:255" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854050

 16:45:04 <smoser> smb, i would think we'd need both.

 16:45:24 <Daviey> smb: I don't see why it should be in the kernel, dkms makes more sense until it's mainline upstream, right?

 16:45:26 <smb> Daviey, I need to check, this has been a bit of a fail on the maintainer submission

 16:45:40 <smb> smoser, I'd be with Daviey there

 16:45:41 <smoser> ah. yeah, dkms is fine.

 16:45:54 <smoser> i thought you were implying it was in kernel just not enabled.

 16:45:55 <smb> It just makes things prone to bit rot in any part

 16:46:10 <smb> Ah k. No the package provides a dkms binary

 16:46:39 <smb> But the package is in universe right now, so I think that need an mir

 16:46:50 <smoser> right.

 16:47:23 <smoser> Daviey, we want an action for mir of openvswitch?

 16:47:37 <smoser> at least to open bug. if its agreed, then i'll take action

 16:48:06 <smoser> smoser, just fyi, i'd like bug 890447 addressed.

 16:48:07 <smb> Daviey, After looking quickly the patch for 854050 is not upstream yet

 16:48:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 890447 in linux (Ubuntu) "need to manually run depmod after installation of linux-image-extra-VERSION-virtual package" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/890447

 16:48:10 <Daviey> smoser: Hmm, are we MIR'ing NaaS componet?

 16:48:30 <Daviey> Quantum

 16:48:34 <smoser> i think no

 16:48:35 <zul> no

 16:48:49 <smb> smoser, Noted as I think you meant me :)

 16:48:51 <zul> its not part of core project so it stays in universe

 16:48:53 <Daviey> So what part needs openvswitch?

 16:49:01 <smoser> smb i did indeed.

 16:49:02 <Daviey> Don't you need Quantum for openvswitch?

 16:49:25 <smoser> you need neither for neither explicitly

 16:49:40 <smoser> but likely quantum would use openvswitch, at least in the open source paths.

 16:49:43 <zul> why is openvswitch getting MIRed again?

 16:49:57 <smoser> but anyway, it i think it is not. i'm not sure why this came up, and i responded poorly.

 16:50:07 <smoser> anyone have a reason as to why openvswitch should be MIRd?

 16:50:07 <Daviey> zul: that is what i am trying to find out

 16:50:23 <Daviey> Are we MIR'ing a a non openstack option, or something to use as openstack?

 16:50:24 <zul> i dont

 16:50:27 <smoser> ok. unless someone provides one, we are not.

 16:50:37 <medberry> will Quantum have any usefulness without it?

 16:50:37 <hallyn> i thought we wanted it for openstack i think

 16:50:41 <hallyn> lemme look over the mtg notes

 16:50:52 <smoser> ugh.

 16:51:02 <smoser> ok. i think this is all true:

 16:51:08 <Daviey> medberry: Yes, but if Quantum is in universe, there is no archive requirement for openvswitch to be in main

 16:51:12 <smoser> * quantum can use openvswitch.

 16:51:17 <zul> quantum is *not* going into main

 16:51:20 <medberry> Daviey, nod.

 16:51:21 <Daviey> Unless there is another use-case we care about?

 16:51:22 <smoser> * quantum can use other networking back ends

 16:51:27 <medberry> gotcha.

 16:51:41 <smoser> * quantum will is not a part of openstack core (or whatever thats called) for essex

 16:51:42 <Daviey> smoser: table this, unti we get more info.

 16:51:43 <medberry> yep, quantum can use real hardware

 16:51:52 <smoser> * some parties have requested we support quantum

 16:51:58 <smoser> moving on.

 16:52:11 <smoser> smb, you have ability to at least assign that depmod bug to the rigth person?

 16:52:23 <smb> smoser, Yes, or take it myself

 16:52:28 <smoser> please do.

 16:52:46 <Daviey> any other kernel bugs?

 16:52:56 <smoser> other than bugs listed, the kernel has no bugs

 16:53:10 <smoser> #TOPIC Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

 16:53:13 <smoser> NCommander, ?

 16:53:16 <Daviey> (thanks smb)

 16:53:17 <smoser> i'm thinking this is a no-op?

 16:53:47 <Daviey> NCommander: your call starts in 7 mins.

 16:54:12 <smoser> Daviey, and this meeting is supposed to end in 7mins. so i say we move on.

 16:54:49 <Daviey> Any new Ubuntu Server people here want to say hello?

 16:55:13 <zul> any shoutouts?

 16:55:27 <Daviey> no homie.

 16:55:39 <Daviey> smoser: next?
