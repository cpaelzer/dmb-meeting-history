 22:02:42 <dholbach> â†’ antigua 2

 22:02:49 <dholbach> (if you want to listen in)

 22:03:04 <pleia2> #topic Community Council meeting in #ubuntu-uds-Antigua2 shoutcast: http://icecast.ubuntu.com:8000/status.xsl (antigua2)

 22:03:08 <pleia2> there we go :)

 22:03:09 <AlanBell> vlc http://icecast.ubuntu.com:8000/antigua2.ogg.m3u

 22:03:12 <dholbach> excellent

 22:03:16 <pleia2> we're over in #ubuntu-uds-Antigua2

 22:03:42 <AlanBell> want the meeting bot in there?

 22:03:47 <pleia2> nah

 22:03:51 <beuno> I think this is good

 22:04:23 <alourie> it's streaming allright

 22:05:02 <beuno> yes

 22:05:07 <beuno> nobody talk to each other

 22:05:45 <beuno> I think people can listen in

 22:05:48 <beuno> and type here

 22:05:51 <pleia2> #topic Community Council Meeting

 22:05:56 <pleia2> ok, we just do it here :)

 22:06:03 <alourie> we hear you

 22:06:09 <alourie> :-)

 22:06:28 <czajkowski> Aloha

 22:06:33 <AlanBell> I can ask the bot to join the other channel if you want to use the big screen

 22:06:35 <pleia2> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda

 22:07:03 <dholbach> AlanBell, when you reviewed the list of blogs what did you find?

 22:07:04 <AlanBell> not completed the exercise yet, about 400 names compared so far

 22:07:29 <beuno> so who's there?

 22:07:33 <AlanBell> there do appear to be quite a few that need further review, I can't match easily

 22:07:35 <pleia2> last time nigelb handled this, and also added contacts for all the teams (yay!)

 22:07:40 <AlanBell> great

 22:07:43 <dholbach> AlanBell, thanks a lot for doing this exercise

 22:07:58 <akgraner> Ditto thanks AlanBell!

 22:08:02 <AlanBell> so I will finish up and share the spreadsheet with the CC for further review

 22:08:11 <AlanBell> there might be more you can match than I can

 22:08:25 <pleia2> my inbox tells me this was done in June of this year

 22:08:30 <beuno> o/  Mark

 22:08:33 <AlanBell> e.g. dave.walker==daviey, jono==jonobacon etc

 22:08:47 <AlanBell> pleia2: ok, great, I shouldn't find too many then

 22:09:43 <pleia2> #topic Add Canonical blog to Ubuntu Planet

 22:10:44 <beuno> I don;t think we can do that

 22:10:53 <beuno> because it's a per-feed setting

 22:11:06 <AlanBell> who is the contact person (who is an Ubuntu Member) for voices?

 22:11:08 <beuno> (for voices)

 22:13:16 <beuno> http://blog.canonical.com/?

 22:13:45 <pleia2> #action dholbach to coordinate getting Canonical Blog w/ Ubuntu Planet tag added to Ubuntu Planet

 22:13:45 * meetingology dholbach to coordinate getting Canonical Blog w/ Ubuntu Planet tag added to Ubuntu Planet

 22:13:48 <pleia2> beuno: yes

 22:13:51 <Gwaihir> beuno, yep

 22:14:21 <beuno> k, I think we just add in the right feed

 22:14:39 <pleia2> https://code.launchpad.net/~nigelbabu/+junk/planet-filter

 22:14:44 <AlanBell> there is an imperfect match between "nick = " lines and launchapd nicks

 22:14:54 <AlanBell> jono and jonobacon for example

 22:15:10 <AlanBell> and nick=daviey is ~dave.walker

 22:15:32 <AlanBell> I might tidy that up to launchpad nicks and try to get an easier process

 22:15:50 <beuno> every year

 22:16:19 <pleia2> #topic General Community Comments?

 22:17:23 <beuno> +1

 22:20:01 * beuno stares at popey

 22:20:14 * popey tickles beuno

 22:20:19 <pleia2> #action CC to develop basic question template for teams who come to CC meetings

 22:20:19 * meetingology CC to develop basic question template for teams who come to CC meetings

 22:20:34 <beuno> terms, multiple boards at the same time?

 22:21:38 <dholbach> page 25 of the survey results

 22:25:47 * AlanBell wonders if sabdfl filled out the survey

 22:27:41 <beuno> a simple(r) survey

 22:28:03 <beuno> "General Quality", "Interface", "Hardware support", etc

 22:29:23 <beuno> from personal experience, I see 1 or 2 emails a week in my LoCo list with people "leaving Ubuntu"

 22:29:35 <beuno> which I haven't seen before the last year or so

 22:31:18 <beuno> no, but why is it happening more frequently?   Existing members start to feel bad about the general direction fo the project

 22:31:29 * AlanBell has finished the first pass of planet feed/member list comparison

 22:31:53 <czajkowski> AlanBell: thank you

 22:31:56 <AlanBell> there are 95 blog feed nicks that I am unable to simply match off against launchpad nicks of members

 22:32:02 * dholbach hugs AlanBell

 22:32:03 <beuno> I don't feel this is the case anymore

 22:32:09 <beuno> it was when we switched to Unity

 22:32:32 <beuno> but I don't feel that's it anymore

 22:32:32 <AlanBell> some of whom I am sure can be matched as I recognise the nicks as active

 22:32:43 <czajkowski> nods

 22:36:07 <AlanBell> oops, make that 134

 22:36:33 <czajkowski> 134 is a lot

 22:36:36 <beuno> yes, we get those several times a week

 22:37:00 <beuno> I think there's no good way to communicate with all _users_

 22:37:11 <beuno> we could of had an intro on the actual install

 22:37:28 <beuno> "Hi!  We changes the world. Here is how things are better."

 22:37:38 <beuno> s/installer/first boot

 22:38:15 * beuno suspects the irc channel is not on the projector

 22:38:25 <Gwaihir> beuno, no, it is

 22:38:25 <dholbach> beuno, it is

 22:38:35 <Gwaihir> we are reading

 22:39:27 <beuno> I think the gnome shell thing is in the past now

 22:39:52 <beuno> the problem will be on end users who don't know about these things

 22:39:57 <beuno> for this LTS

 22:40:15 <beuno> we should tell people, when they boot up, why we changed the world, and why it's better

 22:40:55 <Gwaihir> that's a good point, telling people who switch from the previous LTS

 22:42:08 <alourie> wouldn't it be too interruptive?

 22:42:22 <beuno> on first boot?  once?

 22:42:28 <alourie> well

 22:42:40 <alourie> most users would just click "ok" without reading

 22:42:57 <beuno> the ones who already know, yes

 22:43:10 <beuno> the ones who are suddenly lost, maybe not

 22:43:27 <alourie> hm

 22:43:45 <alourie> "the world changed" announcement. I kinda like it

 22:44:34 <alourie> it could be synced with u.com

 22:45:47 <beuno> first boot?

 22:45:56 <beuno> first time you hit the dash?

 22:46:00 * beuno hand-waves

 22:46:01 <Gwaihir> during the upgrade also

 22:46:15 <Gwaihir> if people upgrade directly from the LTS

 22:46:21 <beuno> Gwaihir, the thing is, lucid is lucid, shipped

 22:46:25 <beuno> so we can't change that code

 22:46:38 <Gwaihir> true

 22:47:03 <pleia2> #action CC to assemble and get published quick FAQ for "Why Unity?"

 22:47:03 * meetingology CC to assemble and get published quick FAQ for "Why Unity?"

 22:48:22 * AlanBell has sent audit results spreadsheet to the CC

 22:49:30 <dholbach> thanks AlanBell

 22:50:16 <dholbach> any other business?

 22:50:38 <beuno> so, we won a "battle" for being the most popular OSS OS, right?  maybe focus people on the next objective again?   Take over the world?

 22:51:16 <ajmitch> still a battle to remain the most popular

 22:51:47 <dholbach> thanks a lot everyone

 22:51:54 <beuno> o/

 22:51:56 <AlanBell> o/

 22:51:59 * dholbach hugs you all

 22:52:13 <Gwaihir> thanks everyone!

 22:52:41 * beuno listens to czajkowski curse

 22:53:05 <dholbach> haha

 22:53:13 <dholbach> see you tomorrow

 22:53:17 <AlanBell> #endmeeting
