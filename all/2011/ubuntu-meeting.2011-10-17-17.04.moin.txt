 17:04:51 <meetingology> Current chairs: mdeslaur

 17:05:25 <mdeslaur> sbeattie, micahg, jjohansen, tyhicks: ready?

 17:05:31 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: yes

 17:05:34 <micahg> yep

 17:05:39 <jjohansen> \o

 17:07:07 <mdeslaur> OK, I'll go first

 17:07:26 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week. I have a bunch of updates in the queue that needs testing, and should get published this week.

 17:07:38 <mdeslaur> Besides that, I have a few bugs to look at.

 17:07:42 <mdeslaur> That's it. sbeattie, you're next

 17:08:25 <sbeattie> I have a php5 update to go out the door, an embargoed issue to test and release this week.

 17:09:08 <sbeattie> I'm also on community this week and will take jdstrand's triage task in his absence for today, too.

 17:09:30 <sbeattie> That's it for me, micahg?

 17:10:30 <micahg> I've got a small regression in libvoikko due to firefox that I've got to upload, I'll be working on getting oneiric/precise VMs/setup this week, and it's a short week for me, I'm out Thu/Fri

 17:10:46 <micahg> tyhicks: tag

 17:10:53 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week.

 17:11:02 <tyhicks> I'm going to be working on an ecryptfs-utils bug and some eCryptfs kernel bugs reported recently.

 17:11:22 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 17:11:29 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 17:11:53 <jjohansen> I'm in the learning place this week (so I guess that's happy place)

 17:12:20 <jjohansen> I have some new staff tasks to finish off yet, and the kernel cve process to learn

 17:12:40 <jjohansen> and I can always fall back to apparmor bugs, and dev

 17:12:58 <jjohansen> but some how I think I will probably be kept busy

 17:13:03 <sbeattie> jjohansen: welcome to the team!

 17:13:19 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: welcome!

 17:13:24 <jjohansen> good to be here

 17:13:34 <jjohansen> I think that is it from me

 17:14:08 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: back to you?

 17:14:46 <mdeslaur> yep, hold on a sec, I'm generating the highlighted packages

 17:15:27 <micahg> jjohansen: I think as a specialist, you might be in the perpetual happy place :)

 17:15:45 <mdeslaur> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security.
