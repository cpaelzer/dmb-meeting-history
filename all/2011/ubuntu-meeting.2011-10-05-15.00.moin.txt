 15:02:34 <cjwatson> --

 15:02:37 <cjwatson> patch pilot on Tuesday morning

 15:04:49 <slangasek> jhunt: any closer to the bottom on bug #818177? :)

 15:04:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818177 in udev (Ubuntu Oneiric) "boot failures caused by udev race" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818177

 15:05:02 <jhunt> jhunt: no :(

 15:05:12 <slangasek> :(

 15:05:37 <jhunt> problem is partly being able to reproduce the issue.

 15:06:08 <jhunt> adam has a high hit rate, but I set up a system to reboot constantly and didn't get a hit in 25 reboots.

 15:06:20 <slangasek> right

 15:06:29 <doko> ok, ready

 15:06:32 <slangasek> can he give you console access to his system?

 15:06:37 <jhunt> I've tried lots of lvms, lots of plain disks.

 15:06:56 <cjwatson> might help to widen the race by deliberately slowing down some relevant udev rules?

 15:07:22 <cjwatson> usually a helpful tactic with race conditions

 15:07:37 <jhunt> I'll try that. I've tried slowing down some *disks* but that didn't help :)

 15:08:37 <cjwatson> incidentally somebody posted to ubuntu-users with a problem opening /root/dev/console; they say that they fixed it by fscking

 15:08:46 <cjwatson> dunno if that's relevant ...

 15:09:21 <jhunt> hmmm

 15:09:39 <cjwatson> admittedly that was with 10.04, and it's not quite your same bug

 15:09:50 <cjwatson> so ignore if it's a distraction :)

 15:10:03 <slangasek> fscking!

 15:10:06 <jhunt> I'll keep it in mind.

 15:10:09 <jhunt> :)

 15:10:32 <slangasek> doko: go ahead

 15:10:51 <doko> - some last ftbfs fixes (xdotool, ruby-rails, ghdl, mmpong, xzgv, qcontrol)

 15:10:51 <doko> - OpenJDK6 fixes for armel, IcedTea-Web update

 15:10:51 <doko> - start working on toolchain updates for the p-series

 15:10:51 <doko> - propose to better handle library syncs from experimental (ubuntu-devel)

 15:10:51 <doko> - document new compiler flags: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompilerFlags

 15:10:52 <doko> - write up https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P-SeriesOpening

 15:10:54 <doko> done

 15:11:47 <cjwatson> heh, I'd actually like perl 5.14 but only if Debian does it first ...

 15:12:32 <cjwatson> (Debian #637809)

 15:12:33 <doko> right, was just looking for an example for each section ;)

 15:12:33 <ubottu> Debian bug 637809 in release.debian.org "transition: perl 5.14" [Normal,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/637809

 15:13:09 <doko> would like to get some feedback on this list, but maybe after the lightning round

 15:13:56 <cjwatson> the list looked OK although we should do debhelper early as well

 15:14:31 <doko> right, my intention is to write to u-d, to have people add things

 15:15:06 <cjwatson> should probably only list things that block general opening though

 15:15:46 <slangasek> thanks for the mail about experimental libraries too, I hope we'll see some improvement in how those are handled this cycle

 15:16:33 <slangasek> me next:

 15:21:13 <stgraber> - Did a few last minute uploads for Edubuntu (translation update and bugfix)

 15:21:16 <stgraber> - Mostly poked at Ubiquity this bug, trying to fix as many bugs as possible, will continue for the rest of the week

 15:21:19 <stgraber> - Support gsettings (bug 800760), copy Network Manager networks to the target, hopefully fix bug 657086 for good, http proxy support, ...

 15:21:22 <stgraber> - Trying to get WebLive to work on Oneiric, an appserv is online since yesterday but I now have to port some of the arkose hacks and freenx/x2go to work on Oneiric

 15:21:25 <stgraber> - Played a bit more with Drupal over the weekend, should have all the QA modules EXCEPT the ISO tracker ported to Drupal 7 quite soon. Then to start poking at the ISO tracker :)

 15:21:31 <stgraber> - Edubuntu smoke testing (images currently building) and upgrade testing

 15:25:03 <ev> - Helped John update the screenshots for the 11.10 download tour and showed

 15:25:04 <ev> him how the release announcement is done in update-manager.

 15:25:04 <ev> - Released a new slideshow with updated translations at the request of the

 15:25:04 <ev> Lithuanian team.

 15:25:05 <ev> - Created a patch to ubiquity and partman-auto to account for swap size and

 15:25:05 <ev> the installation size when calculating the bounds of the partition resizing.

 15:25:05 <ev> Previously we were going with whatever partman-auto threw at us, which was

 15:25:06 <ev> often too small to hold Ubuntu (bug 769350).  Merges awaiting review.

 15:25:06 <ev> - Call with mvo and Rick on improving the development cycle. Lots of really

 15:25:06 <ev> good plans from Rick and Jason on this front. I'm quite excited to see the

 15:25:07 <ev> final work discussed at UDS. I've signed myself up to help cheer and

 15:25:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 769350 in partman-auto (Ubuntu Oneiric) "resized partition size doesn't count swap space size." [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/769350

 15:25:08 <ev> develop.

 15:25:17 <ev> - Follow up chat with John Lea about how this could apply to the approval

 15:25:17 <ev> process for Unity design and engineering.

 15:25:18 <ev> - Reviewed the download page design with John Oxton.

 15:25:18 <ev> - Set up a netbook with a mocked up Windows for John to do further screenshots

 15:25:18 <ev> of the 11.10 installer.

 15:25:19 <ev> - Created a Testing in Ubuntu event for the Wednesday night at UDS with the

 15:25:19 <slangasek> barry: that quickly issue was an interesting one... glad to see it was package-specific :)

 15:25:19 <ev> assistance of Marianna and Jorge, following the call with Rick and mvo.  You

 15:25:19 <ev> should all come and give five minute talks:

 15:25:19 <ev> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-P/TestingInUbuntu

 15:25:20 <ev> There will be free beer and pizza.  What more could you want?

 15:25:31 <ev> - After helping Sian direct our PR agency on how to get the 11.10 Beta when

 15:25:31 <ev> they were woefully lost in the depths of the Ubuntu Forums, I had a

 15:25:32 <barry> slangasek: me too! :)

 15:25:32 <ev> discussion with John about getting the milestones displayed in the same

 15:25:32 <ev> download page structure as the regular releases, for 12.04.  With a big

 15:25:32 <ev> warning that this is a pre-release and the final version will come in April,

 15:25:33 <ev> of course. We can do better than a link that's buried in the Google results

 15:25:33 <ev> that points to a complex wiki page that in turn points to a complex cdimage

 15:25:33 <ev> page with no instruction on burning a CD or USB disk until you're deep in

 15:25:33 <ev> paragraphs and paragraphs of text.  This should be a job for the web team,

 15:25:34 <ev> anyway.

 15:25:36 <mvo> meh, I forgot to add this call to my report, thanks ev for mentioning it!

 15:25:43 <ev> - In VirtualBox and Windows 7 hell.  The former lost sight of the Windows 7

 15:25:43 <ev> disk, despite it being just fine, and the latter refused to boot when I

 15:25:43 <ev> tried any of the snapshots I've made over the past few months.  The Windows

 15:25:44 <ev> install CD is crashing at boot.  Will hopefully have something sorted

 15:25:44 <ev> sharpish so I can fix Wubi bugs.

 15:25:44 <ev> - Fixed the focusing of labels when we're in a screen reader profile (bug

 15:25:45 <ev> 856782, bug 856773).

 15:25:45 <ev> - Fixed a crasher around the ubiquity keyboard query (bug 865493) and a UI

 15:25:46 <ev> issue with the keyboard test entry (bug 862309).

 15:25:46 <ev> - Tried time and time again to fix the killing of update-apt-cache (bug

 15:25:46 <ev> 743359). Colin got it in the end - thanks!

 15:25:47 <ev> (done)

 15:25:47 <ev> apols for the ranting :)

 15:25:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 856773 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Welcome Screen: Cannot reach 'release notes' link with keyboard only." [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/856773

 15:25:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 865493 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Hitting print screen or possibly closing the keyboard guessing window crashes ubiquity" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/865493

 15:26:13 <mvo> ev: is john interessted in better release announcements for u-m ?

 15:26:21 <slangasek> ev: did the Lithuanian team miss the translation deadline?

 15:26:27 <cjwatson> should be a job for the web team> er, only if they're prepared to be involved in cdimage maintenance :)

 15:26:41 <slangasek> if so... that's not the first time

 15:26:46 <ev> mvo: very much so

 15:26:48 <cjwatson> it is indeed not

 15:26:54 <mvo> ev: cooool!

 15:27:03 <ev> he has a task for improving the download experience

 15:27:04 <cjwatson> oh, wait, download page != releases.ubuntu.com index

 15:27:07 <ev> which includes upgrades

 15:27:10 <ev> you should get in touch :)

 15:27:27 <cjwatson> yeah, download page => web team, sorry for my confusion

 15:27:29 <ev> cjwatson: we should leave releases.ubuntu.com alone

 15:27:32 <ev> indeed

 15:27:40 <ev> and just have the ubuntu website point at the right ISO

 15:27:42 <mvo> ev: absolutely, thanks for this! code-wise, it should be all ready I think, good content is missing

 15:27:59 <ev> slangasek: they did not

 15:28:06 <ev> I failed to do an 11th hour upload

 15:28:19 <ev> I had done one the day before the deadline

 15:28:36 <cjwatson> speaking of 11th hour translation uploads, I need to do gfxboot-theme-ubuntu nowish because there was a late string change from server ...

 15:28:46 <slangasek> ev: ah, ok then :)

 15:28:49 <cjwatson> (I did the string change last week or so, but would like to catch up on translations now)

 15:28:59 <slangasek> Windows install CD is crashing at boot - haha

 15:29:31 <ev> I love that step 1 of the "to fix the problem" steps is "insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer"

 15:29:38 <slangasek> for all the bugs we've ever seen, I don't think we've ever had *that* problem ;)

 15:29:44 <cjwatson> ev: what's the brief state of the wubi at the moment?  it's the only thing where I'm not entirely sure whether we're showstopper-free at the moment

 15:29:58 <ev> cjwatson: I *think* we're largely okay

 15:30:04 <ev> jibel has been testing it a bit

 15:30:10 <ev> and I've been running through it as often as possible

 15:30:13 <cjwatson> I noticed a few bugs recently, but they didn't seem horribly serious

 15:30:17 <ev> pretty quiet on the bugs front

 15:30:17 <ev> i

 15:30:18 <ev> ndeed

 15:30:23 <skaet> ev, does it make sense to get a signed copy ready now then?

 15:30:28 <ev> I'm trying to get a quick fix in for the plymouth splash one

 15:30:52 <ev> skaet: that's an excellent idea - but I'm going to wait until early next week

 15:31:05 <ev> just so I can get these sorts of tiny fixes in

 15:31:10 <ev> and then I'll ask James to take care of that

 15:31:12 <skaet> ev, ok. thanks.

 15:31:19 <ev> so we have it ready way ahead of release

 15:31:44 <slangasek> ev: what's the plymouth splash issue, OOI?

 15:31:46 <cjwatson> early next week> when are we planning to build candidate images though?

 15:31:56 <slangasek> is that 862007?

 15:32:14 <ev> incidentally, fairly quiet on the wubi bugs front.  Once we have the metrics server running early doors in 12.04, I think that will dramatically change our confidence in it

 15:32:18 <ev> and the crash server, obviously

 15:32:31 <ev> yes, bug 862007

 15:32:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 862007 in Wubi "Wubi preinstalled image first boot should use 'quiet splash'" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/862007

 15:32:33 <ev> tiny

 15:32:40 <ev> and could probably do it in trunk and just build

 15:32:48 <ev> but it's always good to test these things :)

 15:32:54 <slangasek> dramatically change our confidence> I hope you mean "For the better" :)

 15:32:59 <ev> yes

 15:33:03 <mvo> *xough*

 15:33:06 <mvo> cough even

 15:33:19 <ev> even in the absence of bug reports, we'll know how many wubi installs are succeeding or failing

 15:33:25 <ev> and where

 15:33:30 <slangasek> skaet: when are you planning to start build candidate images?

 15:33:32 <skaet> cjwatson, first set of candidate issues on thursday/friday after langpacks land,  then turn on official, on next monday and rebuild full set.

 15:33:34 <ev> it will be a brave new world

 15:33:40 <slangasek> ok

 15:33:45 <skaet> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReleaseProcess

 15:33:55 <slangasek> skaet: since wubi goes on the CDs, that means we need a signed copy by then...

 15:34:46 <ev> ah okay

 15:34:47 <skaet> slangasek,  so it seems.   Right now calling for rleease minus 3 days,  but better if earlier.

 15:34:51 <cjwatson> so how about we just sign as we go along

 15:34:59 <ev> yes, I'll talk to james

 15:34:59 <cjwatson> I think the process is faster now

 15:35:05 <skaet> thanks.

 15:35:12 <slangasek> ev: great, thanks :)

 15:35:15 <ev> err, IS seems to have fled

 15:35:30 <ev> must have realized we have a release coming up and all decided to take holiday

 15:35:35 <cjwatson> wise decision

 15:35:39 <ev> lol

 15:35:50 <slangasek> [ACTION] ev to talk to james about getting wubi builds signed as we go so we don't hold up CD candidates

 15:35:50 * meetingology` ev to talk to james about getting wubi builds signed as we go so we don't hold up CD candidates

 15:36:46 <slangasek> btw, speaking of holidays and releases, next Monday is a bank holiday here in the US

 15:37:08 <barry> slangasek: yep.  i swapped the day, so i will be working

 15:37:11 <ev> Arbor Day?

 15:37:19 <barry> columbus day

 15:37:25 <ev> oh, that dude

 15:37:35 <barry> yeah, go figure :)

 15:37:40 <ev> :)

 15:37:41 <slangasek> I'm off... which I guess means I'll only be working on the release in my free time? :)

 15:38:00 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:38:27 <slangasek> bdmurray: find any interesting specimens for us this week?

 15:38:32 <bdmurray> So I had a few in mind but it seems we move too fast and they are already be looked at

 15:38:53 <bdmurray> Luckily there are still a couple

 15:39:26 <bdmurray> bug 856055 - which I'm not quite certain that should be High

 15:39:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 856055 in memtest86+ (Ubuntu) "Memtest run from DI installer menu never finishes" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/856055

 15:39:36 <ev> ...it never did?

 15:39:48 <cjwatson> mm, I think that should probably be downgraded, it's hardware-specific

 15:39:49 <doko> strange definition of luck ...

 15:40:06 <cjwatson> no obvious fix upstream and I don't think any of us have a clue how to fix it ::)

 15:40:09 <cjwatson> :)

 15:40:15 <cjwatson> I'll downgrade it

 15:40:28 <bdmurray> okay sounds good

 15:40:57 <bdmurray> slangasek: we'd talked about bug 859188 once before but I don't think I commented on it well enough

 15:40:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 859188 in apt (Ubuntu) "E: Internal Error, No file name for libgl1-mesa-glx" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/859188

 15:41:30 <bdmurray> so if you could have at it that'd be great

 15:42:12 <slangasek> mvo: shall I add this to your pile? :)  apt-get install --reinstall doesn't work in the obvious manner when there's more than one arch for the lib

 15:43:15 <slangasek> commented

 15:43:22 <mvo> slangasek: thanks, I can have a look

 15:43:41 <bdmurray> that's all then

 15:44:07 <slangasek> mvo: "low" is the right priority though IMHO, it's a seldom-used option and there's a workaround

 15:44:19 <mvo> ok

 15:44:49 <cjwatson> does anyone have any absolute showstoppers they want to mention?

 15:45:13 <cjwatson> right now I think bug 857472 is the only one I think qualifies

 15:45:15 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 857472 in apt (Ubuntu Oneiric) "net-update verifcation checking insecure" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/857472

 15:45:15 <mvo> I would appreciate some review of #857472

 15:45:22 <mvo> heh :)

 15:45:37 <slangasek> or anyone still working on *non* showstoppers that they're anxious to get in?

 15:45:42 <cjwatson> but I'd like to be able to stand up in the release meeting on Friday and be confident of that

 15:45:48 <mvo> I implemented the approach that slangasek suggested now but given the nature of this I would appreciate critical review

 15:45:58 <cjwatson> I'm still working on bug 590108 as I mentioned

 15:46:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 590108 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "User get wrong system language after executing oem-config, if he is a foreigner in the country he selected in timezone select stage" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/590108

 15:46:21 <cjwatson> but I'm restricting the scope of that to Portuguese and Chinese (i.e. the usual special-case languages)

 15:46:32 <cjwatson> which I think is all the reporters care about)

 15:46:37 <barry> slangasek: scottk requested a merge of debian's python3-defaults which is blocking a pyqt fix.  i'm going to get that in after lunch

 15:46:46 <stgraber> I'm looking at a few ubiquity bugs but nothing that we absolutely need for release

 15:47:14 <cjwatson> I also want to land the fix for the libdevel-bt-perl build failure that kees and I put together to complete the perl 5.12 transition, but that's universe and non-urgent

 15:47:17 <ev> I'm going to land the resize fix now and do a new ubiquity upload

 15:47:47 <stgraber> ev: I may have one more gsettings fix I'd like to have in that ubiquity upload, what's your ETA?

 15:48:10 <ev> stgraber: planning to leave at 6pm local (just over an hour)

 15:48:24 <cjwatson> bug 745960 and bug 854837 are my other nice-to-have fixes, but if I run out of time, they aren't showstoppers

 15:48:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 745960 in grub2 (Ubuntu Oneiric) "Cannot boot grub after installing to LVM" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/745960

 15:48:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854837 in casper (Ubuntu Oneiric) "Lubuntu live image boots to TTY" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854837

 15:48:29 <jhunt> bug 818177 is pretty nasty as we don't really know what's triggering the problem and it does cause boot failures.

 15:48:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818177 in udev (Ubuntu Oneiric) "boot failures caused by udev race" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818177

 15:48:46 <stgraber> ev: ok, I'll see if I can get it fixed by then, otherwise it'll have to be in the next ubiquity upload (assuming we'll have one more ;))

 15:48:54 <slangasek> mvo: has anyone from the security team reviewed for 857472?  I'd be more confident in their review than my own

 15:48:55 <cjwatson> jhunt: I agree it's nasty, it's on the edge of my mental showstopper criteria

 15:49:04 <ev> stgraber: sure - do feel free to upload another one after me

 15:49:13 <mvo> slangasek: I will ask them

 15:49:31 <cjwatson> the thing that puts it on the non-showstopper side for me right now is lack of developer ability to reproduce; if you can get a reliable reproduction case I'd be more comfortable calling it a showstopper

 15:49:44 <skaet> am a little worried about 848915,  since from duplicate patterns it was happening as recently as yesterday.

 15:49:53 <slangasek> mvo: ok.  If they aren't going to get to it, come back to me and I'll have another look so we at least have some eyeballs on it

 15:49:57 <cjwatson> bug 848915

 15:49:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 848915 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "update-manager crashed with RuntimeError in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gtk.py: Gtk couldn't be initialized" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/848915

 15:50:04 <cjwatson> mvo: ^?

 15:50:19 <mvo> cjwatson: this sounds like DISPLAY is not set

 15:50:33 <cjwatson> hm, you've commented I see

 15:51:24 <mvo> cjwatson: this was the only way I managed to reproduce

 15:51:25 <cjwatson> distinctly odd since the reporters seem to be using the GTK frontend though

 15:51:28 <bdmurray> duplicate bug 867629 has a test case

 15:51:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 848915 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "duplicate for #867629 update-manager crashed with RuntimeError in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gtk.py: Gtk couldn't be initialized" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/848915

 15:51:39 <cjwatson> surely they couldn't have got that far ...

 15:51:42 <mvo> bdmurray: oh, nice!

 15:52:17 <mvo> bdmurray: gksu then most likely

 15:53:07 <cjwatson> yeah, gksu will be sanitising the environment

 15:53:27 <slangasek> yeah, why would gksu need DISPLAY...

 15:53:32 <slangasek> :)

 15:55:34 <slangasek> someone's triaging that one to gksu then?  someone want to work on it?

 15:55:44 <jhunt> bdmurray, cjwatson, mvo: maybe apport could be changed to include DISPLAY in 'ProcEnviron'?

 15:55:47 <mvo> I can have a look in a little bit

 15:56:15 <slangasek> mvo: thanks

 15:56:40 <slangasek> jhunt++

 15:56:56 <jhunt> in fact, can't we just include all envar *names*?

 15:57:41 <slangasek> bdmurray, jhunt: can you follow up on that question on #ubuntu-devel?

 15:57:45 <cjwatson> slangasek: at this point I'd be more comfortable with a workaround than with changing gksu

 15:57:54 <slangasek> cjwatson: ok

 15:57:56 <slangasek> mvo: ^^

 15:58:11 <mvo> ok

 15:58:36 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:58:42 <slangasek> anything else?  You have 1 minute :)

 15:58:44 <cjwatson> (e.g. env DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" or whatever's appropriate)

 15:58:53 <ev> I can't believe I have to repeat the words "free beer and pizza", but free beer and pizza: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-P/TestingInUbuntu

 15:58:53 <ev> In all seriousness, I'm trying to build off the excitement and planning around refining our development process, as we centre it around test systems.  We'll need plenty of knowledge sharing to do this right.

 15:59:39 <mvo> ev++

 15:59:59 <cjwatson> I'll see what my energy levels are like by Wednesday ...

 16:00:02 * cjwatson <- old man

 16:00:05 <ev> I joined a few folks in Millbank representing Ubuntu at the PC World Awards.  We didn't win, but rest assured we made more noise at the mispronunciation of our name than any other table.

 16:00:25 <cjwatson> haha

 16:00:27 <slangasek> so go sign up to exchange pizza for the contents of your brains at UDS :)

 16:00:31 <cjwatson> fun black tie dinner?

 16:00:32 <ev> basically, yes

 16:00:33 <slangasek> ev: heh :)

 16:00:37 <ev> it was!

 16:00:40 <barry> ev: gluten free soy cheese pizza? :)

 16:01:08 <ev> barry: ask Marianna :)

 16:01:19 <ev> I'm sure we can find something for you to eat

 16:01:38 <barry> ev: well, it's orlando, i'm not so sure :)

 16:01:40 <mvo> remember the veggies

 16:02:12 <ev> mmm vegetarians
