 00:01:35 <meetingology> Meeting started Fri Sep 16 00:01:35 2011 UTC.  The chair is cyphermox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AlanBell/mootbot.

 00:01:58 <cyphermox> #topic Ubuntu Membership

 00:02:10 <cyphermox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for September 15, 2011. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:02:46 <cyphermox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 00:03:06 <cyphermox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:03:15 <cyphermox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:03:30 <cyphermox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:03:57 <cyphermox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:04:14 <cyphermox> #voters cyphermox Pendulum pleia2 beuno n0rman greg-g dinda1

 00:04:14 <meetingology> Warning: Nick not in channel: greg-g

 00:04:14 <meetingology> Current voters: Pendulum beuno cyphermox dinda1 greg-g n0rman pleia2

 00:04:33 <cyphermox> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:05:02 <cyphermox> I think we'll actually skip tenach until he shows up ;)

 00:05:14 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for Joe Liau (JoeVancouver)

 00:06:39 <JoeVancouver> Hello, I am here. The link to my wiki is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoeLiau

 00:06:56 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoeLiau

 00:07:00 * pleia2 thinks JoeVancouver looks suspiciously like a jawa

 00:07:13 <JoeVancouver> :) I'm Joe Liau, the "Master Presenter" for Ubuntu Vancouver LoCo (UVLC). I've been an Ubuntu contributor for 2 years, primarily as one of the core members of UVLC. I have also participated in Ubuntu forums, bug reporting, and Ubuntu marketing efforts.

 00:09:31 <pleia2> JoeVancouver: thinking of making an update U video with Unity screenshots? :)

 00:09:49 <JoeVancouver> Yes, I would like to re-create a video like that

 00:10:02 <dinda1> Looks like the UVLC is quite active

 00:10:02 <JoeVancouver> It is quite out of date

 00:10:21 <JoeVancouver> Yes, UVLC is active. The video is out of date :P

 00:11:00 <pleia2> JoeVancouver: what inspired you to join your LoCo?

 00:12:09 <JoeVancouver> I am naturally drawn to communities, and I enjoy helping others. When I joined the LoCo it was really starting to emerge and grow, and I wanted to part of that action.

 00:12:22 <pleia2> cool

 00:13:15 <cyphermox> I think all the board members are ready to vote, so...

 00:15:19 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for Jim Fisher (jedijf)

 00:15:25 <jedijf> Hi. My name is Jim Fisher, jedijf on irc. I sell bread. I am a geek.

 00:15:25 <jedijf> I am 47 years old, and stay young by promoting Ubuntu wherever and

 00:15:25 <jedijf> as often as I can. I like to be challenged, and am always looking

 00:15:25 <jedijf> for projects that Ubuntu can be a part of. I like coffee, espresso,

 00:15:26 <jedijf> and redbull.

 00:15:42 <pleia2> a jawa and now a jedi

 00:15:42 <jedijf> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Jedijf

 00:15:55 <cyphermox> and we have our own Princess Leia :D

 00:16:05 <pleia2> star wars theme here at the americas board meeting tonight :)

 00:16:14 <jedijf> ++

 00:16:40 <cyphermox> jedijf: you sell bread. do you take orders for bread in the ubuntu logo? ;D

 00:16:52 <jedijf> i have and do!

 00:17:05 <jedijf> pleia2: can prolly find it faster than i

 00:17:34 <JonathanD> I'd like to mention the following. I organize and execute a number of events annually in the Philly area with a foss orientation. jedijf has been instrumental to fosscon, a foss conference we held here this summer, as well as multiple of our geeknic picnics (he has very graciously provided baked goods to these events, as well.)

 00:17:43 <dinda1> I just followed the links to the NTR project - very nice

 00:17:55 <JonathanD> I consider him a pillar of the Philadelphia FOSS community.

 00:18:02 <cyphermox> great!

 00:18:12 <jedijf> dinda1: i plan on restarting that

 00:18:41 <pleia2> my finding fu fails me, but ubuntu bread did exist

 00:18:50 <jedijf> it took ntr a bit to come around to the concepts we were showing them

 00:19:00 <jedijf> pleia2: that'll be my first planet blog

 00:19:03 <jedijf> :)

 00:19:13 <pleia2> for the record, jedijf was instrumental in getting *me* more involved in my first loco :)

 00:19:15 <cyphermox> jedijf: I see the last event in your page was about a year ago, I suspect that it's just an oversight, since fosscon was mentioned now?

 00:19:20 <pleia2> so he's to blame for all of this

 00:19:23 <cyphermox> pleia2: oh

 00:19:37 <JonathanD> Fosscon was in July.

 00:19:49 <cyphermox> JonathanD: thanks. That's what I suspected :)

 00:19:52 <jedijf> cyphermox: i stopped branding my events as loco events, but now that i am team contact there will be more LoCo follow thru

 00:20:28 <jedijf> i am kinda baranded the ubuntu guy throughout all of my affiliations

 00:20:38 <jedijf> branded

 00:20:43 <cyphermox> :)

 00:21:04 <dinda1> you've got some great endorsements

 00:21:12 <cyphermox> okay, we're convinced it's voting time :)

 00:21:14 <jedijf> i've got great people around me

 00:21:23 <jedijf> and some who only come back to visit

 00:34:58 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for José Antonio Rey (JoseeAntonioR)

 00:35:07 <JoseeAntonioR> Hello everyone. My name is José Antonio Rey. I am 14 years old, and I am located in Peru. My wiki link is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoseeAntonioR

 00:35:36 <JoseeAntonioR> Sorry, but I have testimonials in Spanish.

 00:35:48 <pleia2> no problem, google translate helps :)

 00:35:50 <cyphermox> it's fine for me, good practice :)

 00:36:14 <JoseeAntonioR> :)

 00:36:23 <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: does your school use Ubuntu yet?

 00:36:41 <JoseeAntonioR> Not actually. With Diopj4, we've been trying to introduce it.

 00:36:54 <JoseeAntonioR> The principal did not paid much attention to the project.

 00:37:08 <JoseeAntonioR> He said he was focusing on another thing, but we're trying again in 2 weeks (:

 00:37:28 <JoseeAntonioR> Diopj4 is here, in case you need his testimonial.

 00:38:17 <pleia2> hello Diopj4 :)

 00:38:44 <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: I know how difficult it can be here in the US to get Ubuntu in to schools, it's great to see people making the effort elsewhere too

 00:38:44 <Diopj4> hello (:

 00:38:47 <fernandodx15> I'm in his school too

 00:39:03 <pleia2> wow, great

 00:39:35 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 Actually, I'm trying to expand the use of Ubuntu in all Peru.

 00:39:52 <pleia2> Peru has llamas :)

 00:39:55 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 I would like to see a change in the next 2 or 3 years, as there are many options apart from Windows.

 00:40:00 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 Right!

 00:40:37 <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: how long have you been working with Ubuntu?

 00:40:49 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 1 year aproximately.

 00:41:04 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 But I have done a lot of investigation as I had some problems, and I have learnt a lot.

 00:41:06 <dinda1> JoseeAntonioR: are there any organized meetings or events around Ubuntu in your area?

 00:41:28 <JoseeAntonioR> dinda1 The Peruvian LoCo team is not too active, so there aren't many.

 00:41:43 <JoseeAntonioR> dinda1 We're having a conference soon, but Ubuntu is not the main topic.

 00:41:58 <dinda1> can you give us any suggestion how we might help support your effots?

 00:42:31 <JoseeAntonioR> dinda1 I think just having more material on the web would be great.

 00:42:40 <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: are you familiar with spreadubuntu.com ?

 00:42:53 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 Yes, I am. I have printed some posters from there.

 00:42:57 <pleia2> oh good :)

 00:42:58 <dinda1> JoseeAntonioR: yes, I see you've looked at the desktop course - way out date unfortunately :(

 00:43:25 <JoseeAntonioR> dinda1 Oh.

 00:43:30 <pleia2> I know akgraner is working on something now

 00:43:43 <dinda1> JoseeAntonioR: yes and others are hoping to help too

 00:43:52 <pleia2> hopefully we'll have some updated materials this next cycle

 00:43:56 <JoseeAntonioR> In my opinion, having official materian from Canonical to spread Ubuntu would be great.

 00:44:06 <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2 I hope so.

 00:44:12 <dinda1> I have some materials geared toward teachers and school administrators, I'll try to send them to you

 00:44:23 <JoseeAntonioR> dinda1 Great! Thanks!
