 10:27:54 <Destine> amithkk, you really should try to do more.

 10:27:55 <ejat> good to have u ... and nice start as mention by elky ..

 10:28:09 <elky> You seem to have an ok grasp on english, so maybe translations would be fun for you :)

 10:28:22 <amithkk> and i know hindi too

 10:28:27 <amithkk> and kannada

 10:28:30 <amithkk> :D

 10:28:32 <ejat> amithkk: maybe u can do mo advocating / awareness in your school @ neighbourhood :)

 10:28:34 <IdleOne> amithkk: a good thing would be more detail about your contributions on your wiki.

 10:28:38 <elky> I know I love to see lots of translations on applications.

 10:28:39 <Destine> amithkk, and as IdleOne said, get along with LoCo.

 10:28:45 <amithkk> ejat:  I did

 10:29:00 <ejat> yeah .. do some translation might be a good too

 10:29:03 <elky> amithkk, point directly to articles. Even if you have to use the archive.org waybackmachine

 10:29:21 <amithkk> we had a robots.txt :d

 10:29:39 <elky> google has some of your stuff cached too i suspect. search for "amith site:2buntu.com"

 10:30:06 <ejat> amithkk: do updates your wiki then u retry to apply for membership ... no need to rush ... take time ... we always welcome u here :)

 10:30:07 <IdleOne> amithkk: Please take what we are saying as advice and not as complaints. The work you have done so far is good, keep it up but more Ubuntu specific/LoCo work would be awesome.

 10:30:08 <elky> robots.txt should still let search engines in, or the site will not get much love

 10:30:35 <amithkk> IdleOne: Ok no worries

 10:30:52 <amithkk> Anyways to tell the truth, I didn't think id get it

 10:31:06 <Destine> amithkk, keep up your good work and come back later. I wish I will still be on board when you return.
