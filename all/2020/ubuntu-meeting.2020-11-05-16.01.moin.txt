 16:08 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-hh-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:09 <bdmurray> bug 1902025

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1902025 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "hwe kernel not scoped under "Ubuntu Base"" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1902025

 16:09 <bdmurray> xnox ^ I found where this comes from

 16:10 <bdmurray> https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/update-manager/main/view/head:/UpdateManager/Core/UpdateList.py#L385

 16:10 <xnox> oooh

 16:11 <bdmurray> I guess we should probably take this as it doesn't look great.

 16:11 <xnox> i want to take that bug please.

 16:11 <bdmurray> Would you SRU it?

 16:11 <mclemenceau_> ok I'll card it

 16:11 <xnox> bdmurray:  or yeah, whoever takes that, they need to crosscorelate with seeds which list all of th enew kernel package names. I see lots that are missing.

 16:11 <bdmurray> Then I guess bug 1902855 is the one doko mentioned

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1902855 in subiquity (Ubuntu) "two identical disks are only offered as a multipath device" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1902855

 16:12 <doko> yes

 16:12 <bdmurray> xnox: Maybe we should add that to some release check list too

 16:13 <bdmurray> The other 2 on rls-hh we've looked at previously

 16:14 <xnox> bdmurray:  i don't know

 16:14 <doko> tdaitx: instead of retrying, please file a britney bug, that this test shouldn't be triggered

 16:14 <bdmurray> okay, let's card that as it is "interesting"

 16:14 <mclemenceau_> ok

 16:14 <xnox> bdmurray:  maybe we should talk to kernel team to have them have a checklist of what needs doing on kernel flavour adding.... cause there are seeds; sru-reports; kernel-sru tooling; update-manager; etc.

 16:14 <xnox> autopkgtests

 16:14 <xnox> all of them have to learn which things are kernels.....

 16:15 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-gg-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:15 <bdmurray> xnox: If that's part of their process cool

 16:15 <bdmurray> Is there any update on bug 1890435?

 16:15 <xnox> bdmurray:  >_< *giggle* no i don't think it is, but imho it should be. =)

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1890435 in gcc-10 (Ubuntu) "gcc-10 breaks on armhf (flaky): internal compiler error: Segmentation fault" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1890435

 16:16 <doko> <doko> - two more iterations for the armhf issue triggered by gcc-10

 16:16 <bdmurray> got it, thanks

 16:16 <bdmurray> bug 1848829

 16:16 <ubottu> bug 1848829 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "distribution upgrade failed due pip install of distro-info" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1848829

 16:16 <tdaitx> doko: I am/was not sure that their tests are invalid for openjdk (so that removing the trigger is needed), it's just that libreoffice autopkgtests are flaky and they didn't see to be failing due to openjdk, thus the retry

 16:17 <bdmurray> so these people installed the pip version of distro-info which is super old and missing stuff

 16:17 <doko> tdaitx: nothing uses anything else besides the default jre/jdk

 16:17 <xnox> is the distro-info thing similar to "do not use /usr/local" for upgrades?

 16:17 <xnox> as in, do not use pip-installed stuff during upgrades?

 16:17 <bdmurray> yeah, I wonder if the path isn't set properly

 16:17 <xnox> or rather clensed.

 16:18 <tdaitx> doko: duh, of course... I will file the bug for that, thanks

 16:18 <xnox> there is python argument one can pass to ensure the app starts ignoring environment passed path

 16:18 <xnox> such that probably ubuntu-release-upgrader should run by #!/usr/bin/python3 -E or whatever the flag was

 16:18 <xnox> -E     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that

 16:18 <xnox> modify the behavior of the interpreter.

 16:18 <xnox> -E     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that

 16:18 <xnox> modify the behavior of the interpreter.

 16:18 <xnox> bah, soory.

 16:19 <bdmurray> So that would likely help in more situations than just distro-info correct?

 16:19 <xnox> yes

 16:19 <bdmurray> that seems worth doing then as it could fix a lot of stuff we aren't aware of

 16:19 <bdmurray> so let's take that

 16:20 <bdmurray> mclemenceau_: can you card that?

 16:20 <bdmurray> bug 1902260

 16:20 <ubottu> bug 1902260 in livecd-rootfs (Ubuntu) "systemd-detect-virt is missing on Groovy arm64 EC2 AMI " [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1902260

 16:21 <mclemenceau_> yes sir

 16:24 <bdmurray> so let's work with CPC on that

 16:25 <bdmurray> bug 1898342

 16:25 <ubottu> bug 1898342 in grub-installer (Ubuntu) "Bootloader install failed" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1898342

 16:26 <bdmurray> xnox: there's a response there

 16:26 <xnox> ooh

 16:26 <bdmurray> so maybe the tests are wrong?

 16:27 <bdmurray> that seems good for rls-gg

 16:27 <xnox> bdmurray:  maybe confirmed.

 16:27 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:27 <bdmurray> bug 1902760

 16:27 <xnox> bdmurray:  well, not sure we can do rls-gg can we? given we will not respin groovy point release, are we?

 16:27 <ubottu> bug 1902760 in binutils (Ubuntu) "Please merge linker bugfix into Ubuntu 20.04 LTS" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1902760

 16:30 <bdmurray> let's leave that tagged then

 16:35 <bdmurray> I'll look at ubuntu-release-upgrader

 16:35 <bdmurray> Let's individually take a look at the list and see if there is anything we can help out with.

 16:35 <slyon> I think netplan.io / pyyaml is flaky and should be retried

 16:36 <bdmurray> Can someboyd do that for slyon ?

 16:37 <bdmurray> Also next Wednesday is a US holiday, but I'm swapping that as having a Wednesday off seems weird
