 14:02 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:03 <cpaelzer> I had the action from Frankfurt sprint to reork the wiki (you all should have got a mail)

 14:03 <cpaelzer> There is a suggested new page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcessNEW

 14:03 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcessNEW

 14:03 <cpaelzer> That unifies the old chaos of everal places (harder to find and unsure where to look at)

 14:03 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MIRTeam

 14:04 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess

 14:04 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMainInclusionRequirements

 14:04 <cpaelzer> in addition to merging those I have added the review-templates that I've shown in frankfurt

 14:04 <cpaelzer> is anyone against using the new page?

 14:05 <cpaelzer> Once we agree I can do the changes to replace one of the existing pages and have the others refer to it

 14:05 <didrocks> thx for working on that, I have a couple of remarks on the page and unsure how we should fix them

 14:05 <didrocks> for instance, there is a discrepancy between how we give a MIR to the security team and the diagram below

 14:05 <didrocks> the text is:

 14:05 <cpaelzer> didrocks: the content is mostly the same as before - are your remarks new issues or already bad before my sugegsted change?

 14:05 <didrocks> " * They might also delegate portions of the review to other teams, assign it to them, and set it to Incomplete; common cases are getting a thorough security review from the security team "

 14:06 <didrocks> -> the diagram shows only "new" as a valid status though

 14:06 <sarnold> good morning

 14:06 <didrocks> cpaelzer: I think this was pre-existing, but as we consolidate in one page now, it’s more visible :)

 14:06 <cpaelzer> yes didrocks

 14:07 <cpaelzer> in recent times we really only kept incomplete if the bug-reporter had to come back later with tasks

 14:07 <didrocks> (it’s minor, the rest is really really good)

 14:07 <cpaelzer> the security Team was fine to pick the tasks in state "new" as well as long as they are assigned

 14:07 <didrocks> ok, I’ll update the diagram to match this

 14:07 <cpaelzer> na

 14:07 <cpaelzer> didrocks: lets change the text

 14:07 <didrocks> let’s set on incomplete

 14:07 <didrocks> yep

 14:07 <cpaelzer> the diagram is the simpler version

 14:07 <didrocks> ack

 14:07 <cpaelzer> one less state change

 14:08 <doko> hmm, the process is "hidden" after the review description ... maybe should be moved up

 14:09 <doko> we use incomplete for a placeholder bug, missing subscriber, missing stuff in the MIR

 14:09 <cpaelzer> doko: we can makd #4 to become 3.1 would that work better for you?

 14:09 <cpaelzer> doko: yes incomplete is "please comeback once XXX is fulfilled"

 14:09 <cpaelzer> which can be subscribers, or "please add a test" or "needs new version" and such

 14:10 <cpaelzer> doko: I'll move the process states up that is a good suggestion

 14:10 <doko> I would make 4 -> 2

 14:11 <cpaelzer> like an overview before the detail then

 14:11 <cpaelzer> sure that can work as well

 14:11 <doko> yes

 14:11 <cpaelzer> done

 14:12 <cpaelzer> the state chare has incomplete the way we use it

 14:12 <cpaelzer> it is state #7

 14:12 <cpaelzer> it is missing in the long text thou

 14:13 <cpaelzer> I'll add at "Filing a MIR bug" as 4.2

 14:15 <cpaelzer> done

 14:15 <cpaelzer> anything else that anyone wants to change immediately

 14:15 <cpaelzer> it is - after all - a wiki so you can do that at any time

 14:16 <cpaelzer> but I know that this probably is the one time we really read and modify it

 14:16 <cpaelzer> for quite a while

 14:16 <cpaelzer> so is everyone ok now?

 14:16 <cpaelzer> FYI - the one URL that will stay (=the page this unified content will take over) is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess

 14:17 <cpaelzer> and the other two will be come blank referrals (not sure if the wiki allows auto-referral but a link will do as well)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> I'd be bold and consider silence = yes

 14:19 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, good plan :)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> last remarks to hold me back before we go on with the agenda?

 14:19 <sarnold> I really like the new page

 14:19 <sarnold> and removing two others is excellent value :)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold

 14:19 <didrocks> for me, +1 :)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> we realized when introducing ddstreet that we did ourselve not know on which page it was - so the task became obvious :-)

 14:20 <cpaelzer> ok lets go on then

 14:20 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:20 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:20 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:21 <cpaelzer> geoip2 is ready for promotion

 14:21 <cpaelzer> doko: could you do that right away?

 14:21 <doko> sure

 14:21 <cpaelzer> the bug is linked in the svg as usual

 14:21 <cpaelzer> FYI that was the long tail of a geoip -> geoip2 change triggered by the last bind9 updates

 14:22 <cpaelzer> other things worth to mention are libfido2 / libcbor which are worked on

 14:22 <cpaelzer> more interesting for this section of the agenda might be the totally new bits

 14:22 <cpaelzer> doko: I know you asked xnox about the seed change with python-is-... is the "what-is-python" related?

 14:24 <doko> perl don't hurt me

 14:25 <sarnold> don't hurt me, no more

 14:25 <doko> yeah, I'm +0 thats we need that in main ...

 14:25 <cpaelzer> do you know who is driving that?

 14:26 <doko> xnox. I don't care if it's in main or not

 14:26 <cpaelzer> ok he will let us know if he needs anything

 14:26 <cpaelzer> he knows the people and the process

 14:26 <cpaelzer> if we decide to do something abotu it it might be wrong

 14:26 <cpaelzer> he will know better

 14:26 <cpaelzer> next weould be apport depending on terminator

 14:27 <cpaelzer> does anyone know more about that?

 14:29 <cpaelzer> that is from binary apport-gtk

 14:29 <cpaelzer> recent uploads by bdmurray

 14:30 <cpaelzer> for now highlighting him is all that comes to mind, I'd expect him to file a MIR if one is need on  this

 14:30 <cpaelzer> other opinions?

 14:30 <didrocks> I think let’s wait for bdmurray to see his reason, but terminator in main doesn’t really make much sense to me

 14:30 <cpaelzer> doko: are you filing MIRs once you see them in mismatches usually - or are you pinging the uploaders?

 14:30 <cpaelzer> didrocks: maybe it is an unintended pickup of the dependency, the changelog doesn't mention it

 14:31 <didrocks> I think so

 14:31 <cpaelzer> ok next agenda item

 14:31 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I think it may be unrelated to apport itself though -- at least on my lists, apport-gtk Depends: on x-terminal-emulator

 14:31 <cpaelzer> open MIR to assign to us

 14:31 <cpaelzer> sarnold: yes on my focal it has x-terminal-emulator as well

 14:31 <sarnold> cpaelzer: this may be a bug in whatever tool generates the svg, I don't know why terminator specifically was chosen to satisfy this dependency, nor why it recently changed

 14:32 <cpaelzer> sarnold: it has "Provides: x-terminal-emulator"

 14:33 <doko> apport should have a real package as the first alternative

 14:33 <sarnold> doko: ahhhhh

 14:33 <cpaelzer> yep it directly lists it in depnds

 14:34 <cpaelzer> bdmurray: ^^ would you fix that in apport?

 14:34 <cpaelzer> doko: can you carry that to him in whatever the next team meeting is for you?

 14:34 <sarnold> on my big pile of unpacked packages, terminator is only ever mentioned in code, likely as a fallback option http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jK7CgH5JWS/

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:36 <bdmurray> cpaelzer: the foundations team has a trello card to fix component-mismatches iirc

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok thanks bdmurray

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I'll make sure cbor goes forward

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I already did a review and have an open MP I need to review

 14:37 <cpaelzer> to check if it fulfills my needs for 2new version"

 14:37 <cpaelzer> it also is assigned to security

 14:37 <cpaelzer> so no need to add further people to that

 14:37 <cpaelzer> the other two are

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-firmware-raspi2/+bug/1867813

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1867813 in linux-firmware-raspi2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] linux-firmware-raspi2 to restricted" [High,New]

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxd-agent-loader/+bug/1868572

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1868572 in lxd-agent-loader (Ubuntu) "[MIR] lxd-agent-loader" [Undecided,New]

 14:38 <cpaelzer> anyone feeling like picking either of them?

 14:38 <sarnold> for the security part, I think I'd just like to give the binary package a quick re-review after it enters -proposed or similar, just to make sure the usual sanity checks are done

 14:38 <cpaelzer> it seems security has already looked at lxd-agent-loader and it is a trivial package

 14:38 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ack, that comment was for libcbor right?

 14:39 <sarnold> cpaelzer: yes

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I'll do lxd-agent-loader somewhen today or tomorrow

 14:39 <cpaelzer> anyone willing to take https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-firmware-raspi2/+bug/1867813 plese ?

 14:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1867813 in linux-firmware-raspi2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] linux-firmware-raspi2 to restricted" [High,New]

 14:41 <ddstreet> i would, but i already took lp #1868154 and lp #1868159 and don't want to take too many since i'm new to the process

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1868154 in realmd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] realmd" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868154

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1868159 in adcli (Ubuntu) "[MIR] adcli" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868159

 14:42 <cpaelzer> agreed ddstreet

 14:42 <cpaelzer> anyone else?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> doko: this seems to be a foundations-case anyway - would you be able to give this one a look?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I mean 1867813

 14:45 <cpaelzer> it seems everone is busy or unwilling :-/ doko since it is from sil2100 you probably are the closest member anyway - so he will bother you first :-)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> we can wait for an answer int he last section of the meeting

 14:46 <cpaelzer> lets go on for now

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:46 <doko> ugh, not sure how to review that. I'll ask lucascz

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thanks doko

 14:47 <cpaelzer> openstack team seems to work on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/octavia/+bug/1864666 but it is still incomplete and got mentioned to be for 20.10 now

 14:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864666 in python-octavia-lib (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-octavia-lib, ovn-octavia-provider" [Medium,Incomplete]

 14:47 <cpaelzer> no action on that

 14:47 <cpaelzer> for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-instance-connect/+bug/1835114 I know that rbalint is waiting on rharper

 14:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1835114 in ec2-instance-connect (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ec2-instance-connect" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:47 <cpaelzer> neither of the recent incomplete bugs is "for us"

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> this was long already, anything else by any of you?

 14:48 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: I know you wanted second opinions on some reviews - is that ready for discussion?

 14:49 <ddstreet> for lp #1864667

 14:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864667 in neutron (Ubuntu) "[MIR] neutron-ovn-metadata-agent" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1864667

 14:49 <ddstreet> i started review, but as it's a binary pkg from a src already in main, i noted as such, and changed to 'In Progress' waiting for AA to handle it

 14:49 <ddstreet> is that correct procedure?

 14:50 <ddstreet> i haven't got to the other 2 i took for review yet

 14:50 <cpaelzer> yeah, I usuaully do a quick sanity check but other than that new binaries on src-in-main does not need a new MIR

 14:50 <ddstreet> do i need to subscribe any other person/team to the bug, or will an AA see it and handle it?

 14:51 <ddstreet> i.e. putting the new binary pkg into main

 14:51 <cpaelzer> TBH I don#t see that in mismatches

 14:51 <cpaelzer> root@f:~# apt-cache policy neutron-ovn-metadata-agent

 14:51 <sarnold> I think that requires Fix Committed, from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcessNEW

 14:51 <cpaelzer> neutron-ovn-metadata-agent:

 14:51 <ddstreet> i think the binary pkg is still stuck in focal-proposed

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Installed: (none)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Candidate: 2:16.0.0~b2~git2020020712.d5b33ffc77-0ubuntu2

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Version table:

 14:51 <cpaelzer> 2:16.0.0~b2~git2020020712.d5b33ffc77-0ubuntu2 500

 14:51 <cpaelzer> 500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-proposed/main i386 Packages

 14:51 <cpaelzer> it is already done

 14:52 <cpaelzer> I thnik this bug is useless extra effort

 14:52 <ddstreet> ok well it's still good knowledge for me :)

 14:52 <ddstreet> so it should be fix committed?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> well, it is more like "invalid"

 14:52 <ddstreet> ah since no action needed, got it

 14:52 <sarnold> heh I would have thought Fix Released, since it's "resolved by an AA" :)

 14:52 * doko leaves the meeting, have to run for an appointment

 14:53 <cpaelzer> cu doko

 14:53 <ddstreet> doko o/

 14:53 <ddstreet> ok i'll put it into 'fix released' just to avoid confusion about whether it belongs in main or not

 14:53 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: I updated the bug

 14:53 <didrocks> bye doko

 14:53 <cpaelzer> coreycb: will come back if needed

 14:53 <ddstreet> ah ok thnx cpaelzer :)

 14:53 <cpaelzer> ok we are done then ...

 14:53 <cpaelzer> anything else?
