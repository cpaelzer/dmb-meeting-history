 15:14 <teward> if not, i'll carry this over until I hear from rbasak (having some mail delivery problems from Seviper -> my email so i'm missing a lot of messages from the lists, it's my end that's at fault)

 15:19 <sil2100> I missed the first part of the meeting tho

 15:19 <teward> only remaining actions are a holdover from rafaeldtinoco and rbasak's being held over because E:NotHere

 15:20 <rafaeldtinoco> I have one thing

 15:20 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: go ahead :)

 15:20 <rafaeldtinoco> I got lots of packages that should be in openstack pkgset

 15:20 <rafaeldtinoco> its updated by hand...

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> (from Chris, which we promoted to PPU last week or so, for the openstack pkgset)

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> I still have to finish this, could you add as an action ?

 15:21 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: do you need help with it, or just want me to add it as an action item?

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> I have to go over packages to check if they're already in other pkgsets, and decide which one is better to keep

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: for now, just an action item pls

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> if I need help I'll drop an email

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> to our dmb list

 15:21 <rafaeldtinoco> sorry for the late notice in the meeting

 15:22 <teward> "rafaeldtinoco to go through openstack packageset and identify packages in other sets and determine which is best to keep" that sound good?

 15:22 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: no worries, it's why I left AOB open ;)

 15:22 <teward> and didn't end the meeting early
