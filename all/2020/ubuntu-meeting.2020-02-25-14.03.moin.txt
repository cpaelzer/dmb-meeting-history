 14:03 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Feb 25 14:03:45 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:03 <meetingology> 

 14:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:04 <cpaelzer> We've had one action which was Laney to work with didrocks to complete the tool for the OEm-meta packages

 14:04 <cpaelzer> that was completed let me fetch some links to show you as FYI

 14:04 <cpaelzer> https://code.launchpad.net/~laney/ubuntu-archive-tools/oem-meta/+merge/379728

 14:05 <cpaelzer> based on that this morning they started to add the first package and wanted to see if it is in proposed mismatches

 14:05 <cpaelzer> The full defined "special case" is here:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MIRTeam/Exceptions/OEM

 14:05 <cpaelzer> That much for the past

 14:05 <cpaelzer> lets go to current cases

 14:05 <cpaelzer> first the link that doko already has mentioned just before we started "officially"

 14:05 <cpaelzer> #link: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:06 <cpaelzer> anyone having any context on those mismatches and/or seen MIRs for them?I tihnk nfs-ganesha / ntirpc exist ...

 14:06 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-ganesha/+bug/1843403

 14:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1843403 in ntirpc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nfs-ganesha, ntirpc" [High,New]

 14:07 <doko> joeubuntu: the openssh ones are targeted for 20.04

 14:07 <cpaelzer> both got security Team acks recently

 14:07 <doko> rbalint was touching nfs ...

 14:08 <doko> ahh, no, openstack

 14:08 <cpaelzer> jamespage: in fact https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-ganesha/+bug/1843403 seems ready now

 14:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1843403 in ntirpc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nfs-ganesha, ntirpc" [High,New]

 14:08 <cpaelzer> MIR ack + security Ack

 14:08 <cpaelzer> was there anything missing or can we ask doko to promote it now?

 14:08 <joeubuntu> doko,  I don't see any OpenSSH ones, do you have a link?

 14:09 <joeubuntu> we ack'd Zsys yesterday.

 14:09 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: I guess there is no MIR bug yet

 14:09 <doko> joeubuntu: see the .svg above

 14:09 <cpaelzer> libfido2 and libcbor

 14:10 <doko> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1864439

 14:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864439 in libfido2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libfido2, libcbor (dependencies of openssh)" [Undecided,New]

 14:10 <joeubuntu> thanks!

 14:10 <cpaelzer> cjwatson: this came in via the new openssh (thanks BTW) are you going to file MIR requests for libfido2 and libcbor or is this intended to go a different path?

 14:10 <doko> cpaelzer: can nfs-ganesha, ntirpc be promoted?

 14:10 <cpaelzer> oh there are - where have you found that fido MIR doko

 14:10 * cpaelzer is reading

 14:11 <cpaelzer> doko: yes nfs-ganesha and ntirpc can be promoted, just double check if the team subscription is really present

 14:11 <doko> cpaelzer: yes, already asked him, should be promoted for two-factor auth

 14:11 <cpaelzer> yeah I know the use case, just didn#t know that something was filed

 14:11 <cpaelzer> doko: Thanks for doing already the MIR part on 1864439

 14:11 <cpaelzer> so this is on joeubuntu now right?

 14:12 <cpaelzer> python-tabulate also has a bug => https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-tabulate/+bug/1862773

 14:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1862773 in python-tabulate (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-tabulate (dependency of cinder)" [High,New]

 14:12 <cpaelzer> also on security

 14:12 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: coudl you confirm that libfido2 libcbor and python-tabulate are in your queue ?

 14:14 <cpaelzer> doko: the subscriptions on nfs-ganesha and ntirpc are ok (openstack team) - can you promote this?

 14:14 <doko> just done

 14:14 <cpaelzer> thank you

 14:14 <joeubuntu> cpaelzer not python-tabulate

 14:15 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: this is for the new cinder driven by jamespage - see bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-tabulate/+bug/1862773

 14:15 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1862773 in python-tabulate (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-tabulate (dependency of cinder)" [High,New]

 14:15 <joeubuntu> I'll add it in.

 14:15 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: could you add it and sync with jamespage on the timing of it to match what is needed for openstack?

 14:15 <cpaelzer> ok - the last one in the list is alsa-lib - anybody heard of that one if it is intentional?

 14:16 <joeubuntu> cpaelzer sure

 14:16 <doko> apparently, desktop just asking kernel for a take over on -devel ;p

 14:16 <doko> didrocks: could you review?

 14:17 <cpaelzer> ok leaving that to -desktop for now ...

 14:17 <cpaelzer> I have one more case that doesn't show up in component-mismatches yet but is important for jamespage (for ceph) as well as rafaeldtinoco (for server HA)

 14:17 <cpaelzer> FYI https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph-iscsi/+bug/1854362

 14:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1854362 in python-configshell-fb (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ceph-iscsi, tcmu, python-configshell-fb, python-rtslib-fb, urwid, targetcli-fb" [Undecided,In progress]

 14:17 <cpaelzer> this is being worked on and passed the MIR reviews

 14:18 <cpaelzer> jamespage: updated a few packages as needed already

 14:18 <cpaelzer> rafaeldtinoco: and jamespage: ware working on targetcli-fb to be updated as well

 14:18 <cpaelzer> the main remaining effort is on joeubuntu and security again

 14:18 <cpaelzer> this morning amurray has checked the case and it should be in your queues now joeubuntu

 14:19 <cpaelzer> targetcli-fb needs to be updated before your review (as it will add another daemon)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: does that make sense when you look at your queues?

 14:19 <joeubuntu> It takes time. but we've got a number of people working on MIRs.

 14:19 <joeubuntu> yes

 14:19 <cpaelzer> yeah, this is the time in the yeah when everyone realizes he needs MIR and security reviews

 14:20 <cpaelzer> lets check the old/incomplete cases then

 14:20 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:20 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:20 <cpaelzer> we've talked about jeepney already and ec2-instance-connect is going on between security and rbalint

 14:20 <cpaelzer> nothing for us to unblock here

 14:21 <cpaelzer> the rest in this list is old news

 14:21 <doko> ok

 14:21 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:21 <cpaelzer> well I mentioned the OEM MIR excuse wiki already

 14:21 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:21 * cpaelzer sees jamespage and didrocks recover a lot of backlog here later on :-)

 14:22 <cpaelzer> ok, nothing else it seems

 14:22 <cpaelzer> ah the addition of new team members

 14:23 <cpaelzer> I see https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir/+members#active was cleaned

 14:23 <cpaelzer> doko: can you add ddstreet there?

 14:23 <cpaelzer> We can give him a onboarding session in Frankfurt then if he wants to

 14:23 <doko> cpaelzer: I'd like to discuss this in Frankfurt first

 14:23 <cpaelzer> this order works for me as well

 14:24 <cpaelzer> ok, closing the meeting then

 14:24 <cpaelzer> hopefully seeing you all in person next week then

 14:24 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
