 15:30 <cpaelzer> let us also take some time here for everyone to see the ping / remember the meeting and show up :-)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> so what is in mismatches for us this week

 15:31 <didrocks> hey :)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> non proposed is clean

 15:31 <doko> o/

 15:31 <cpaelzer> with only known issues and known false positives

 15:31 <cpaelzer> thank jamespage for filing bugs on all the django triggere cases

 15:31 <sarnold> I think it's nothing new

 15:32 <cpaelzer> yeah I'm not identifying anything new on there either

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I've seen some in my inbox, this might be more today

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:32 <doko> time to promote postgresql?

 15:32 <doko> -13

 15:32 <cpaelzer> doko: I'm working through the test issues currently

 15:32 <cpaelzer> two autopkgtest issues left and 4 dependencies that don't yet build against -13 right

 15:33 <cpaelzer> doko: I think we can promote it, to see next week if there are any new mismatched

 15:33 <doko> ok

 15:33 <cpaelzer> which would help me to get them tackled soon'ish

 15:33 <cpaelzer> no onto new MIRs

 15:33 <doko> sarnold: can you give a timeline for the discount review?

 15:34 <cpaelzer> holding back new MIRs for sarnold to answer

 15:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: there are 5 new MIRs we need to handle - jamespage those are all openstack, are you intending to do the reivew on thise filed by Chris.MacNaughton ?

 15:35 <sarnold> doko: last I've heard, the google-osconfig-agent is the higher priority, and I've been handling tasks that were delayed for the previous release lately. I should return to doing MIRs this week, and the googly package gets first go

 15:36 <sarnold> doko: so probably next week (a short week for US holidays) or the week after, I think

 15:36 <doko> ok

 15:36 <cpaelzer> are there volunteers for the cases in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:36 <cpaelzer> I gues it will be ~1 each

 15:37 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yes I can pick those up

 15:37 <cpaelzer> unless james wanted to handle thos himself to keep a short round trip

 15:37 <cpaelzer> ah ok

 15:37 <cpaelzer> jamespage: if you end up going crazy let us know and we can share

 15:37 <jamespage> multiple conversations result in limited effectiveness

 15:37 <cpaelzer> I'll assign them to you now to reflect that

 15:37 <jamespage> but yep I can do those

 15:38 <cpaelzer> assigned

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:38 <cpaelzer> postgresql is under my control (see the discussion with doko a bit up in the log)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> but it will be with us a while until fully resolved

 15:39 <cpaelzer> no other very recent updates

 15:39 <cpaelzer> doko: anything on the lintian cases we/you need to do ?

 15:39 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lintian/+bug/1899213

 15:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1899213 in libtext-markdown-discount-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] new dependencies of lintian" [Undecided,In progress]

 15:39 <doko> no, just the security review

 15:40 <cpaelzer> do you have team news on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/raspberrypi-userland/+bug/1895137

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1895137 in rpi-eeprom (Ubuntu) "[MIR] rpi-eeprom; raspberrypi-userland" [Undecided,In progress]

 15:40 <cpaelzer> waveform: ^^ ?

 15:40 <cpaelzer> since the reivew of -userland there was no update anymore

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I wonder if this effort was aborted or just takes time?

 15:41 <doko> ok, I'll ask

 15:41 <cpaelzer> not super-important - mostyl I'm just curious what we should expect

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:41 <cpaelzer> nothing else from the server Team

 15:41 <cpaelzer> anyone ?

 15:42 <didrocks> nothing for me

 15:42 <sarnold> nothing new from me

 15:43 <cpaelzer> ok - MIR status loks good for the week then

 15:43 <cpaelzer> thank you everybody

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
