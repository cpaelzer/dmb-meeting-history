 14:02 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Mar 10 14:02:57 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:02 <meetingology> 

 14:02 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:03 <cpaelzer> hiho, here are doko jamespage and sarnold o/ we are missing didrocks and ddstreet atm

 14:03 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:03 <cpaelzer> Well, doko ddstreet and myself have met at the sprint

 14:03 <cpaelzer> I have an action item to restructure the wiki pages a bit

 14:03 <cpaelzer> and to add some of my templates for filing/reviewing there

 14:03 <cpaelzer> but I didn't get to it yet

 14:03 <cpaelzer> still an open action

 14:04 <didrocks> hey

 14:04 <cpaelzer> was there anything else open by you?

 14:04 <cpaelzer> actions I mean

 14:04 <didrocks> sorry, busy discussing on #u-desktop

 14:04 <cpaelzer> np didrocks, glad to have you here

 14:04 <didrocks> I have alsa-* that I will tackle tomorrow morning as a FYI

 14:04 <cpaelzer> ok no further actions it seems - lets check new and incomplete MIRs next then

 14:04 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:04 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:05 <cpaelzer> and

 14:05 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:05 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:05 <cpaelzer> jamespage: masakari is in there still?

 14:05 <cpaelzer> I thought that was ready to move

 14:06 <cpaelzer> jamespage: you fixed all that was asked for right?

 14:06 * cpaelzer is re-rading that case

 14:07 <jamespage> lemme check - I thought I had done - might just not have the right final status for promotion

 14:07 <cpaelzer> yep, but we have doko here who can do it right away

 14:07 <cpaelzer> jamespage: subscribed to masakari-monitors as well?

 14:08 <cpaelzer> oh I see there is a dependency from masakari

 14:08 <cpaelzer> jamespage: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:08 <cpaelzer> did you see python-sqlalchemy-utils and python-arrow

 14:09 <jamespage> hmm

 14:09 <jamespage> lemme dig into that the world must have moved since i raised the MIR

 14:09 <cpaelzer> python-arrow has an existign and ready to promote MIR bug

 14:09 <cpaelzer> from our old mailman3 efforts

 14:09 <cpaelzer> all you need to do there is subscribe the openstack Team

 14:10 <cpaelzer> but python-sqlalchemy-utils I have no idea yet

 14:10 <cpaelzer> jamespage: could you subscribe openstack to python-arrow then we can set all but the alchemy to the right state at least

 14:11 <jamespage> yep

 14:11 <cpaelzer> I updated the bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/masakari/+bug/1815991/comments/10

 14:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1815991 in masakari-monitors (Ubuntu) "[MIR] masakari and masakari-monitors" [Undecided,Fix committed]

 14:12 <jamespage> added ubuntu-openstack as subscriber for masakari-* and python-arrow

 14:12 <jamespage> sqla-utils looks needed

 14:12 <cpaelzer> and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-arrow/+bug/1820213/comments/3

 14:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1820213 in python-arrow (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-arrow as dependency of mailman3" [Undecided,Fix committed]

 14:13 <cpaelzer> ok, jamespage you will get back to us once you know what the python alchemy is really about then ok?

 14:13 <cpaelzer> moving on to the next in the list

 14:13 <jamespage> yes

 14:13 <cpaelzer> staying with the openstack Team for now

 14:13 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/neutron/+bug/1864667

 14:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864667 in neutron (Ubuntu) "[MIR] neutron-ovn-metadata-agent" [Undecided,New]

 14:13 <cpaelzer> netron is in main

 14:14 <cpaelzer> jamespage: you have to tach coreycb on MIR bugs a bit it seems :-)

 14:14 <cpaelzer> s/tach/teach

 14:14 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-octavia-lib/+bug/1864666 seems similar

 14:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864666 in python-octavia-lib (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-octavia-lib, ovn-octavia-provider" [Undecided,New]

 14:14 <cpaelzer> both need to change the bug tasks to be correctly spotted

 14:14 <jamespage> cpaelzer: binary only promotion

 14:14 <cpaelzer> are these 20.04 material or for >=20.10?

 14:15 <jamespage> ovn-metadata-agent I'd like to get for 20.04

 14:15 <cpaelzer> sry, can you explain what you mean by " binary only promotion" ?

 14:15 <jamespage> neutron-ovn-metadata-agent is

 14:15 <jamespage> as it comes from neutron right?

 14:16 <cpaelzer> it is only in proposed atm

 14:16 <cpaelzer> neutron-ovn-metadata-agent | 2:16.0.0~b2~git2020020712.d5b33ffc77-0ubuntu2 | focal-proposed | all

 14:17 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:17 <cpaelzer> Source: neutron

 14:17 <cpaelzer> there would be no need for a new MIR on this IMHO

 14:17 <cpaelzer> it will show up in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.html like it does in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html now

 14:18 <cpaelzer> jamespage: as it is listed as "Binary only movements to universe" is there no dependency holding it in?

 14:18 <cpaelzer> if so you'd need a seed change but no new MIR

 14:18 <cpaelzer> doko: if src packages in main build new binaries they usually go to main automatically right?

 14:18 <cpaelzer> and later get listed as "Binary only movements to universe" if there is no dep holding them in

 14:18 <jamespage> cpaelzer: no I think it still needs seeding for that

 14:19 <cpaelzer> that might be true

 14:19 <jamespage> I'll get that sorted

 14:19 <cpaelzer> but you can kill the MIR bug

 14:19 <doko> cpaelzer: no, manually, but they don't require a MIR

 14:19 <cpaelzer> is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-octavia-lib/+bug/1864666 the same case?

 14:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1864666 in python-octavia-lib (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-octavia-lib, ovn-octavia-provider" [Undecided,New]

 14:19 <cpaelzer> no that is a new source in universe

 14:20 <cpaelzer> ovn-octavia-provider | 0.0.1~git2020022414.000049c-0ubuntu1 | focal/universe | source

 14:20 <cpaelzer> python-octavia-lib | 1.5.0-0ubuntu1 | focal/universe | source

 14:20 <cpaelzer> as well

 14:20 <cpaelzer> I added the bug task

 14:21 <cpaelzer> jamespage: will you review those to keep the loop with corey on needed fixes close?

 14:21 <jamespage> yes

 14:21 <cpaelzer> ok assigned

 14:21 <jamespage> I've pushed the seed change for neutron-ovn-metadata-agent but its stuck in proposed atm

 14:22 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:22 <cpaelzer> is python-octavia-lib, ovn-octavia-provider at least >=20.10 then?

 14:22 <cpaelzer> security Team will explode due to review pressure :-)

 14:22 <cpaelzer> ok I thnik we are good on this one

 14:23 <cpaelzer> next and last in the list is

 14:23 <didrocks> that hasn’t happened yet? :)

 14:23 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-ucm-conf/+bug/1862776

 14:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1862776 in alsa-ucm-conf (Ubuntu) "[MIR] alsa-ucm-conf & alsa-topology-conf (b-d of alsa-lib)" [High,New]

 14:23 <didrocks> that’s the alsa things I will do tomorrow morning

 14:23 <cpaelzer> filed by doko as it shows up https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:23 <cpaelzer> didrocks: will you do a MIR review or will this go another path to resolve?

 14:23 <didrocks> cpaelzer: MIR review and fix if necessary

 14:24 <didrocks> if all ok, just promote to unblock proposed

 14:24 <cpaelzer> if you expect to need security review let them know early

 14:24 <cpaelzer> I have assigned you on the bug for now

 14:24 <cpaelzer> thanks didrocks

 14:24 <didrocks> yw

 14:24 <cpaelzer> wow a lot of new things, lets check the incomplete list for new entries

 14:24 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:24 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:25 <cpaelzer> the only one updated since we spoke the last time is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-instance-connect/+bug/1835114

 14:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1835114 in ec2-instance-connect (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ec2-instance-connect" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:25 <cpaelzer> things are going on between rbalint and sarnold

 14:25 <cpaelzer> sarnold:  in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-instance-connect/+bug/1835114/comments/29 you acked for security right

 14:26 <sarnold> cpaelzer: yes

 14:26 <cpaelzer> hmm, so they got you and by that the security ack

 14:27 <cpaelzer> it still is one of the cases that every engineer looking at raises more eyebrows than he should have

 14:27 <cpaelzer> is anyone willing and has the time to re-check this from the MIR POV?

 14:28 <cpaelzer> I've opened quite some "please fix" in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-instance-connect/+bug/1835114/comments/5

 14:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1835114 in ec2-instance-connect (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ec2-instance-connect" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:28 <cpaelzer> but a lot of things changed

 14:28 <cpaelzer> and it might be time to have a fresh look at it

 14:28 <cpaelzer> so I'd appreciate if it would not be me

 14:28 <cpaelzer> as I'm infected by my past on this

 14:28 <cpaelzer> doko: do you think you could do that

 14:29 <cpaelzer> you are closest to rbalint (team wise) to make him pay if things are not right ...

 14:31 <cpaelzer> we lost doko :-/

 14:32 <cpaelzer> anyone else up to re-review this?

 14:32 <doko> sorry

 14:33 <doko> cpaelzer: 1835114?

 14:33 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:33 <doko> I can do that

 14:33 <cpaelzer> thank you a lot

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I'll be assigning you

 14:33 <cpaelzer> ok last entry on the agenda

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I guess we all got and siad engouh today :-)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> missing ddstreet is the only topic for me :-/

 14:34 <cpaelzer> next time then ...

 14:34 <cpaelzer> ok I'll close in 10 then

 14:34 <rbalint> cpaelzer, sarnold  acked the mir

 14:34 <cpaelzer> he acked the security review

 14:35 <rbalint> cpaelzer, yes

 14:35 <cpaelzer> the MIR Teams ack was still open

 14:35 <cpaelzer> as I said above this needs a fresh view and doko was so kind to agree to re-look at it

 14:35 <cpaelzer> if all the fixes and discussions that I saw flying by really resolved it you'll get that ack as well soon and can go on

 14:35 <cpaelzer> otherwise doko will let you know

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok closing for today then ...

 14:36 <rbalint> cpaelzer, thanks, i tried to address rharper's commets and i'm waiting for feedback from him and from cpc to commit to implement tests in some form

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok good to know thanks rbalint

 14:37 <cpaelzer> rbalint: if you happen to have the chance to summarize the "still open parts" of it on the bug that would be helpful to everyone

 14:37 <doko> thanks, and bye

 14:37 <cpaelzer> cu
