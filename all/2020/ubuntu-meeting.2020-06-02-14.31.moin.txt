 14:31 <meetingology> cpaelzer: Error: Can't start another meeting, one is in progress.

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:31 <cpaelzer> I wanted to look at the false-positives in component mismatches

 14:32 <cpaelzer> but someone beat me to it

 14:32 <sarnold> hmm, the old meeting is still going..

 14:32 <cpaelzer> so it is done without me doing anything

 14:32 <sarnold> ooh never min dme

 14:32 <cpaelzer> :-)

 14:32 <cpaelzer> you fell into my copy&paste error trap sarnold :-)

 14:32 <cpaelzer> no other actions left

 14:32 <sarnold> indeed :)

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <didrocks> nice graph on supported-desktop-extra :)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> IIRC didrocks said appstream is on him, was that correct?

 14:33 <sarnold> node-jdquery self-cycle? that's curious..

 14:33 <didrocks> weird that appstream is still there, I demoted -doc, Iâ€™ll check again

 14:33 <didrocks> cpaelzer: yeah, I thought that was handled but it seems it needs a little bit more, will do it

 14:34 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I'd leave that to itslef for now (node-jd)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> thanks didrocks for looking again after it

 14:34 <cpaelzer> the rest is mostly known and not worth a look

 14:34 <cpaelzer> the one thing I fail to remember is, have we talked about "kazoo"

 14:35 <cpaelzer> oh yeah that was openstack related and on jamespage

 14:35 <cpaelzer> ok nothing left here to assign

 14:35 <doko> I'm handling the new lintian deps

 14:35 <cpaelzer> let us move on

 14:35 <cpaelzer> thanks doko!

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <cpaelzer> two in here

 14:36 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-secretstorage/+bug/1861268 which is already in progress

 14:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1861268 in jeepney (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jeepney" [Medium,New]

 14:36 <cpaelzer> just affetcs more packages now

 14:36 <cpaelzer> really new is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openscap/+bug/1877696

 14:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1877696 in openscap (Ubuntu) "[MIR] openscap" [Undecided,New]

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I can do a MIR review on it tomorrow if that is ok

 14:36 <cpaelzer> We can skip incomplete bugs, there was no change in that list

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> as usual in this part of the cycle it was ncie and fast

 14:37 <cpaelzer> anything else worth to bring up

 14:37 <cpaelzer> maybe sarnold want to talk about the special bit in openscap?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> which is promoting it in old releases as well

 14:38 <cpaelzer> doko: ^^ in case this happened prior, let us know how it was handled

 14:38 <sarnold> cpaelzer: it is indeed a bit special, and perhaps still under discussion, we're using this for compliance against benchmarks and cvescan; the cvescan use is being replaced with something NIH, but the compliance use we're going to keep..

 14:39 <sarnold> and I'm not entirely sure if we'd rather keep using as-packaged version for our older releases or if we'd like to snap the thing, or live with status quo for old releases where it's used but not in main

 14:39 <doko> please make sure that it at least builds ...

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I'm not opposed to it, I'll check the dependencies throughout all releases on the review

 14:39 <sarnold> good idea, it's not fun to find out FTBFS when doing a security update

 14:39 <cpaelzer> from there we will see sarnold is that ok for you ?

 14:39 <sarnold> yes

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok then

 14:39 <doko> we cannot promote it in the release pocket, only in updates, so it requires a new upload

 14:39 <cpaelzer> that was the "other topics" topic

 14:39 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> let's count out with reverse fibonacci then for today

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 8

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 5

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 3

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 2

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 1

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 1

 14:40 <cpaelzer> 0

 14:40 <cpaelzer> nothing, cu next week

 14:40 <sarnold> :)

 14:40 <sarnold> thanks

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
