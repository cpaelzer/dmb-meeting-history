 16:08 <mclemenceau> we'll go to hirsute next

 16:08 <rbalint> tdaitx, is jckd

 16:08 <mclemenceau> \o/ no bug in gg

 16:08 <mclemenceau> #topic Release incoming bugs (hirsute)

 16:09 <mclemenceau> looks like a ftbfs according to doko

 16:09 <rbalint> i guess we need to take that for openstack

 16:10 <mclemenceau> ok, I'll card this

 16:11 <mclemenceau> it appears it is resolved

 16:11 <doko> I think that's fixed by a dnspython upload

 16:11 <mclemenceau> bug 1907850

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1907850 in apt (Ubuntu) "Cache not generated for all translations" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1907850

 16:12 <mclemenceau> Looks like julian is already planning to SRU this, probably something to card

 16:13 <mclemenceau> next bug 1907956

 16:13 <ubottu> bug 1907956 in whoopsie (Ubuntu) "ubiquity crash on whoopsie removal, Xubuntu 21.04 minimal install" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1907956

 16:14 <mclemenceau> let's card this one.

 16:15 <mclemenceau> done with hirsute

 16:15 <mclemenceau> let's look at focal now

 16:15 <mclemenceau> #topic Release incoming bugs (focal)

 16:16 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:16 <mclemenceau> bug 1906551 has been carded already

 16:16 <ubottu> bug 1906551 in u-boot (Ubuntu) "uc20 armhf image does not boot on rpi4-8GB" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1906551

 16:16 <mclemenceau> waveform: you've made good progress on this one this week

 16:17 <mclemenceau> and bug 1898026

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1898026 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "interruption of dist-upgrade can leave you next release in sources.list" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1898026

 16:17 <waveform> 1906551 is effectively a duplicate of https://launchpad.net/bugs/1906552

 16:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1906552 in u-boot (Ubuntu Focal) ""Synchronous Abort" handler and reboot loop on rpi" [Undecided,New]

 16:18 <mclemenceau> we talked about this one last week I believe

 16:22 <mclemenceau> ok let's leave it in here for now. Sounds like a low priority, potential Wish list

 16:22 <mclemenceau> let's look at proposed migration

 16:23 <mclemenceau> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:23 <mclemenceau> So without vorlon and with only a few days left, probably don't need to go through the entire list

 16:23 <mclemenceau> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:24 <mclemenceau> autoipkgtest are pretty full at the moment

 16:24 <mclemenceau> queues

 16:34 <rbalint> devpatch is still on my plate

 16:36 <mclemenceau> with only one day before the holiday, and current workload, probably not meaningful to add more to our plates..

 16:40 <mclemenceau> probably enough for today, that was longer than I thought the meeting would be :-)

 16:40 <mclemenceau> #topic AOB

 16:41 <mclemenceau> happy holidays everyone üéÑ!

 16:42 <rbalint> happy holidays! \o/

 16:42 <mclemenceau> üç∑
