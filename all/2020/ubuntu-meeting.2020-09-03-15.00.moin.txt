 15:08 * xnox should be EOW, it's my birthday with half day off.... Very short week due to Plumbers last week, and only 2.5 days this week. Mostly focused on landing grub changes in all the places.

 15:08 <bdmurray> Happy Birthday xnox

 15:09 <sil2100> Happy birthday indeed o/

 15:09 <waveform> happy birthday xnox!

 15:09 <tdaitx> xnox: and birthday =D

 15:09 <bdmurray> If it were my birthday I'd take the whole day off

 15:09 <doko> happy singing in the hangout, but you're not there ;p

 15:10 <juliank> PARTAY

 15:10 <bdmurray> okay, back to our regularly scheduled program

 15:10 <bdmurray> rbalint I tested bug 1891952 and it is not fixed afaict

 15:10 <ubottu> bug 1891952 in friendly-recovery (Ubuntu Groovy) "systemd-resolved not started when networking enabled" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1891952

 15:11 <rbalint> bdmurray, yes, i'm uploading new systemd point release then test that

 15:11 <bdmurray> rbalint: okay, will do

 15:11 <bdmurray> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:11 <rbalint> (please)

 15:11 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-gg-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:12 <bdmurray> bug 1893899 just needs sponsoring

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1893899 in OEM Priority Project "update alsa/audio realted infomation collection code in apport" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1893899

 15:12 <bdmurray> so lets take that

 15:12 <bdmurray> bug 1876258

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1876258 in MAAS 2.8 "ubuntu 20.04 pxe installation fails with no such file or directory /dev/disk/by-id exception" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1876258

 15:14 <bdmurray> Why is there a grub2 task here?

 15:14 <bdmurray> juliank: ?

 15:14 <juliank> oh tricky

 15:14 <juliank> grub-pc required by-id disks, but grub-efi did not, but now does in focal+

 15:15 <juliank> and some places don't have by-disk

 15:15 <juliank> um

 15:15 <juliank> by-id

 15:15 <juliank> Wondering if grub should handle such cases or not

 15:16 <tdaitx> last comment points to a commit with a fix for it

 15:16 <juliank> possibly grub works, and it's just a curtin bug?

 15:16 <tdaitx> seems like it

 15:17 <vorlon> mark invalid, and wait to see if anyone complains?

 15:17 <juliank> Yup we have # Fall back to the plain device name if there's no by-id link for it.

 15:17 <juliank> I'll mark as invalid

 15:17 <bdmurray> Okay, thanks.

 15:17 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:18 <bdmurray> and there's nothing here for us

 15:18 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:19 <rbalint> google, gce need new mirs

 15:19 <vorlon> [LINK] https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:19 <rbalint> also security review

 15:19 <vorlon> rbalint: are you driving those MIRs?

 15:20 <rbalint> vorlon, yes

 15:20 <vorlon> ok

 15:20 <rbalint> also i would accept help with the golang build deps :-)

 15:20 <vorlon> sil2100: did you need to hand dnspython off to someone else who has ipv6?

 15:21 <sil2100> vorlon: I think I'll do that, yes

 15:21 <vorlon> ok, someone want to volunteer for dnspython?

 15:21 <rbalint> juliank, has gigabits of ipv6 :-)

 15:21 <slyon> i can

 15:21 <vorlon> slyon: thanks

 15:21 <sil2100> I didn't try again this week but I guess I lost already too much time trying to get that reproduced

 15:22 <vorlon> tdaitx: any progress on libgitlab-api-v4-perl?

 15:22 <sil2100> slyon: I filled in an excuses bug LP: #1892832

 15:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1892832 in dnspython (Ubuntu) "dnspython 2.0.0-1 fails IPv6 autopkgtests" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1892832

 15:22 <slyon> sil2100: thanks, I saw that

 15:22 <sil2100> It has the context and a debdiff for disabling the IPv6 UDP-ish tests in case it's really just flaky on the infra

 15:22 <sil2100> Thanks!

 15:22 <vorlon> tdaitx: (seems to need a newer bash-completion?)

 15:23 <tdaitx> vorlon: yeah, I uploaded bash-completion to fix libgitlab-api-v4-perl

 15:23 <vorlon> ah, then it needs a manual retry since lp doesn't detect virtual packages for depwait

 15:23 <vorlon> (done)

 15:23 <vorlon> setuptools is still xnox, so we'll skip

 15:24 <vorlon> libffi is in progress, just waiting for ghc/armhf to finish building (now that it's not failing out every 12 hours)

 15:24 <tdaitx> bash-completion is stuck with a failed amrhf autopkgtest from cyrus-imapd (crappy reverse deps from cyrus)

 15:24 <vorlon> openjdk-lts vs alsa: tdaitx is this something you can look at?

 15:24 <tdaitx> yes, I can

 15:24 <vorlon> thanks

 15:24 <vorlon> pango1.0 + glib2.0: bdmurray?

 15:25 <bdmurray> vorlon: okay

 15:25 <vorlon> lintian: new version, but same problems as before. juliank?

 15:25 <juliank> Forwarded lintian one to upstream

 15:26 <juliank> I kind of forgot about it, and only did that today, so no response yet :)

 15:26 <vorlon> util-linux, I can have a look at

 15:26 <vorlon> and gcc-10 is still building, so nothing special to do there (and it's doko's anyway)

 15:26 <vorlon> and that's the list for today

 15:27 <bdmurray> nice

 15:27 <doko> well, it's the second or third attempt again

 15:27 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:27 <bdmurray> Monday is a US holiday, but I'll be working that day

 15:28 <sil2100> I'm taking holidays for the next 2 weeks o/

 15:28 <rbalint> sil2100, o/ :-)

 15:28 <sil2100> But I'll be lurking around

 15:28 <rbalint> i'd like to get https://code.launchpad.net/~rbalint/britney/hints-ubuntu-bzr-to-git/+merge/386139 moving

 15:32 <bdmurray> alright if there is nothing else

 15:32 <vorlon> Monday is a bank holiday for the US
