 12:04 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 12:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 12:04 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 12:04 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 12:04 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:05 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:05 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:05 <Wild_Man> #topic franksmcb

 12:06 <Wild_Man> franksmcb, please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 12:06 <franksmcb> Hi all, I'm Bill. I'm a sysadmin turned project manager. I've been using linux and ubuntu for several years and am a member of the Ubuntu MATE team. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/franksmcb

 12:19 <Wild_Man> Welcome ejat

 12:19 <ejat> thanks

 12:19 <ejat> sorr out of irc for a while

 12:19 <Wild_Man> Does anyone have any questions for franksmcb ?

 12:20 <ejat> so far nope ..

 12:20 <diddledan> I'm good

 12:20 <Wild_Man> Let's vote then

 12:20 <diddledan> \o/

 12:21 <meetingology> Warning: Nick not in channel: myfenris

 12:21 <meetingology> Current voters: Wild_Man bashfulrobot diddledan myfenris wxl

 12:21 <ejat> +1

 12:21 <Wild_Man> +1

 12:21 <diddledan> +1

 12:21 <diddledan> oh, forgot to start the #vote

 12:22 <Wild_Man> I sure did, thanks

 12:22 <Wild_Man> #vote

 12:22 <meetingology> Please vote on:

 12:22 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1/-1/+0 #channelname)

 12:22 <diddledan> +1

 12:22 <Wild_Man> +1

 12:22 <ejat> +1

 12:22 <diddledan> maybe #voters needs to be second?

 12:23 <Wild_Man> I am voting the proxies for bashfulrobot and wxl both are +1

 12:23 <diddledan> the bot didn't spot the votes, which I think means it doesn't know who should be voting - I think the order of #vote and #voters is important

 12:24 <Wild_Man> Looking

 12:25 <Wild_Man> I will try one more time I have not chaired in a while

 12:25 <Wild_Man> #voters Wild_Man diddledan myfenris bashfulrobot wxl

 12:25 <meetingology> Current voters: Wild_Man bashfulrobot diddledan myfenris wxl

 12:25 <diddledan> is all good :-)

 12:25 <diddledan> +1

 12:25 <diddledan> maybe the bot is busted

 12:26 <Wild_Man> Not sure how to cast there votes

 12:26 <Wild_Man> bashfulrobot, +1

 12:26 <Wild_Man> wxl +1

 12:26 <diddledan> there's no easy way to get the bot to recognise proxy votes :-(

 12:26 <Wild_Man> That will have to do

 12:26 <diddledan> you have to just do it outside the normal flow
