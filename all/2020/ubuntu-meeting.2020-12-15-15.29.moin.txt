 15:29 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:29 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Dec 15 15:29:33 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:29 <meetingology> 

 15:29 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:29 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: didrocks: sarnold: doko: jamespage: - ping

 15:30 <cpaelzer> not sure who might be already out for EOY :-)

 15:30 <cpaelzer> at least didrocks isn't on the channel anymore

 15:30 <cpaelzer> giving everone a minute to see the ping

 15:32 <cpaelzer> ok let us get this started

 15:32 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: you might be the only one around :-)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> gladly most lists look rather idle

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:32 <ddstreet> me and you! :) and this is my last day, off starting tomorrow :)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> the logs will carry on

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I had the action to work out what happens with needrestart

 15:33 <cpaelzer> that is indeed on foundations, but not yet

 15:33 <cpaelzer> we created a stub MIR request

 15:33 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/needrestart/+bug/1907422

 15:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1907422 in needrestart (Ubuntu) "[MIR] needrestart + dependencies" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 15:33 <cpaelzer> in that state it will hang until they are really ready to work on it

 15:33 <cpaelzer> good side: no more undefined

 15:33 <sarnold> good morning

 15:33 <cpaelzer> hey sarnold

 15:33 <cpaelzer> three is a crowd

 15:34 <cpaelzer> no further old actions

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:34 <cpaelzer> this one only has old cases

 15:34 <cpaelzer> opensbi is on security now

 15:34 <cpaelzer> rpi things are on waveform and we updated the bug to be clear on that

 15:34 <cpaelzer> and needrestart I just mentioned

 15:34 <cpaelzer> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:35 <cpaelzer> this one has a bit more action

 15:35 <sarnold> heh, both checkrestart and needrestart need perl

 15:35 <cpaelzer> in the proposed mismatches are

 15:35 <cpaelzer> a) a few perl mismatches usually done by foundation/doko

 15:36 <cpaelzer> b) a few things for the openstack team sqlalchemy -> psycopg2cffi / python-infinity

 15:36 <cpaelzer> c) neutron-vpnaas -> pyflakes (also openstack)

 15:36 <cpaelzer> (a) isn't urgent and can wait until people are back in 2021

 15:37 <cpaelzer> (b)+(c) are for jamespage and coreycb - also not urgent and eventually work items for them in early 2021

 15:37 <cpaelzer> hmm

 15:37 <cpaelzer> one more

 15:37 <cpaelzer> d) tiff -> libdeflate

 15:37 <cpaelzer> I haven't looked into that ...

 15:38 <cpaelzer> runtime dependency by building against libdeflate-dev

 15:39 <cpaelzer> tiff is Desktop and then probably for didrocks once he is back

 15:39 <cpaelzer> anything else one of you want to discuss?

 15:40 <cpaelzer> (in the component mismatches)

 15:40 <ddstreet> nothing from me

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:40 <cpaelzer> List is empty

 15:40 <cpaelzer> opensbi went in this week and I reviewed it

 15:40 <cpaelzer> it is now on security to review

 15:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/opensbi/+bug/1906668

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1906668 in opensbi (Ubuntu) "[MIR] opensbi" [Undecided,New]

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:41 <cpaelzer> only recent activity is on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/raspberrypi-userland/+bug/1895137

 15:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1895137 in rpi-eeprom (Ubuntu) "[MIR] rpi-eeprom; raspberrypi-userland" [Undecided,In progress]

 15:41 <cpaelzer> that is the mentioned update after last weeks meeting

 15:41 <cpaelzer> nothing to do here for now

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I have to ask about the security reviews

 15:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold: from my POV the queue didn't move at all for quite a while

 15:41 <sarnold> cpaelzer: doko's concerns have been shared with management, who assure me they are keenly aware of our problems

 15:42 <cpaelzer> sarnold: is there any ETA on progress in 2021 or is it all still panic?

 15:42 <cpaelzer> sarnold: oh he expressed the same then?

 15:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I do hope for progress in next year, yes, but I can't imagine we'll be able to get through as many packages as we did

 15:42 <cpaelzer> I'm fine then, thanks for clarifying

 15:43 <cpaelzer> IMHO the list (that is ordered) should get cards for Months so that everone has a soft ETA

 15:43 <cpaelzer> but before we improve the process you need to get manpower to do it :-/

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I think we are done on this

 15:43 <cpaelzer> any other topic to bring up?

 15:44 <sarnold> there's only a few more working days in the year for me :) I intend to be asleep at this time next week

 15:44 <cpaelzer> hehe

 15:44 <cpaelzer> only fair

 15:44 <cpaelzer> Thank you all for your MIR participation!

 15:45 <cpaelzer> and enjoy the EOY Downtime to relax

 15:45 <sarnold> so if there are more mir team meetings in the rest of the year, please accept my apologies for missing them

 15:45 <cpaelzer> there won't be any

 15:45 <sarnold> hooray

 15:45 <cpaelzer> I'll see if I can cancel the calendar enties

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
