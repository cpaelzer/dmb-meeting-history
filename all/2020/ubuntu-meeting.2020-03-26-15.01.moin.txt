 15:08 <ubottu> bug 1867065 in casper (Ubuntu) "Installer hangs at boot on machine" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1867065

 15:09 <bdmurray> this is related to the spinner theme stuff

 15:09 <bdmurray> so lets move on

 15:10 <bdmurray> bug 1868191

 15:10 <ubottu> bug 1868191 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Unchecking all optional media apps, install fails" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868191

 15:10 <xnox> there has been some progres; but more casper work is needed

 15:11 <bdmurray> This one seems to be a dupe of bug 1851346 so next

 15:11 <ubottu> bug 1851346 in ubuntustudio-live (Ubuntu Focal) "Ubuntu Studio 19.10 Installer Causes Wanted Programs to be Removed" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1851346

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1868716 in git (Ubuntu) "git: fatal: mmap failed: Cannot allocate memory" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868716

 15:13 <bdmurray> doko: you think we should be fixing this for Focal

 15:14 <doko> bdmurray: would be nice to have a working git?

 15:15 <bdmurray> Okay, lets target and card that then.

 15:15 <bdmurray> And lets all keep an eye out for issues with git

 15:16 <xnox> possibly a support issue

 15:16 <bdmurray> bug 1868240 - it looks like seb is investigating

 15:16 <ubottu> bug 1868240 in plymouth (Ubuntu) "No plymouth screens displayed at all after installing the Nvidia driver" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868240

 15:17 <bdmurray> bug 1868409

 15:17 <ubottu> bug 1868409 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "gnome-{calculator,logs,characters} snaps not removed after the equivalent APT packages are installed on 20.04, and gnome-software APT package not replaced by snap-store" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868409

 15:17 <bdmurray> I'm just gonna comment on that, I believe update-manager is supposed to sort this out

 15:20 <bdmurray> rls-ee and rls-bb are fine

 15:20 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:21 <bdmurray> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <bdmurray> is openssh still with security?

 15:23 <bdmurray> doko: ^^

 15:23 <doko> bdmurray: yes

 15:23 <xnox> mercurial -> i propose to reduce the autopkgtest to basic usage only

 15:23 <bdmurray> netplan.io I thought I just read the tests were fixed

 15:24 <xnox> yes

 15:24 <xnox> but the test retriggers didn't happen (or got lost)

 15:24 <slyon> netplan is fixed in 0.98-0ubuntu4

 15:24 <xnox> i retriggered again today, there should be results in a few hours

 15:24 <bdmurray> okay

 15:24 <xnox> if not something odd is happening

 15:24 <bdmurray> python3-defaults - kazoo

 15:25 <bdmurray> the failure on arm64 looks the same as the amd64 failure which retrying fixed

 15:25 <bdmurray> however retrying arm64 didn't help...

 15:26 <bdmurray> So if somebody could help me look at it that would be nice

 15:26 <bdmurray> xnox: did you look at python-fabio?

 15:28 <xnox> yes, and gave up

 15:28 <xnox> i don't understand it =(

 15:29 <bdmurray> maybe mwhudson can sort it out

 15:29 <bdmurray> what about scipy?

 15:29 <bdmurray> It didn't show up last week iirc

 15:32 <bdmurray> rbalint: can you look at beets?

 15:32 <rbalint> bdmurray, sure, taking it

 15:32 <bdmurray> xnox will take gnutls28

 15:32 <waveform> I'll take mu-editor

 15:32 <bdmurray> thanks

 15:33 <bdmurray> I'll look at django-axes

 15:33 <bdmurray> tdaitx: can you look at dune-common?

 15:33 <tdaitx> bdmurray: will do

 15:33 <doko> I'll look at beets

 15:33 <bdmurray> slyon: Do you time to look at anything?

 15:34 <slyon> I'm mostly busy with NetworkManager currently

 15:34 <bdmurray> okay

 15:34 <bdmurray> juliank: python-llfuse?

 15:35 <juliank> ok

 15:35 <bdmurray> I guess we need to loop around

 15:35 <bdmurray> python-nacl - doko?

 15:36 <bdmurray> scipy we'll leave for vorlon or mwhudson

 15:37 <bdmurray> lapack - anybody?

 15:37 <xnox> i'll take it

 15:37 <bdmurray> pcre3 ... php-mockery we'll ask server

 15:38 <bdmurray> uchardet - rbalint?

 15:38 <rbalint> bdmurray, ok

 15:38 <bdmurray> pinentry I'll have a look

 15:38 <bdmurray> dpkg - julianâ€½

 15:39 <juliank> mhh

 15:40 <xnox> sil2100:  lapack is no longer built on i386, so it should be badtested on i386, and then badtest removed, britney "missfired" i386 request

 15:40 <juliank> that seems a bit excessive

 15:40 <bdmurray> I'm sorry could you elaborate?

 15:41 <juliank> well, there are no related failures afaict, and they're spread across a lot of ecosystems

 15:42 <xnox> bdmurray:  i'll take dpkg to drive to resetting

 15:42 <bdmurray> xnox okay, thanks!

 15:42 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:43 <bdmurray> Next week is Beta!

 15:43 <doko> yes, autopkg images

 15:43 <juliank> I'm off tomorrow

 15:43 <juliank> should we revert shim nowÃŸ

 15:43 <juliank> ?

 15:43 <doko> juliank: any progress with the update, or is it waiting on the kernel?

 15:43 <juliank> doko: well, i have not looked

 15:45 <bdmurray> how can we decide about shim?

 15:45 <juliank> shim is breaking fwupd (or well, any argument passed to it)

 15:46 <waveform> anybody that has a bit of time and a spare pi or three - feel free to test out pibootctl from ppa:waveform/pibootctl - now with (incomplete) bash completion :)

 15:47 <bdmurray> julian will look in the age of focal autopkg images

 15:50 <bdmurray> okay, lets wrap this up

 15:50 <bdmurray> 1
