 16:00 <jawn-smith> #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team

 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started at 16:00:22 UTC.  The chair is jawn-smith.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:00 <ginggs> o/

 16:00 <bdrung> \o

 16:00 <jawn-smith> The weekly status is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-26-january-2023/33463

 16:00 <jawn-smith> Let's all read and ask questions

 16:02 <mclemenceau> o/

 16:03 <jawn-smith> waveform: have you looked into lsb being stuck in proposed at all?

 16:03 <waveform> looked at proposed-migration but couldn't see it there

 16:03 <waveform> but I haven't look in depth yet

 16:04 <jawn-smith> hmm

 16:04 <schopin> I don't find lsb in the global excuses page.

 16:04 <jawn-smith> I got an email that it was stuck

 16:04 <jawn-smith> but now I see it in release

 16:04 <waveform> yeah, so did I -- and about lsb-release-minimal too but by the time I looked I couldn't see it there

 16:04 <vorlon> yeah sysvinit migrated, so lsb had to have migrated first/in parallel

 16:05 <bdmurray> Are we talking about status or migration?

 16:06 <vorlon> USCIS

 16:08 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:08 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:08 <jawn-smith> bug 2003331

 16:09 <jawn-smith> Was discussed last week, let's see what we said

 16:09 <bdmurray> The desktop team will look at it

 16:09 <jawn-smith> Excellent, moving on

 16:09 <jawn-smith> bug 2002871

 16:12 <jawn-smith> waveform has volunteered to look into this

 16:12 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 16:12 <jawn-smith> bug 1827442

 16:13 <vorlon> oh, why is this here

 16:13 <slyon> vorlon: identiefied (and dropped) libheif as a new libgd2 dependency

 16:13 <slyon> basically foundations needs to decide if we want to take ownership of libheif, dav1d, aom, libde265, x265

 16:13 <vorlon> this can go to me but I thought it was off critical path because I added a libgd2 delta

 16:13 <slyon> and do MIRs for dav1d, aom, libde265, x265

 16:14 <slyon> vorlon: right, it's not on the ciritical path. just wanted to hand out a bunch of MIRs

 16:15 <jawn-smith> Let's assign this to vpa1977

 16:15 <jawn-smith> Okay that's all for ll

 16:15 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:16 <jawn-smith> bug 1842439

 16:16 <vorlon> we synced with the Desktop Team, they agree it's a gtk bug it just hasn't proved fixable yet

 16:16 <jawn-smith> So nothing for us to do then

 16:16 <vorlon> so we should mark it invalid for apport and triaged for gtk

 16:17 <bdmurray> we will target it to lunar and remove the -incoming tag

 16:17 <jawn-smith> Great thanks bdmurray

 16:17 <jawn-smith> bug 2003014

 16:18 <bdrung> once gtk thrown an error instead of crashing, apport needs to catch and handle it.

 16:21 <bdmurray> This is something Foundations should do for Ubuntu Unity so let's move it to foundations-todo

 16:21 <jawn-smith> Great thanks bdmurray

 16:21 <jawn-smith> That's it for kk

 16:21 <bdmurray> I'll target it to the series etc

 16:21 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:22 <jawn-smith> bug 1999345

 16:22 <jawn-smith> juliank_: anything new with this one?

 16:22 <jawn-smith> Still with security?

 16:22 <juliank_> no

 16:22 <juliank_> yes

 16:22 <jawn-smith> Okay that's it for bugs then

 16:22 <jawn-smith> #topic proposed-migration

 16:22 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:22 <jawn-smith> vorlon:

 16:23 <vorlon> I saw there was discussion in last week's meeting about debuerreotype vs debootstrap, which had been assigned to jawn-smith 2 weeks ago

 16:24 <jawn-smith> I volunteered for it but it ended up being assigned to waveform instead

 16:24 <vorlon> ah ok

 16:24 <jawn-smith> He has investigated removing debuerreotype

 16:24 <waveform> that's pending removal -- I can keep an eye on it but am otherwise free

 16:24 <jawn-smith> and filed bug 2003963

 16:25 <vorlon> 'pending removal' - disingenuous, you filed the bug 25 minutes ago ;P

 16:25 <vorlon> got it

 16:25 <vorlon> ubottu not helpful

 16:25 <waveform> heh

 16:26 <vorlon> python3-defaults: I think we might want to divide this stuff up

 16:27 <vorlon> now that we're getting down to the hard ones

 16:27 <vorlon> ceph is with the openstack team

 16:27 <vorlon> ginggs is working on dipy

 16:27 <vorlon> python-xmlrunner was fixed in Debian and should just need a retry

 16:28 <vorlon> paride was looking at breezy last week on +1 maintenance, and bryce mentioned it this week on his +1 but I'm not sure if that's still with either of them

 16:28 <vorlon> fastapi: jawn-smith has retriggered

 16:28 <vorlon> so let's see

 16:28 <vorlon> conda-package-streaming: adrien can you take this?

 16:28 <ginggs> breezy acutally migrated an hour ago

 16:28 <vorlon> metalfinder: bdrung?

 16:28 <vorlon> ginggs: oh excellent

 16:29 <vorlon> nipype: bdmurray?

 16:29 <bdrung> okay

 16:29 <ginggs> and pytorch should be removed

 16:29 <schopin> bdrung: metalfinder might just need a retry

 16:30 <vorlon> openstack-trove: dbungert? (but this might turn out to be ceph related in which case you can punt to the openstack team)

 16:30 <dbungert> vorlon: ack

 16:30 <bdmurray> ack

 16:30 <vorlon> python-django-tagging: danilogondolfo?

 16:30 <danilogondolfo> sure

 16:30 <vorlon> python-hypothesis: waveform?

 16:30 <waveform> ok

 16:30 <vorlon> python-morris: ginggs?

 16:30 <ginggs> sure

 16:30 <vorlon> q2cli: xypron?

 16:30 <xypron> vorlon: ok

 16:31 <vorlon> ubiquity is a bigger one, we're the upstream for it; any volunteers?

 16:31 <vorlon> and then I need to hand the rest of this off to someone else because I have a conflicting meeting, sorry - jawn-smith ?

 16:31 <jawn-smith> o/

 16:31 <adrien> I can take conda-package-streaming

 16:32 <ogayot> I can pick ubiquity

 16:32 <bdrung> if no-one else wants to take ubiquity, I can take it.

 16:32 <jawn-smith> Thanks ogayot

 16:32 <jawn-smith> python-distutils-extra vs setuptools

 16:33 <jawn-smith> any volunteers?

 16:33 <schopin> o/

 16:33 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 16:33 <jawn-smith> This reprepro vs libarchive looks strange

 16:33 <jawn-smith> I'll take that

 16:34 <jawn-smith> pygments has a handful of regressions, anyone keen on working those?

 16:34 <slyon> o/

 16:34 <jawn-smith> Thanks slyon

 16:34 <bdrung> reprepro: "zstd: /*stdout*\: Broken pipe"

 16:34 <jawn-smith> llvm-toolchain-14

 16:35 <jawn-smith> doko: can you take llvm-toolchain-14?

 16:36 <jawn-smith> hyphy vs curl, any takers?

 16:36 <bdrung> interesting. curl failed with "Illegal instruction (core dumped)"

 16:36 <schopin> already solved :)

 16:36 <jawn-smith> Okay let's skip curl then

 16:37 <jawn-smith> liushuyu: astroplan vs numpy?

 16:37 <jawn-smith> juliank: bcolz vs numpy?

 16:37 <liushuyu> jawn-smith: I can take this

 16:37 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 16:38 <jawn-smith> enr0n: deepnano vs numpy

 16:38 <jawn-smith> (sorry for the ping, hope you feel better)

 16:38 <jawn-smith> mwhudson: dipy vs numpy

 16:38 <ginggs> i have dipy

 16:38 <jawn-smith> mwhudson: dolfin vs numpy

 16:38 <jawn-smith> not dipy, ginggs will handle that

 16:38 <jawn-smith> vpa1977 einsteinpy vs numpy

 16:39 <jawn-smith> Okay now everybody has noe

 16:39 <jawn-smith> one*

 16:39 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 16:40 <jawn-smith> Compliance training needs to be done

 16:40 <jawn-smith> I'll be out for a week some time in February, but not sure which one yet
