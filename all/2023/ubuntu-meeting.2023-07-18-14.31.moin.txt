 14:31 <cpaelzer> plenty of people said hi already before the meeting got started

 14:31 <cpaelzer> so let me get going with the agenda

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:31 <sarnold> good morning

 14:31 <cpaelzer> rust -> fonts

 14:32 <cpaelzer> we know rust is temporarily demoted

 14:32 <cpaelzer> not suer why the fonts would show up now

 14:32 <cpaelzer> but given how things were int he past probably a false positive

 14:32 <slyon> cpaelzer: font's are only from the -doc packages, can be ignored

 14:32 <cpaelzer> ack

 14:32 <slyon> they will stay in universe

 14:32 <cpaelzer> then for actual fonts

 14:32 <sarnold> probably a previous mix of main vs universe binaries has been turned into "omg all these universe packages should be in main"

 14:32 <cpaelzer> fonts-liberation -> fonts-liberation-sans-narrow

 14:33 <cpaelzer> the former is a desktop package

 14:33 <cpaelzer> AFAIK those get a relative easy pass

 14:33 <cpaelzer> if they are really just fonts

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and there is no active code

 14:33 <cpaelzer> but we'd still want to see a bug that states that it is intentional and wanted

 14:33 <cpaelzer> because no matter how simple, the package will need an owner

 14:34 <didrocks> that was exactly my point

 14:34 <cpaelzer> didrocks: can you carry that to the desktop folks?

 14:34 <didrocks> sure, will do

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I feel like parrot

 14:34 <cpaelzer> the MIRs for the perl explosion will come

 14:34 <cpaelzer> soon (tm)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> jaraco seems almost ready right?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok joalif reviewed the last element recently

 14:36 <cpaelzer> todo is back on openstack

 14:36 <slyon> there are some open TODOs from joalif

 14:36 <cpaelzer> jamespage: ^^ FYI

 14:36 <cpaelzer> yep

 14:36 <cpaelzer> so far that is all I see in mismatches

 14:36 <cpaelzer> no further things that we need to act on in there right now

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:37 <cpaelzer> empty

 14:37 <cpaelzer> wow

 14:37 <sarnold> broken?

 14:37 <slyon> xD

 14:37 <joalif> lol

 14:37 * sarnold pokes launchpad with a stick

 14:37 <didrocks> zen attitude :p

 14:37 <dviererbe> o/

 14:37 <didrocks> don’t be as negative as sarnold :p

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:38 <cpaelzer> 5 incompletes with recent updates

 14:38 <cpaelzer> dhcpd I fixed the state as it has a few open todos left

 14:38 <cpaelzer> didrocks: did the same for aom

 14:39 <cpaelzer> libhttp-cookiejar-perl seems to be worked on by foundations

 14:39 <didrocks> python-rlpycairo and all reverse dependencies only used by hplip should be demoted it seems…

 14:39 <slyon> bug #2026608 I don't think this necessarily needs a security-review (considering lua has been in main for a while and covered by our security team), but maybe sarnold still wants to do a spot check and see if a full review would be useful (assign ubuntu-security, if you feel like)

 14:39 <slyon> didrocks: right. I brought that up with the desktop team, looks like we can demote hplip + dependencies later this cycle

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok, good on hplip+dependencies then

 14:40 <cpaelzer> slyon: I agree on 2026608

 14:40 <sarnold> slyon: ack, thanks

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: what do you think?

 14:41 <sarnold> I'm inclined to agree that it just needs a very quick once-over

 14:41 <cpaelzer> on the quality side I agree to slyons list

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we need to give it some love

 14:41 <cpaelzer> to make it better than it is

 14:41 <cpaelzer> Lena will ping back on the case once ready

 14:41 <cpaelzer> nothing for us to act now

 14:42 <cpaelzer> ok, next topic then

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:42 <cpaelzer> 31 and 17 wait

 14:42 <cpaelzer> blocked by other things

 14:42 <cpaelzer> but 33 and 32 I'd land if there are no objections

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thanks dviererbe btw for the quick reviews

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thoughts/complaints on https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/32 or https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/33 ?

 14:44 * slyon approved on GH

 14:44 <didrocks> the find calls needs to be on the built binary, no? Otherwise dh_fixperms will fix them if nothing special in debian/rules?

 14:44 <didrocks> (so unsure about those checks, I generally only rely on grepping)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> yeah, there might be more like postinst

 14:45 <cpaelzer> that is why my added line says "at least"

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I felt that people might check even less than the find and grep

 14:45 <cpaelzer> so wanted to provide a hint

 14:45 <cpaelzer> if you find suid set then one can have a look at fixperms and others

 14:46 <didrocks> right, my point is that find on the source package will not give you what you expect :)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> like the built binaries

 14:46 <didrocks> yeah

 14:46 <cpaelzer> TBH I expected to check both src and extracted debs or so

 14:46 <didrocks> and another question on the other on the other PR: why checking dbus in particular? (it’s all local)

 14:46 <sarnold> comments added to both

 14:46 <didrocks> we can say the same then on any unix socket?

 14:46 <cpaelzer> the case I looked at had dbus and that is just as much an "open port" of some sort

 14:47 <cpaelzer> since I didn't want to extend the list infinitely I added "dbus or similar"

 14:47 <cpaelzer> IHO, but I'm happy to discuss, any kind of listning turn into potential attack vectors right?

 14:47 <cpaelzer> +M

 14:48 <didrocks> hum, I kind of disagree for things that are listening "locally", in that sense, clients connecting to the system bus are even more harmful and don’t enter this list

 14:48 <didrocks> let’s iterate over the PRs

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ok then

 14:48 <cpaelzer> pstpone for the meeting

 14:48 <cpaelzer> throw the comments onto the PRs

 14:48 <cpaelzer> some of you already did

 14:48 <dviererbe> > I felt that people might check even less than the find and grep

 14:48 <dviererbe> Just a thought: Would that be a good idea to create a tool like check-mir that makes it easier for people to check for sid/gid if so many do it worng or don't do it at all?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I'll rework them and we can talk again here next time

 14:49 <cpaelzer> dviererbe: I found that often people then run the tool, do not know what/why it does, and then do fail to think e.g. about the new similar thing

 14:49 <sarnold> dviererbe: heh, yeah, I immediately wondered why we don't have an easy tool to find all the setuid/setgid files/directories in the packages

 14:49 <cpaelzer> you can write and maintain one :-)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> all the PR tries is to help with suggestions

 14:50 <sarnold> that's my fear

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I'm ok for now

 14:50 <cpaelzer> have enough on those to work on them

 14:50 <cpaelzer> going on in the agenda

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:50 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:50 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:50 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:50 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:50 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:51 <eslerm> I believe we are set. Big item is cargo being assigned to a reviewer

 14:52 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:52 <slyon> that's great to hear!

 14:52 <cpaelzer> dotnet is also bug

 14:52 <cpaelzer> big

 14:52 <cpaelzer> that does not have a face on it yet right?

 14:52 <sarnold> correct

 14:53 <cpaelzer> nvme-stast just entered the queue as I completed review this morning

 14:53 <sarnold> i'm worried that the "transition away from the dead package" story isn't quite complete yet

 14:53 <cpaelzer> also looking for a reviewer

 14:53 <cpaelzer> sarnold: well, we can wait for more details on this - but it would not block the security reivew would it?

 14:53 <sarnold> cpaelzer: no, but it is also probably more important than the security review

 14:54 <cpaelzer> it is required TODO #1 to clarify that further

 14:54 <sarnold> and I understand the discussion is underway

 14:55 <cpaelzer> Unless that is completed and approved as being sufficient it won't be promoted

 14:55 <sarnold> sounds good to me

 14:55 <cpaelzer> but to not lose too much time I think foundations would appreciate to enter the assigned security review queue

 14:55 <cpaelzer> I think we are ok on that, give it a thought if it could be assigned

 14:55 <cpaelzer> going on

 14:55 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:55 <cpaelzer> nothing here

 14:55 <didrocks> nothing either

 14:55 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:56 <joalif> just fyi, i wont be joining the next 4 mtgs

 14:56 <seb128> o/ :-)

 14:56 <joalif> bank holidays + pto

 14:56 <sarnold> joalif: nice :)

 14:56 <sarnold> heya seb128

 14:56 <seb128> quick one, the fonts-liberation-sans-narrow mentioned earlier

 14:56 <cpaelzer> impressive joalif :-)

 14:56 <seb128> it seems to be a rename from fonts-liberation

 14:56 <sarnold> oh yes, iirc next week is a midcycle sprint, are we intending to have this meeting next week?

 14:56 <seb128> basically Debian did

 14:57 <seb128> fonts-liberation2 -> fonts-liberation

 14:57 <seb128> and

 14:57 <cpaelzer> on time off, there will be a sprint this (not much impact) and next (more impact) week that keeps people busy

 14:57 <seb128> fonts-liberation -> fonts-liberation-sans-narrow

 14:57 <cpaelzer> I'd appreciate, due to the sprint, someone taking over for me next week

 14:57 <seb128> because that's the only font remaining provided by the old srcname

 14:57 <seb128> do we still need a MIR?

 14:57 <didrocks> (same, I will be in the sprint, so if someone else is free to take over…)

 14:57 <slyon> cpaelzer: I can probably run the meeting next week.

 14:58 <cpaelzer> seb128: file a bug and explain, so there is an audit trail. Does not need to be a full MIR template

 14:58 <seb128> cpaelzer, ack, thanks

 14:58 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon

 14:58 <cpaelzer> ok then, seems we are done for today

 14:58 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all

 14:58 <joalif> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 14:58 <dviererbe> thanks, all

 14:58 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 14:58 <cpaelzer> joalif:  we will keep the best cases open for when you are back then :-P

 14:58 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
