 14:33 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:33 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:33:55 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:33 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> non-proposed only has false positives and the known rustc case

 14:34 <cpaelzer> and -proposed only adds the known jaraco tree

 14:34 <cpaelzer> nothing new to act on as far as I'm concerned

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <cpaelzer> three cases, none of them entirely new

 14:35 <cpaelzer> 1. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rustc/+bug/1957932

 14:36 <cpaelzer> waits for the three sub-bugs to be complete

 14:37 <cpaelzer> eslerm: wsa driving 1991650 with foundations

 14:38 <cpaelzer> eslerm: sarnold: I have a hard time parsing the state of https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/http-parser/+bug/1990655

 14:38 <eslerm> I did not do the initial review, but the conditional ack which was there seemed unfair

 14:39 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:39 <cpaelzer> and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cargo/+bug/1993819 seems ok

 14:39 <cpaelzer> but this seems more like "the involved people need to get together, ensure that all is in place and then promote" than a task we can distribute here

 14:39 <didrocks> agreed

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I'd go to the other two cases to have a look

 14:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/s390-tools/+bug/2030482

 14:40 <cpaelzer> schopin: this looks like waiting for a review

 14:40 <cpaelzer> is that correct?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I see description updates, setting the state so it shows up here, ...

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I'm totally+20% unable to take on a review atm :-/

 14:41 <cpaelzer> didrocks: joalif: any of you open to have a look at this one?

 14:42 <joalif> i could

 14:42 <cpaelzer> thank you

 14:42 <cpaelzer> next in queue is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libde265/+bug/2004449

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Known tasks left, setting to incomplete

 14:43 <didrocks> yeah, bad status apparently

 14:43 <cpaelzer> fixed

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:44 <cpaelzer> most are of last weeks meeting or just now

 14:44 <cpaelzer> the only one in between has been

 14:44 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pappl-retrofit/+bug/2031814

 14:45 <didrocks> well, it should stays a NACK for now, no?

 14:45 <cpaelzer> yep

 14:45 <cpaelzer> it just got additionally untergetted from 23.10 - due to that it shows up as recent

 14:45 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:45 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:45 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:45 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:46 <cpaelzer> uh

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I missed getting feedback on https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/40

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I can work on that, all seems quick and easy to address

 14:46 <cpaelzer> and thereby closing one of the open issues

 14:47 <cpaelzer> the rest AFAICS are ok to stay as is

 14:47 <cpaelzer> no one had time to make progress on package sets or re-review

 14:47 <didrocks> Iâ€™ll look at #40

 14:47 <cpaelzer> and the externally created branch stayed a riddle

 14:47 <cpaelzer> thanks didrocks, I'll myself address anything in the PR tomorrow morning

 14:47 <cpaelzer> and then it most likely is ready to be meregd

 14:47 <cpaelzer> or rather "merged"

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=[MIR]&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:48 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:48 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:49 <eslerm> Security is on a sprint, not much to update on our side

 14:49 <cpaelzer> thanks for that info

 14:49 <cpaelzer> I hope you got a nice place to be at

 14:49 <cpaelzer> I see you added the first few perl packages to the queue

 14:49 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:50 <eslerm> libmysofa is currently waiting for upstream to respond, doesn't look too promising

 14:50 <eslerm> we're in Spain \o/

 14:50 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:50 <cpaelzer> one question

 14:50 <cpaelzer> and worst case you can carry that to the sprint

 14:50 <cpaelzer> what is the state on  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openscap/+bug/1877696

 14:51 <eslerm> mothballed, the package has serious issues and upstream needs support

 14:51 <cpaelzer> that is mostly a question for intent/timing as otherwise it will sit in the queues forever

 14:51 <cpaelzer> oh really

 14:51 <cpaelzer> mothballed

 14:51 <cpaelzer> hmm

 14:51 <eslerm> owning team (Security) would need to designate engineering time to resolve upstream issues

 14:51 <cpaelzer> will there be a cut-off marking it incomplete and out of the queue then?

 14:52 <eslerm> our oval scanner is based on it

 14:52 <cpaelzer> hmm, ok

 14:52 <cpaelzer> do not remove it then :-)

 14:52 <eslerm> https://ubuntu.com/security/oval

 14:52 <cpaelzer> happy to keep it there, I was just curious

 14:52 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> not from the server team

 14:52 <eslerm> I'll raise this to the team :)

 14:53 <didrocks> nothing for me

 14:53 <cpaelzer> we are short on attendees today

 14:54 <cpaelzer> eslerm: anything from you or security?

 14:54 <eslerm> nothing from us

 14:54 <cpaelzer> then we have everyone

 14:54 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:54 <cpaelzer> post FF keeps being the only silent time

 14:54 <cpaelzer> gladly

 14:54 <cpaelzer> o/

 14:54 <didrocks> yeah, gladly :)

 14:54 <eslerm> thanks cpaelzer and didrocks o/

 14:54 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
