 15:06 <ddstreet> probably should go through all the agenda items, though i've been busy with other work and summertime vacations so unfortunately i dont think i've done much of anything

 15:06 <ddstreet> #topic previous action items

 15:07 <ddstreet> #subtopic ddstreet send follow up email on no-bug-required ML thread mentioning cockpit

 15:08 <ddstreet> i did this one! :) and i think it's been resolved?

 15:08 <mapreri> nope

 15:08 <ddstreet> i have not caught up on my email, just got back today

 15:08 <mapreri> I mean, you did the followup, but we haven't follow up again on the topic

 15:08 <ddstreet> ah ok

 15:08 <mapreri> oh wait

 15:08 <mapreri> this is specific to cockpit

 15:08 <ddstreet> oh this is the no-bug-required one

 15:08 <mapreri> wait

 15:08 * mapreri spawns up mails

 15:09 <ddstreet> the cockpit self-approvals issue is separate i think

 15:09 * ddstreet been gone too long, brain needs to catch up

 15:09 <teward> (and handled)

 15:09 <mapreri> so, the pitti issues has finally been handled, though I do have some questions after reading his answer.

 15:09 <ddstreet> lemme go read that also

 15:10 <teward> so did I.  It took the TB poking pitti to get attention, I don't accept their reasoning of simply sinkholing everything going to their ubuntu.com address but i cant validate any of that on their end

 15:11 <teward> and yes i did escalate it to the TB for intervention / poking

 15:11 <mapreri> well, let's just say that his "I'm not reading this email because it's only spam" is bullshit in my mind, so I want to dig deeper in there, since AFAIK we did try to reach him on multiple addresses.  And our thing has been announced in ubuntu-devel-announce (IIRC), so one reason less for him not knowing, soâ€¦   but yes, I believe it's handled enough for now.

 15:11 <teward> i brought those concerns up with the TB in a reply myself but it got eaten by my email so i have to resend it

 15:11 <mapreri> teward: you mean the points I raised?

 15:12 <teward> but yeah theres concerns at play, but at least Martin seems willing to work in the new processes

 15:12 <teward> mapreri: and others I am not at liberty of bringing up publicly or I'd have to eat my many hats

 15:12 <mapreri> heh

 15:12 <mapreri> then ok, I think I'll leave everything to you, thank you

 15:13 <teward> yep, the key was to poke Martin and get it handled such that he stops self approving.  And I rejected his reasons as well for not replying prior.

 15:13 <mapreri> ddstreet: the actual "no-bug-required" topic is further down, btw, this seems to be specific to cockpit/pitti.

 15:13 <ddstreet> i'll read the full escalation TB thread later, it seems like for now his response seems fine and i think he did recently upload a new version to backports and did not self-approve

 15:13 <teward> and he has agreed to abide by our processes so.

 15:14 <ddstreet> yep, let's drop this action item as it seems done

 15:14 <mapreri> yes

 15:14 <ddstreet> #subtopic ddstreet send short policy wording proposal to ML regarding https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023030.html

 15:14 <ddstreet> i guess we should keep this on the ML, unless either of you want to discuss it now?

 15:15 <mapreri> not now

 15:15 <ddstreet> ack

 15:18 <ddstreet> ack

 15:19 <mapreri> I was reading that bug about nfs-utils, I missed the last answer from the OP.  But I believe it's fine as it is (i.e., rejected)

 15:20 <ddstreet> yep i agree

 15:20 <ddstreet> ok moving on

 15:20 <ddstreet> #subtopic teward make sure there are no bugs in requestbackport and backportpackage tools (in lunar) (carried over)

 15:22 * meetingology teward make sure there are no bugs in requestbackport and backportpackage tools (in lunar) (carried over)

 15:23 <teward> (had bigger fish to fry since that was put on so)

 15:23 <ddstreet> ack, no worried

 15:23 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:23 <ddstreet> should we carry this or move to ML? or discuss now?

 15:23 <mapreri> keep it here

 15:23 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:23 * meetingology (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:24 <ddstreet> works for me :)

 15:24 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) check if backports pocket uploads and/or approvals go to a ML

 15:24 <ddstreet> probably should assign this to someone to look into ?

 15:24 <ddstreet> teward you have any extra time to look into this?

 15:24 <mapreri> imho better keep it in the backburner until we catch up with the rest, unless either of you want to take it on.

 15:24 <teward> nope no spare cycles

 15:25 <teward> FT job eats all my cycles atm

 15:25 <ddstreet> ack, yeah let's keep it here then

 15:25 <ddstreet> me as well, yeah

 15:25 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) check if backports pocket uploads and/or approvals go to a ML (carried over)

 15:25 * meetingology (unassigned) check if backports pocket uploads and/or approvals go to a ML (carried over)

 15:25 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) if no ML for backports uploads/approvals, check on how to create one

 15:25 * meetingology (unassigned) if no ML for backports uploads/approvals, check on how to create one (carried over)

 15:26 <ddstreet> that's all the previous action items; moving on to ML threads unless anyone has any other previous items to discuss

 15:26 <teward> nope but i have a time crunch so can i bring a different item up ahead of ml threads

 15:26 <ddstreet> sure

 15:27 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 15:27 <teward> i will need one of you two to poke distro-info later today

 15:27 <teward> i am reuploading after a self reject due to version strinfs

 15:27 <teward> strings*

 15:27 <mapreri> is it fine to accept it?

 15:27 <teward> this is the pings from cpaelzer_ in devel yesterdat

 15:27 <teward> mapreri: cpaelzer_ said yeah but i made a screwup with version strings so gonna fix and reup

 15:27 <mapreri> I mean, I have no cycles today or tomorrow to actually confidently look at things.  for me it would be better if I did it next week.

 15:28 <mapreri> (and I believe it can wait)

 15:28 <teward> ack just putting it on the list

 15:28 <ddstreet> if it's not complicated, i can take a look today or tomorrow

 15:28 <ddstreet> i'll keep it in mind to try to get to this week

 15:29 <ddstreet> otherwise mapreri can tackle it next week :)

 15:29 <mapreri> ^^

 15:29 <teward> yep this or next week is fine but wanted it on the list

 15:30 <ddstreet> since we're in AOB, anything else to discuss before going back to regular agenda?

 15:30 <mapreri> so, right now we have one open bug (which is a reject, launchpad will expire it in 10 days)

 15:30 <mapreri> and in the queue there is only cockpit from pitti

 15:30 <teward> i'm being pulled into a meeting @ work so i need to nip out but will read back after.

 15:30 <mapreri> are we going to ask him for bug or shall we just look at it as it is?

 15:30 <teward> *whooshes out*

 15:30 <mapreri> teward: o/

 15:32 <ddstreet> i can take a look at the cockpit backports, if they are the typical 'no-change' backports that we usually don't require bugs for, i think it's ok to just approve without a bug

 15:32 <ddstreet> unless you think we should ask for a bug at least for the first cockpit we approve

 15:32 <mapreri> that was pretty much my question

 15:33 <ddstreet> how about if i see *anything* that i have a question about i'll ask for a bug, otherwise if the backports look fine and i have no q's i'll approve them without a bug

 15:33 <mapreri> the wording for the no-bug-required thing I was thinking of was indeed to require the bug for the first upload to series, and then not require a new it if it's only no-change with no real risk to it (and instead just keep referring the old bug in the changelog also for the new updates).

 15:34 <mapreri> that would work for me.

 15:34 <mapreri> It would be unfair to ask for a bug for a process that has not been defined (the no-bug-required thing) when we are silently accepting simple no-change updates.

 15:35 <ddstreet> yep, once we have the policy in place it should be easier

 15:35 <ddstreet> i'll action that at least

 15:35 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet review cockpit backport uploads

 15:35 * meetingology ddstreet review cockpit backport uploads

 15:35 <mapreri> ty

 15:36 <mapreri> no further AOB from me today

 15:36 <ddstreet> #subtopic ML threads

 15:36 <ddstreet> #undo

 15:36 <meetingology> Removing item from minutes: SUBTOPIC

 15:36 <ddstreet> #topic ML threads

 15:36 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:36 <ddstreet> i think this is the only ML thread? at least, in the agenda

 15:36 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022680.html

 15:36 <ddstreet> no movement for a while on it

 15:37 <ddstreet> i'll send another ping to try to keep it alive :)

 15:37 <mapreri> ty

 15:37 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet ping email to keep thread alive: clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:37 * meetingology ddstreet ping email to keep thread alive: clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:37 <ddstreet> i think that's everything, besides picking a next mtg date?

 15:38 <mapreri> yes

 15:38 <ddstreet> #subtopic next mtg date

 15:38 <mapreri> according to my calendar, regular schedule would say Oct 18th?

 15:38 <mapreri> ah, no, sorry  wrong ubuntu team

 15:38 <ddstreet> 4 weeks as 'usual' would be Oct 25

 15:38 <mapreri> not in my recurring calendar?

 15:39 <ddstreet> yeah we've been just doing one-off mtgs so far, though we could switch to recurring

 15:39 <mapreri> oh, was it you sending gcal invite?

 15:39 <ddstreet> yep

 15:39 <ddstreet> after each mtg

 15:39 <mapreri> see, it has been too long since the last meeting i forgot!

 15:39 <ddstreet> lol

 15:39 <ddstreet> maybe we should just commit to monthly mtgs?

 15:39 <mapreri> I'm fine with oct 25

 15:39 <mapreri> would normally wfm

 15:40 <ddstreet> sounds good, i'll set up the next for oct 25 and set it as recurring every 4 weeks, and we can cancel/resched as needed

 15:40 <mapreri> hold on

 15:40 <mapreri> the 25th is right before the DST change

 15:40 <mapreri> what about after?

 15:41 <mapreri> I'm keen on keeping this at 5pm Europe/Rome time :>

 15:41 <ddstreet> in the past, we were sticking with DST

 15:41 <ddstreet> US DST change is first sunday in Nov, so i think it would be the same time

 15:42 <mapreri> let's just schedule next 25th that's before the change, and let's growl at DST next week ^^

 15:42 <mapreri> s/week$/meeting/

 15:42 <ddstreet> sounds good

 15:42 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet sched next mtg oct 25

 15:42 * meetingology ddstreet sched next mtg oct 25

 15:42 <ddstreet> isn't the EU getting rid of DST?

 15:42 <mapreri> ahahahaha

 15:43 <mapreri> that will happen after whatever next "crisis" pass

 15:43 <mapreri> but then postponed to the after the next-next crisis, I'm sure

 15:43 <ddstreet> lol yeah i dont see the US dropping it anytime soon either

 15:44 <ddstreet> ok i think we're wrapped

 15:44 <ddstreet> any final items?

 15:44 <mapreri> none from me

 15:44 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
