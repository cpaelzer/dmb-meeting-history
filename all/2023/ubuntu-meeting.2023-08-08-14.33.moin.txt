 14:33 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:33 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:33:07 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:33 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 14:33 <cpaelzer> glad to be back after the sprint

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I hope there was no panic here

 14:33 <slyon> It was pretty calm

 14:33 <cpaelzer> let us get the normal agenda points covered

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and then get to any open things left in AOB

 14:33 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> mirespace still supposed to work on the MIR of the perl deps

 14:34 <cpaelzer> let me ping here again

 14:34 <slyon> Those look pretty usual, except for dnspython, which was resolved today and will go away.

 14:34 <cpaelzer> sorry for this overview not being readable again

 14:35 <cpaelzer> is it the same

 14:35 <slyon> Also, python-jsonschema is growing some more Recommends (cc jamespage)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> I do not remember python-jsonschema

 14:35 <cpaelzer> to python-rfc3987 and webcolors

 14:35 <cpaelzer> oh yeah

 14:35 <cpaelzer> good

 14:35 <cpaelzer> so it was not just my memory

 14:35 <sarnold> Tue 01 14:32:59 < slyon> python-jsonschema seems new, and needs to be looked at by the openstack team (cc jamespage)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> oh, so there was no reply since

 14:36 <cpaelzer> let me do the same ping on #openstack internally to ensure they see it

 14:36 <cpaelzer> might have been lost in the sprint

 14:37 <cpaelzer> done

 14:37 <slyon> TIL: interestingly the Recommends (as in python-jsonschema case) are not enforced by britney, so that package migrated, even though it has component mismatches

 14:37 <cpaelzer> that is ... unexpected

 14:38 <cpaelzer> did you talk last week about python-reportlab?

 14:38 <slyon> according to v_orlon this has been the case ever since

 14:38 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes. reportlab is going to be demoted this cycle (once the desktop team demoted the printing stack)

 14:38 <sarnold> heh, maybe https://bugs.launchpad.net/britney/+bug/1593148 ought to get a priority boost?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> ok, waiting for that then

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:38 <cpaelzer> none

 14:38 <cpaelzer> wow

 14:38 <cpaelzer> nice

 14:38 <cpaelzer> for once!

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:39 <cpaelzer> so slyon commented on s390x tools

 14:39 <eslerm> (from components, is rustc still an approved MIR?)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> eslerm:  it can only find and color one

 14:39 <cpaelzer> so it finds the old rustc

 14:39 <eslerm> thanks

 14:39 <cpaelzer> not the new cargo+rustc one

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok I see that Mirespace worked on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmail-dmarc-perl/+bug/2023971 recently

 14:40 <cpaelzer> not ready yet but that update is expected

 14:40 <cpaelzer> what is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcpcd/+bug/2019191 about ... ?

 14:40 <slyon> s390-tools is a heads-up for everybody. It will start to pull in vendored rust dependencies. And it was not super clear how to handle them from a MIR/security perspective. Do we need a new MIR?

 14:40 <slyon> cc schopin ^

 14:40 <slyon> cc fheimes ^

 14:40 <cpaelzer> hmm, we didn't add re-MIR in the past

 14:41 * schopin pops his head in.

 14:41 <cpaelzer> but this is a rather big change

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I think they can ask for acceptance and re-review on the old MIR bug

 14:41 <slyon> I created that bug, to have some starting point for a discussion

 14:41 <cpaelzer> but I'm not sure about it

 14:42 <slyon> sarnold: what's your perspective on packages in main pulling in new (vendored) dependencies?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> IMHO (and that really is opinion for now) - they should re-review, but we haven't put re-review of any kind in-process yet

 14:42 <slyon> would it be a normal package dependency, we would probably handle it through the component-mismatches process and have all of the dependencies MIRed

 14:43 <cpaelzer> mostly to avoid people getting things approved while trivial and then exploding complexity without ensuring quality and maintainability

 14:43 <sarnold> we normally assume that some reasonable amount of changes over time are just going to happen, and that's fine, but this sounds like it might be a pretty big set of changes. maybe we ought to try to use 'package churn' as a guide for our "re-review old packages" stretch goal?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: do they have to be vendored?

 14:43 <eslerm> this seems to be a meta package https://github.com/ibm-s390-linux/s390-tools

 14:43 <schopin> The MIR rules state that they do :)

 14:43 <slyon> cpaelzer: Probably yes. Those are rust crates

 14:44 <sarnold> .. and maybe at the birth of a new ecosystem is a good time to try to encourage 'good taste' in selecting which crates to vendor? not that we've got *that* much influence over upstream authors..

 14:44 <schopin> This specific upstream should be easier to work with than most.

 14:44 <sarnold> yeah

 14:45 <schopin> But then there's the issue of the *version* of the crates we want them to use.

 14:45 <cpaelzer> yep the rules were written with the ecosystem of the time in mind

 14:45 <slyon> So we basically ask for a new s390-tools MIR and will see what that brings (I expect lots of work, as those are big crates)

 14:45 <sarnold> and since the goal is to get it to compile with the new tools, today, on an oddball architecture, they'll have a very strong incentive to make sure it actually works in the places where rust feels weakest

 14:46 <cpaelzer> slyon: yes, that would be helpful I think

 14:46 <cpaelzer> let us continue for now

 14:46 <cpaelzer> and to close this section out, dhcpcd - is that the one you meant will resolve in a bit slyon?

 14:47 <slyon> no. I was talking about dnspython

 14:47 <cpaelzer> oh

 14:47 <cpaelzer> so laste ocmment on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcpcd/+bug/2019191

 14:47 <sarnold> dhcpcd is probably waiting on tobias to replace non-fips-approved code with fips-approved-code

 14:47 <cpaelzer> yeah, thanks for cleaning up the assignment

 14:47 <cpaelzer> to make it clear who we wait on

 14:48 <slyon> (schopin I will tag bug #2030482 as rls-mm-incoming, so we can assign the MIR to somebody in the next ubuntu-meeting)

 14:48 <schopin> fair enough :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=[MIR]&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:48 <slyon> Right. I should probably ping tobhe and/or bdrung about dhcpcd

 14:49 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:49 <eslerm> initial libmysofa MIR is in review. We need upstream followup to decide on promotion--reviewer on PTO. dropping libmysofa-utils from promotion would help. @seb128

 14:49 <eslerm> libwebm and nvme-stas MIRs are drafted and in review. likely to be published this week

 14:49 <eslerm> dasbus will be taken when nmve-stas is complete

 14:49 <eslerm> dotnet6 MIR s in progress

 14:49 <eslerm> Security's fdk-aac review is blocked downstream, Desktop may have an alternative package to promote

 14:50 <cpaelzer> that all sounds fine IMHO - thanks for the update. Anything else to add sarnold or anyone?

 14:50 <slyon> eslerm: do we get our ETA for rust/cargo today?

 14:50 <bdrung> slyon, i talked with tobhe yesterday. He will prepare the patches for using openssl that I can hopefully upload today or tomorrow.

 14:50 <slyon> bdrung: sounds great, thanks

 14:50 <cpaelzer> great, thanks for the info bdrung

 14:50 <eslerm> yes, cargo MIR draft is complete and in review as of today

 14:50 <sarnold> slyon: one better :) pfsmorigo has posted a review for review :) it's on us to take a look and iterate on it

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I was shuffling agenda items unintentionally

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:51 <cpaelzer> as I posted https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/31 can land now

 14:51 <cpaelzer> everyone that might later complain has approved

 14:51 <didrocks> \o/

 14:51 <cpaelzer> anyone wants to use the last change of stopping me?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 3

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 2

 14:52 <sarnold> uhoh, is this the "supervillian transformation moment"? :)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 1

 14:52 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:52 <jbicha> is this AOB?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> no

 14:52 <slyon> not yet jbicha

 14:52 <cpaelzer> this is the issue/Pr section

 14:52 <cpaelzer> merged

 14:52 <cpaelzer> how about https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/33 ?

 14:53 <cpaelzer> did we settle enough on this

 14:53 <cpaelzer> spelling is fixed

 14:53 <cpaelzer> and I thought most of the discussion should be in

 14:53 <cpaelzer> I'm context switching in this case ...

 14:54 <cpaelzer> didrocks: I think your comment is the only one I have not yet addressed

 14:54 <sarnold> the package build log note was a nice one

 14:54 <cpaelzer> oh actually I think I have added binary and source

 14:54 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:54 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/33/files#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5R881

 14:54 <cpaelzer> didrocks: are you fine as well then?

 14:55 <didrocks> cpaelzer: that’s correct, I would have preferred we dig a little bit deeper in it: but TBH, no time for this… So good enough as is

 14:55 <cpaelzer> I didn't want to explode complexity

 14:55 <cpaelzer> PRs welcome :-P

 14:55 <cpaelzer> let us merge it then and anyone is free to extend at another day

 14:55 <cpaelzer> ok?

 14:55 <didrocks> understandable :)

 14:55 <sarnold> ack

 14:56 <cpaelzer> done

 14:56 <cpaelzer> then last new before AOB

 14:56 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/35

 14:56 <cpaelzer> I think this is a good topic to have

 14:56 <cpaelzer> but breaking the time we have

 14:56 <slyon> ^ This is something I was thinking about today.

 14:56 <cpaelzer> can we declare review and discussion homework until next week?

 14:56 <slyon> Not necessarily needed right now. But maybe everybody could have a look eventually and leave their comments

 14:57 <cpaelzer> I've added it to my "to review" list

 14:57 <cpaelzer> thanks for starting the thought

 14:57 <slyon> cc schopin, too ^

 14:57 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:57 <cpaelzer> jbicha: now :-)

 14:57 <cpaelzer> nothing from server this week btw

 14:58 <jbicha> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei will be a new dependency for Mutter 45 for Desktop so I'm letting y'all know that will be a rush and coming soon

 14:58 <sarnold> mmm eis

 14:58 <cpaelzer> jbicha: what is your gut-feeling on quality of it?

 14:59 <cpaelzer> libEgg :-)

 14:59 <cpaelzer> thanks for the heads up

 14:59 <slyon> jbicha: we can usually do promotions post feature freeze. So as long as you can get your changes in (e.g. using FFe), we should still have some time. But that's for the heads-up!

 14:59 <cpaelzer> jbicha: you can file this asap even before the dependency is there

 14:59 <cpaelzer> so that we can start to review next week

 15:00 <cpaelzer> ok, anything else - or can we close?

 15:00 <slyon> thanks*

 15:00 <cpaelzer> 5

 15:00 <cpaelzer> 7

 15:00 <cpaelzer> 8

 15:00 <sarnold> nothing here

 15:00 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
