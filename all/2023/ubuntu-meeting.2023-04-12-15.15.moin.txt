 15:18 <ddstreet> oops

 15:18 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri review wiki page to see how we can highlight that backport requestors need to do the backport work and find a sponsor (carried over)

 15:18 <ddstreet> typo

 15:18 <mapreri> carry over as well

 15:19 <ddstreet> carry as well i assume?

 15:19 <mapreri> well, that didn't happen either, yap

 15:19 <ddstreet> #action mapreri start thread on ML about how to use bug status to define meaing in process (carried over)

 15:19 * meetingology mapreri start thread on ML about how to use bug status to define meaing in process (carried over)

 15:19 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp) (carried over)

 15:19 <ddstreet> want to keep carrying this one too?

 15:19 <mapreri> mhh, I could move it into my own private list, since it's not really team related

 15:19 <mapreri> so that I don't abuse of the meeting agenda u.u

 15:20 <ddstreet> ack, works for me

 15:20 <ddstreet> #subtopic teward make sure there are no bugs in requestbackport and backportpackage tools (in lunar)

 15:20 <teward> there's brokenness

 15:20 <teward> i pinged about it before but i'll double check

 15:20 <teward> requestbackport still includes all the interim releases in the checkmarks, etc.

 15:20 <teward> which is a problem

 15:20 <teward> backportpackage hangs but I haven't dug deeply into why yet

 15:21 <ddstreet> is it lp: #2013237 ?

 15:21 <teward> potentially, but not confirmed, it literally just hung and never did anything so I have to run more tests

 15:21 <teward> welcome to "never enough cycles"

 15:21 <teward> :p

 15:21 <ddstreet> ack ok, lol, let's carry this one then

 15:21 <ddstreet> #action teward make sure there are no bugs in requestbackport and backportpackage tools (in lunar) (carried over)

 15:21 * meetingology teward make sure there are no bugs in requestbackport and backportpackage tools (in lunar) (carried over)

 15:22 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:22 <ddstreet> should we assign this one? or maybe move it to ML thread? or just carry it unassigned?

 15:22 <teward> i'd move it to ML

 15:22 <mapreri> I'd carry i tover

 15:22 <ddstreet> lol

 15:23 <mapreri> we already have too much unfinished ml threads

 15:23 <teward> but either way works for me

 15:23 <mapreri> let's finish some first.

 15:23 <ddstreet> ack sounds good, let's just carry then

 15:23 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:23 * meetingology (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 15:23 <ddstreet> ok that's all previous items

 15:23 <ddstreet> #topic open mailing list threads

 15:24 <ddstreet> there is the one i just replied to, to keep alive

 15:24 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:24 <mapreri> ("moving to ml" would mean moving it from the "previous items" to the "open ml threads" section, soâ€¦ :P)

 15:24 <ddstreet> yeah...on the agenda either way :)

 15:24 <mapreri> indeed I don't think this one needs further words in irc right now

 15:24 <ddstreet> #action clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:24 * meetingology clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:25 <mapreri> (â€¦*on* irc?)

 15:25 <ddstreet> #undo

 15:25 <meetingology> Removing item from minutes: ACTION

 15:25 <ddstreet> maybe action in ML?

 15:25 <ddstreet> er, on ML?

 15:25 <mapreri> don't?

 15:25 <mapreri> if there is a link add that perhaps

 15:26 <ddstreet> it's linked in the agenda, yeah

 15:26 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022680.html

 15:26 <mapreri> alright, then just move on, no #action needed imho ^^

 15:26 <ddstreet> yeah

 15:26 <ddstreet> are there other threads?

 15:27 <ddstreet> I suppose i'll just mention this one

 15:27 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023048.html

 15:27 <ddstreet> i dont think any more action is needed, just fyi

 15:27 <mapreri> ohh

 15:27 <ddstreet> i think it was just unawareness of the new process

 15:27 <mapreri> I have been having some troubles keeping up with emails in the past few months, that one slipped past me

 15:28 <mapreri> thank you for bringing it up

 15:28 <mapreri> ddstreet: there was no answer to that mail?

 15:28 <ddstreet> no, not that i saw

 15:28 <mapreri> also, how did you notice, ooi?

 15:29 <ddstreet> i highlight in irc on 'backports' so i saw in ubuntu-release the upload and approval (back-to-back) and wondered who was doing it

 15:29 <ddstreet> since a back-to-back upload and approval is rare for the backports queue

 15:29 <teward> unless prediscussed by the backporters team like for memtest

 15:29 <ddstreet> right

 15:29 <ddstreet> anyway i'm sure it was just honest misunderstanding

 15:30 <mapreri> I wonder if we could get something like the accept mails go to the ML

 15:30 <mapreri> and if we could, should we..

 15:30 <teward> maybe.  i know that cockpit was a special case in the previous backporters team before we were in charge and it had a special approval for always being backported because of whatever it was needed for being chaotic.

 15:30 <teward> but we reserve the right as the backporters team to redo that analysis and require them to refile for exceptions, etc.

 15:31 <ddstreet> i think there is a ML for uploads/approvals for updates pocket, isn't there? not sure if that includes backports pocket too

 15:31 <mapreri> indeed, and such exception if it's there should be documented in the "exceptions" section of our documentation

 15:31 <mapreri> I wasn't aware src:cockpit was special in any wayâ€¦

 15:31 <teward> it's shown up on the radar in the past and i remember it from that

 15:31 <teward> but i don't remember the reasoning nor do i have those emails anymore

 15:32 <ddstreet> should we add an action for someone to look into 1) do uploads and/or approvals go to ML? 2) if not, do we want a ML for it?

 15:32 <teward> so it wouldn't hurt to have them explain why it needs such

 15:33 <mapreri> ddstreet: I'd say those + 3) check with somebody if cockpit needs some special handlingâ€¦?

 15:33 <ddstreet> i suspect the 'exceptions' where people can self-approve would be rarely useful, as the uploader would also need archive approval rights, which severely limits the number of uploaders who can self-approve

 15:33 <mapreri> not that I'm volounteering for any of them, but I'd write them down so that in the future somebody will u.u

 15:33 <mapreri> ddstreet: rather, it would be an exception where those packages/uploaders wouldn't need our review and skip the bug filing stage.

 15:34 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) check if backports pocket uploads and/or approvals go to a ML

 15:34 * meetingology (unassigned) check if backports pocket uploads and/or approvals go to a ML

 15:34 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) if no ML for backports uploads/approvals, check on how to create one

 15:34 * meetingology (unassigned) if no ML for backports uploads/approvals, check on how to create one

 15:34 <ddstreet> mapreri so would still need one of us to approve it, but basically a 'no-review' approval?

 15:35 <mapreri> to be defined/discussed in the exception granting process :)

 15:37 <ddstreet> so should we action specifically for cockpit, and/or should we action on adding generic wiki doc in the 'special cases' section for 'preapproved packages' (or similar wording)?

 15:37 <ddstreet> the 'special case' generic i think probably should be discussed a bit more, maybe on ML though we don't seem to get thru much there recently :)

 15:38 <ddstreet> maybe let's put an action for the next mtg to discuss the 'special case' for no-review-needed packages

 15:38 <mapreri> I was thinking for cockpit.  the discussion would be about "should cockpit be added to the "special cases" section?  If so, with what terms?

 15:39 <ddstreet> we could consider cockpit first, though i suspect other pkgs would fall into a very similar category, e.g. gallery-dl comes to mind

 15:39 <ddstreet> we do still have 20 min this mtg if we want to discuss now?

 15:39 <ddstreet> or we can action for next mtg

 15:39 <mapreri> I'd say next week

 15:39 <mapreri> but

 15:40 <mapreri> hold on

 15:40 <ddstreet> (this seems very similar to the 'no-bug-needed' ML thread situation too)

 15:40 <mapreri> would most/all of this fall in the already open case of no-bug-required backport exception ML thread

 15:40 <mapreri> ...

 15:40 <mapreri> :P

 15:40 <ddstreet> lol

 15:40 <ddstreet> i agree :)

 15:41 <mapreri> I have no idea about he cockpit case, so no clue

 15:41 <ddstreet> let's roll it into that ML discussion if that sounds ok to you

 15:41 <mapreri> possibly, yes.

 15:41 <ddstreet> i'll send a follow up email on that thread specifically mentioning cockpit

 15:41 <ddstreet> so we don't forget

 15:42 <mapreri> ta

 15:42 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet send follow up email on no-bug-required ML thread mentioning cockpit

 15:42 * meetingology ddstreet send follow up email on no-bug-required ML thread mentioning cockpit

 15:42 <ddstreet> ok any more for this ML thread, on cockpit?

 15:42 <mapreri> nothing more from me

 15:43 <ddstreet> I think there is another thread that came from the memtest86+ upload

 15:43 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023030.html

 15:44 <ddstreet> basically, it took long enough for me to sponsor that there was a new upload in lunar, which required asking the backporter to provide a new backport version

 15:44 <ddstreet> generally, i think it's best to ask them for the latest version, but my concern is if it gets into long delays because the sponsorship (or review/approval) takes so long that the backport and/or upload becomes out of date

 15:45 <mapreri> I'd say that's fine, but still, part of the responsibilities of the backporters is to keep the bpo up2date, so a new one will come "soon enough" anyway.

 15:46 <ddstreet> you're saying it's fine to accept the older-version upload, or to ask the backporter to provide a newer backport?

 15:47 <ddstreet> i also think it will (hopefully) be rare, so maybe we should wait until/if it is a problem to make any decision

 15:47 <mapreri> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports#Future_Maintenance_of_the_Backport mentions that "The backporter is responsible for [â€¦] additional updates that should be backported" - which indeed is not quite clear on what those "additioanl updates" are, but to me it means that any further update done on the base suite should also be backported?

 15:48 <mapreri> so

 15:48 <mapreri> if just the process takes too long, accepting an older version is ok for me, with the assumption that a newer one will be forthcoming.

 15:49 <ddstreet> i'm in agreement. maybe instead of a end-user policy for this, we should just add a team-internal policy roughly stating this?

 15:49 <ddstreet> i.e. something on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports/Policies instead of docs on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports

 15:49 <ddstreet> i can draft something short and send to the ML

 15:50 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet send short policy wording proposal to ML regarding https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023030.html

 15:50 * meetingology ddstreet send short policy wording proposal to ML regarding https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023030.html

 15:50 <mapreri> I don't think it needs writing down, but guess that if there is doubts always better to clarify, so drafts welcome! :)

 15:51 <ddstreet> i think that's all ML threads, unless i missed something

 15:52 <ddstreet> #subtopic open bugs

 15:52 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs

 15:52 <ddstreet> #subtopic https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+source/memtest86+/+bug/1998834

 15:52 <teward> that's gonna close as soon as it goes through

 15:52 <ddstreet> this is done, i sponsored and per teward's prereview approved

 15:52 <teward> (sorry i have been quiet)

 15:52 <ddstreet> yep, thanks teward :)

 15:53 <ddstreet> #subtopic https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/2012676

 15:53 <ddstreet> this is newish i think

 15:53 <ddstreet> but looks like it needs a sponsor

 15:53 <mapreri> mhh

 15:53 <ddstreet> so i think nothing for us to do, yet, except maybe subscribe ubuntu-sponsors?

 15:53 <mapreri> tbh, the submitted doesn't look like somebody who would provide the update.

 15:54 <mapreri> so, possibly us asking what they want to do.

 15:54 <ddstreet> i suppose one of us should comment in the bug

 15:55 <mapreri> also, I wonder if we should be careful with nfs-utils?

 15:55 <ddstreet> yeah that as well, jumping major versions seems fairly dangerous to me

 15:56 <mapreri> is there a way for us to involve the server team or somebodyâ€¦?

 15:56 <mapreri> â€¦ should we?

 15:56 <ddstreet> and the b/f versions *are* really old... lp: #1878601

 15:57 <mapreri> and also they mention a bug, that really should be SRUed, if anything

 15:57 <ddstreet> ahasenack handled the updating work, i suppose we should subscribe him to the backport bug for his evaluation

 15:58 <ddstreet> that probably is their best approach, to get that specific bug fixed

 15:58 <ddstreet> if it's possible with the older pkg version

 15:58 <ddstreet> we are almost at time - mapreri do you want to follow up in the bug?

 15:58 <ddstreet> or teward?

 15:59 <ddstreet> if not i can

 15:59 <mapreri> (btw, I need to run soon)

 15:59 <teward> ddstreet: you can follow up and say this should be SRU'd not backported

 15:59 <mapreri> I can take the follow up

 15:59 <teward> or mapreri can

 15:59 <ddstreet> thnx, will action

 15:59 <teward> in either case if it needs SRU it needs SRU

 15:59 <teward> not backports

 15:59 <ddstreet> #action mapreri follow up in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/2012676

 15:59 * meetingology mapreri follow up in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/2012676

 15:59 <ddstreet> ok no more bugs

 15:59 <ddstreet> #topic aob

 15:59 <ddstreet> anything else?

 15:59 <mapreri> none from me

 16:00 <ddstreet> #subtopic next mtg date

 16:00 <ddstreet> 4 weeks would be may 10, that work for everyone?

 16:00 <ddstreet> i'll assume yes, since we're at time

 16:01 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet schedule next mtg may 10 same time
