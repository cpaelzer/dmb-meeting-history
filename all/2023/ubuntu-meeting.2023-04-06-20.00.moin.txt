 20:00 <Bashing-om> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board - 06 April 202

 20:00 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:00:13 UTC.  The chair is Bashing-om.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:00 <Bashing-om> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for April 6, 2023. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:00 <Bashing-om> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:00 <Bashing-om> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:01 <Bashing-om> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:01 <Bashing-om> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:01 <Bashing-om> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:01 <Bashing-om> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:01 <Bashing-om> --------------

 20:02 <Kilos> jpnurmi  your up

 20:02 <Bashing-om> And now the floor is open to the board to ask jpnurmi any questions.

 20:02 <jpnurmi> hi all! first of all, here's a link to my membership application: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/j-p-nurmi-membership-application/34212

 20:03 <jpnurmi> my most significant ubuntu contribution is the new ubuntu desktop installer which i've been working on for a couple of years: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-installer

 20:05 <jpnurmi> i'm also active in the ubuntu flutter community. here are some examples:

 20:05 <jpnurmi> https://hilla.kapsi.fi:40058/file/1/APcwMH0mw1QW6hTF

 20:06 <jpnurmi> oops, what did this client do :D

 20:06 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi: Links please to your WIKI/Discourse and launchpad pages for our edification of your deserts :D

 20:07 <jpnurmi> we use github for all ubuntu flutter and dart projects to engage with the greater flutter and dart communities. well, that's also how i found my way here, basically :)

 20:07 <jpnurmi> therefore there's not much activity to see on my LP account but notice that i've been a proud member since 2006: https://launchpad.net/~jpnurmi

 20:08 <Guest9100> jpnurmi, you list contributions beginning the first of March do you hve contributions going back at least six months?

 20:09 <jpnurmi> I've been actively working on the new ubuntu desktop installer since March 2021: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-installer/graphs/contributors

 20:09 <jpnurmi> I joined Canonical in July 2021 to work in the Desktop Installer full time

 20:10 <jpnurmi> s/in/on/

 20:11 <Guest9100> Awesome contributions

 20:11 <jpnurmi> it's been busy times now with the new installer going live in 23.04 :)

 20:14 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi: Wonderful contributions, no doubt. Obligiatory: You signed the Code Of Conduct so many years aga - do you rememeber what you signed then ?

 20:15 <Kilos> lol

 20:15 <jpnurmi> probably not to the finest detail :D

 20:17 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi: ^ Them do you now affirm that you do abide by the terms as set forth in the CoC, and will continue to abide for all the duration of your association with Ubuntu ?

 20:19 <jpnurmi> yes! :)

 20:19 <jpnurmi> i promise to refresh my mind and read through the CoC as well

 20:20 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi's testomonials speak well - I have no other questions --- any others before I call for the vote ?

 20:20 <Kilos> nope

 20:21 <Guest9100> no questions

 20:24 <Kilos> cool beans. Thanks for chairing Bashing-om

 20:24 <Kilos> jpnurmi  welcome aboard

 20:24 <jpnurmi> thank you!

 20:25 <Guest9100> Congratulations

 20:26 <Bashing-om> Congratulations jpnurmi aas a new member. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/ .

 20:27 <Bashing-om> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them!

 20:29 <jpnurmi> thanks! does the @ubuntu.com email address redirect to my primary LP email?

 20:29 <Kilos> mine does

 20:30 <jpnurmi> all good, i found some instructions https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuEmail

 20:30 <Kilos> cool

 20:31 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi: Bear in mind if Google is your Mail source - Google's 2Fa throws a wrench onto the works :(

 20:32 <Kilos> sadly yes

 20:33 <jpnurmi> oh, thanks for the heads up

 20:34 <jpnurmi> alright, it's getting late here. this proud new member is heading out. thanks again and see you around!

 20:35 <Kilos> ty rest well

 20:35 <Bashing-om> jpnurmi: Is on IS's radar to come up with a solution to allow us to post from Google mail as an Ubuntu Memeber.

 20:43 <arraybolt3> (for the record sending stuff from GMail using the ubuntu.com address works just fine if you have 2FA set up on your account - I purchased a pair of Yubikey Security Keys for that, works great :D)

 20:43 <arraybolt3> jpnurmi: ^

 20:43 <Bashing-om> Guest9100: still here ?

 20:44 <Bashing-om> arraybolt3: At some point I will have to inquire of you about that Yubikey Security Key process :D

 20:46 <arraybolt3> (The cheap blue keys work for that just fine - there are also black Yubikeys that have more features and are quite a bit pricier, but I didn't need one of those.)

 20:47 <arraybolt3> Bashing-om: Maybe I should edit the Ubuntu Wiki page on it so that everyone can use it?

 20:48 <arraybolt3> (Probably can't do that today, but at some point.)

 20:59 <Bashing-om> arraybolt3: Making a global procedure to enable us to use our Google Mail would be great for the community, Yes !

 21:13 <Bashing-om> #endmeeting
