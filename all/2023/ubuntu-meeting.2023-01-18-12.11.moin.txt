 12:11 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:11 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:11:55 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:11 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:12 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 18th January 2023. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:12 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:12 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:12 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:12 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:12 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:12 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:12 <diddledani> #topic Aaron Whitehouse

 12:12 <aaron-whitehouse> Would you like me to introduce myself?

 12:12 <Kilos-> yes please

 12:12 <diddledani> Hi @aaron-whitehouse , could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written script (if you prepared one), and share your wiki and launchpad links

 12:13 <Kilos-> lol sorry diddledani

 12:13 <diddledani> :-p

 12:13 <diddledani> it's all good

 12:13 <aaron-whitehouse> I have been an Ubuntu fan and contributor since 2005 and signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct back in 2006. My initial contributions (between 2005 and 2010, particularly) were focused on testing Ubuntu and reporting bugs. My recent contributions have been focused on making Ubuntu as good as it can be on the Public Clouds and producing guidance for

 12:13 <aaron-whitehouse> Ubuntu users.

 12:13 <aaron-whitehouse> My discourse post was here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/aaron-whitehouse-membership-application/33084

 12:13 <aaron-whitehouse> And my wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/aaron-whitehouse

 12:14 <aaron-whitehouse> I would be happy to expand on any points or answer any questions.

 12:15 <diddledani> Thank you, I will let the board have a browse through your links and ask any questions they have

 12:16 <fenris> based on @aaron wiki and testimonial , i cant ask more :)

 12:17 <diddledani> now this is a really solid application :-) I love to see lots of influential people endorsing you

 12:18 <mapreri> yes, the endorsements are very nice, thank you for collecting them!
