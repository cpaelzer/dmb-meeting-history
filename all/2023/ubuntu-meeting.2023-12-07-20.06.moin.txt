 20:06 <lucyllewy> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 20:06 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:06:14 UTC.  The chair is lucyllewy.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:06 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:06 <lucyllewy> #chair lucyllewy

 20:06 <meetingology> Current chairs: lucyllewy

 20:06 <mIk3_08> hi Bashing-om

 20:06 <lucyllewy> here comes a big paste:

 20:06 <lucyllewy> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 7th December 2023 (20:00). The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:06 <lucyllewy> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:06 <lucyllewy> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:06 <lucyllewy> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:06 <lucyllewy> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:06 <lucyllewy> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:06 <lucyllewy> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:07 <lucyllewy> #topic Aaron Prisk

 20:07 <lucyllewy> first up we've for aaronprisk

 20:08 <mIk3_08> @aaronprisk is scheduled 15 i Thuink

 20:08 <mIk3_08> think

 20:08 <lucyllewy> aaronprisk: can you introduce yourself to the board and share the links to your wiki/discourse application and your launchpad

 20:09 <tsimonq2> mIk3_08: Nope, agenda officially says today. You're looking at the date added. :)

 20:09 <aaronprisk> Hello all! :) My name is Aaron Prisk, I am a Community Engineer at Canonical. Prior to my time there I worked in public education for 12 years. Here is my application: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/aaron-prisk-membership-application/40246

 20:10 <mIk3_08> tsimonq2 ah i see... am i schedule today? Date added? Dec 15?

 20:10 <lucyllewy> for the record aaronprisk 's LP page: https://launchpad.net/~aaronprisk

 20:10 <mIk3_08> Today is Dec. 7

 20:11 <mIk3_08> How come? tsimonq2

 20:11 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: please leave the floor until your turn

 20:11 <mIk3_08> @lucyllewy okay. Thanks

 20:12 <lucyllewy> you are scheduled for today after the others

 20:12 <mapreri> (if there is still enough time after the others)

 20:13 <lucyllewy> Now the board members have had a chance to read through, I will open the floor for questions and ask the first one that we must ask every applicant:

 20:13 <lucyllewy> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 20:13 <aaronprisk> Yes

 20:13 <lucyllewy> coolbeans. I didn't expect anything less from someone on the community team :P

 20:14 <lucyllewy> ok, if any board members have any questions for Aaron the time to ask is now :-)

 20:14 <aaronprisk> We are swift to kick out the imposters from the team :)

 20:14 <Bashing-om> no questions

 20:15 <mapreri> I have one question: I appreciate (A LOT! - it's clear you've done much more to me in that field u.u) your effort to spread FOSS to the wider world.  However do you have any example of contributions you've done to the Ubuntu community specifically before your time at Canonical?

 20:16 * mapreri is being mean  }:->

 20:16 <lucyllewy> hah. I just saw that Eickmeyer has put a last minute testimonial on the thread 4 minutes ago :p

 20:17 * Eickmeyer giggles

 20:18 <lucyllewy> aaronprisk: did you see mapreri 's question?

 20:18 <aaronprisk> I would say most of the work to the community prior to Canonical would have taken the form of advocacy and some support. In my efforts with some non-profit orgs here in the US and Canada we've managed to introduce about 15 thousand students to Ubuntu which I hope in time leads to a host of new users, contributors and future members.

 20:18 <lucyllewy> aah

 20:19 <lucyllewy> I jumped the gun :P

 20:19 <mapreri> aaronprisk: ACK, thank you for the clarification.

 20:19 <aaronprisk> Sorry I was checking for any glaring typos haha

 20:19 <lucyllewy> any more questions?

 20:20 <mapreri> aaronprisk: worry not, everybody in the channel is equipped with typo-fixing eyes :P

 20:20 <lucyllewy> if not, then if there is anyone present who'd like to provide an in-person testimonial then you may do so now

 20:20 <arraybolt3> o/

 20:20 <lucyllewy> arraybolt3: if you have a testimonial then you may type it now

 20:21 * tsimonq2 watches as arraybolt3 panics and chuckles

 20:21 <arraybolt3> The times I've worked with Aaron Prisk aren't many, but I've worked with him to fix a severe issue with the Ubuntu Wiki once (someone tried to use it as a password manager). He was very responsive, helpful, and got the issue taken care of quickly. He's also assisted me with other tasks related to Ubuntu infra, which I am very thankful for.

 20:22 <lucyllewy> ooh, ubuntu wiki password manager... why didn't I think of that?! :P

 20:22 <lucyllewy> ok, if we're all good then I'll move onto the vote

 20:22 <lucyllewy> #vote Aaron Prisk's application for Membership

 20:24 <lucyllewy> #topic Mauro Gaspari

 20:24 <aaronprisk> Thank you all so much! For the votes and for the incredibly kind testimonials that you all left. This is a phenomenal community and I’m very honored :)

 20:24 <tsimonq2> aaronprisk: Just keep doing what you're doing <3

 20:24 <mIk3_08> Congratz aaronprisk

 20:25 <lucyllewy> ilvipero: can you introduce yourself to the board and share your links to your application and LP profile

 20:25 <lucyllewy> aaronprisk: the testimonials were epic

 20:25 <ilvipero> Hello, my name is Mauro, but most people call me vipero, including my parents. I am Italian, I live in Switzerland and I have been an incurable Debian and Ubuntu fanboy since what feels to be forever. I always refrained from applying for membershp because I am usually more focused on what I can do than what I can take. But at this point I think applying for membership means being able to contribute even more to the Ubuntu project. So here I am.

 20:25 <ilvipero> Disclaimer, I now work for Canonical in the community team.

 20:25 <ilvipero> This is the link to my application: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mauro-gaspari-membership-application/40249

 20:25 <ilvipero> This is the link to my launchpad:  https://launchpad.net/~ilvipero

 20:25 <mapreri> aaronprisk: those (like ilvipero's) were impressive testimonials.  Nowadays people comes to the meeting with very very few testimonials alas…

 20:26 <lucyllewy> While the board members check out your links and statement I'll ask the first question:

 20:26 <lucyllewy> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 20:26 <ilvipero> Yes

 20:26 <lucyllewy> awesome

 20:26 <lucyllewy> I didn't expect anything less :-)

 20:27 <lucyllewy> ok, board members, start your engines ^H^H^H I mean ask your questions

 20:27 * mapreri is happy

 20:27 <lucyllewy> awesome

 20:27 <tsimonq2> I'm not on the UMB, but could you explain your Launchpad karma? (In full support.)

 20:27 <lucyllewy> Bashing-om ?

 20:28 * tsimonq2 gets to be mean this time ;)

 20:28 * lucyllewy bops tsimonq2 on the noggin :P

 20:28 <arraybolt3> *slaps tsimonq2 with a wet fish and then vanishes before causing too much disruption*

 20:28 <ilvipero> 4 is the perfect number!

 20:28 <lucyllewy> ilvipero: it's missing the 2 on the right-hand end :P

 20:29 <tsimonq2> That's it, ilvipero can't get membership until his karma is exactly 42. :P

 20:29 <ilvipero> I have not been super active on Launchpad but more on other platforms, such as writing documentation or helping flavours

 20:29 <lucyllewy> hah

 20:29 <Bashing-om> lucyllewy: I frequent Discourse daily - have seen ilvipero's impresive credentials:)

 20:29 <ilvipero> I should have reached 42 then asked for it to be frozen forever. I still can do that though

 20:29 <lucyllewy> the testimonials are awesome epic amazeballs again

 20:30 <lucyllewy> does anyone want to provide an in-person testimonial?

 20:30 * Eickmeyer adds last minute testimonial again 💀

 20:30 <Eickmeyer> j/k

 20:30 <tsimonq2> Eickmeyer: Hey, while you're at it, add one for leokolb too ;P

 20:30 <lucyllewy> ok, I can move onto the vote then....

 20:30 <aaronprisk> If I may say one thing as the biased community team comrade of Mauro: I have spent countless hours with Mauro over the past year and he is an infinite well of energy and enthusiasm. He loves this community and exemplifies what has made it so great for so long.

 20:31 <lucyllewy> <3 thank you aaronprisk

 20:31 <lucyllewy> #vote Mauro's application for Membership

 20:31 <meetingology> Please vote on: Mauro's application for Membership

 20:31 <lucyllewy> ok. shoot your voting guns

 20:31 <mapreri> fwiw, I can also endorse ilvipero based on my personal interactions with him over the past year, correlated with the italy loco :)

 20:32 <lucyllewy> again, I believe Kilos is +1

 20:32 <aaronprisk> Woooo!

 20:33 <lucyllewy> we are now moving at 2 miles per hour!

 20:33 <mIk3_08> biased community @aaronprisk :-D

 20:33 <tsimonq2> 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

 20:33 <lucyllewy> #topic Leó Kolbeinsson

 20:33 <lucyllewy> leokolb: can you introduce yourself to the board and share your links to your application and LP profile

 20:33 <Eickmeyer> 🥳

 20:34 <leokolb> Hello all – my name is Leó Kolbeinsson and am a Network and Security consultant in Iceland and have been involved with daily ISO testing of Ubuntu (server/desktop/WSL/RaspPi) and other flavors for the past 6 and half years. In the past I was a Lubuntu member and Lubuntu Council member but have expanded my interest to all flavors. As stated in my

 20:34 <leokolb> application I wish to continue to help Ubuntu and flavors to maintain their high quality.

 20:34 <leokolb> My application link : https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/leo-kolbeinsson-membership-application/40335/11

 20:34 <leokolb> launchpad link: https://launchpad.net/~leok

 20:35 <lucyllewy> and again while the board reviews your posts I'll ask the important question:

 20:35 <lucyllewy> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 20:35 <leokolb> yes

 20:36 <tsimonq2> Remember in my endorsement when I said Leó often brings items up to the attention of myself and other Lubuntu Developers that are incredibly important? Well, to my recollection he's done that *twice* since I endorsed him not long ago. The UMB should absolutely make leokolb a member. As part of the team who originally granted him Lubuntu Membership, he really does deserve Ubuntu Membership, full

 20:36 <tsimonq2> stop.

 20:36 <tsimonq2> arraybolt3: Do you have anything to add on this front specifically? ^

 20:36 * guiverc whispers Leo has also done some beyond just our Lubuntu project/team

 20:36 <arraybolt3> I think I'll let the QA tracker be its own testimonial. https://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/reports/testers

 20:37 <lucyllewy> thank you tsimonq2 <3 that's a powerful extra statement :-)

 20:37 <tsimonq2> My endorsement here does not override my existing endorsement, it simply compliments it. :)

 20:37 <arraybolt3> He holds the Jammy Daily testing record and beats #2 by over 1000 tests, he currently holds the Noble testing record, and he also holds the all-time testing record. No one tests our ISOs as much as he does, quite literally.

 20:37 <lucyllewy> wowoweewah!

 20:38 <lucyllewy> that's testy testing!

 20:38 <aaronprisk> Leok has been a prolific tester and his efforts have helped ensure that our releases are stable and trusted by the millions of users around the world. We need more Leok’s in this community :)

 20:38 <mapreri> This is a case where the endorsements were really a deal breaker for me, as just looking at launchpad and discourse page (no wiki homepage?) really wasn't clear what you are doing

 20:38 <tsimonq2> I remember back as a young whipper snapper when I was near (or at) #1 on that list. It takes a looooooooooot of hard work. A lot of people don't realize it.

 20:38 <tsimonq2> aaronprisk: Strong +1.

 20:38 <mapreri> with those endorsement, I really have nothing more to say ^^

 20:38 <lucyllewy> any questions, Bashing-om ?

 20:39 <lucyllewy> I'm pretty happy with everything I can see that I have no questions myself

 20:39 <lucyllewy> again. good testimonials are key.

 20:39 <Bashing-om> no questions ^ speaks Broadly :)

 20:39 <Eickmeyer> With my lead hat for Ubuntu Studio and my proxy for Edubuntu hats on, I agree with everything tsimonq2, aaronprisk, arraybolt3, and guiverc have said.

 20:39 <lucyllewy> wonderful. I guess we can get to the voting then

 20:40 * mapreri thinks we need to standardize on testimonials/endorsements/advocacies/…?

 20:40 <lucyllewy> we're powering through here!

 20:40 <lucyllewy> agreed. I really need to see testimonials.

 20:40 <mIk3_08> good testimonials are key and the biased thing. :-D

 20:40 <tsimonq2> mapreri: Why should you? It's not RFC-2119 ;)

 20:40 <tsimonq2> *shrug*

 20:43 <tsimonq2> leokolb: You really should be, keep up your amazing work. 🎉🎉🎉🎉

 20:43 <mIk3_08> lucyllewy yes?

 20:43 <arraybolt3> leokolb: You've done so much, I would be mad if you had gotten turned down just now. :)

 20:43 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: can you introduce yourself and share the links to your application and LP profile

 20:44 <mIk3_08> Hi I am Michael Quisido

 20:44 <mIk3_08> And I am applying for Ubuntu Membership

 20:44 <mIk3_08> I dont have any testi here.

 20:44 <mIk3_08> Just a plain applicant.

 20:44 <mIk3_08> Does my loyalty is not a credit to you guys?

 20:44 <lucyllewy> For the record, mIk3_08 's links are https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/michael-quisido-iii-membership-application/40834 and https://launchpad.net/~mike-quisido

 20:45 <lucyllewy> while the board reviews your links I will ask the first question:

 20:45 <lucyllewy> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be grante

 20:47 <mapreri> he also has a wiki page, fwiw: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mike-quisido

 20:47 <lucyllewy> thank you, mapreri

 20:47 <mIk3_08> Thanks @mapreri

 20:49 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: did you see my question above?

 20:49 <mIk3_08> @lucyllewy yes

 20:50 <lucyllewy> can you clarify that you are stating that you have read and understood the terms of the code of conduct? with a simple yes there it could be read that you are saying yes you saw the question, not that you are answering yes to the question itself.

 20:50 <mapreri> Personally, I don't think I see enough _sustained_ contributions, and coupled with the lack of testimonials this makes my approval quite hard to get.

 20:52 <mIk3_08> testimonials are key and the biased thing. @mapreri

 20:53 <arraybolt3> Testimonials means that you've done things that directly improved the Ubuntu operating system for all users and people saw it. It's hard to verify that you've done something if people can't see it. That's why they're important.

 20:53 <arraybolt3> (me vanishes since this is just my opinion, I'm not on the UMB)

 20:53 <mIk3_08> @ lucyllewy, Yes. I have understand and signed the code of conduct

 20:54 <lucyllewy> cool. thank you.

 20:54 <Bashing-om> mIk3_08: The testimonials serve to prove you are not blowing smoke and that you have the approval of peers.

 20:54 <aaronprisk> mIk3_08 has been working to revive the Ubuntu Philippines LoCo. I look forward to seeing the great work that comes out of that effort. :)

 20:55 <mIk3_08> I will try my best @aaronprisk

 20:55 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: I see you have mentioned two websites in your application. One of them doesn't have anything hosted on it, and the other is a redirect to Ubuntu.com. Can you clarify the contributions you have provided with these two domains as they form the bulk of your listed contributions in your application post under the heading "My Contributions"?

 20:56 <Bashing-om> mIk3_08: We can see tht you were active in 2018 - I see little else since . You have joined a lot of teams - what contributions have you made to the various teams ?

 20:56 <mIk3_08> To gather people in philippines @aaronprisk

 20:56 <lucyllewy> thanks, aaronprisk . Have you interacted with mIk3_08 before?

 20:57 <aaronprisk> A few times, mostly around the effort to revive that local community team. I appreciate his willingness and enthusiasm to take that effort on.

 20:57 <lucyllewy> cool. thank you.

 20:57 <mIk3_08> @Bashing-om That was before. I try not to renew but It automatically newed itself.

 20:58 <mIk3_08> i mean renewed

 20:58 <lucyllewy> we're nearing the hour mark on the meeting which is normally the cut-off. I can keep going if everyone is ok to do so

 20:58 <mIk3_08> Thanks for the trust @aaronprisk

 20:59 <mIk3_08> No.. just now. @lucyllewy

 20:59 <Bashing-om> mIk3_08: We look for "sustained contributions" as one determining factor in awarding membership. Please show us what you have done recently in sustainability !

 20:59 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: I'm not sure what you mean in response to Bashing-om 's question that "that was before". Can you say more about that?

 21:00 <mapreri> I'm fine staying longer…

 21:00 <lucyllewy> we're specifically looking for sustained and significant contributions, and we like to see activity in the past 6 months.

 21:01 <mIk3_08> In launchpad.. @lucyllewy... Bashing-om is referring to my group in launchpad... I try not to renew those groups but it automatically renewed itself.

 21:03 <mIk3_08> @lucyllewy as of now I hold the ubuntu.com.ph to gather people here in Philippines. Its not easy to work alone.

 21:04 <mIk3_08> What you think? @lucyllewy

 21:04 <mIk3_08> Thanks @mapreri

 21:05 <mapreri> mIk3_08: meaning you are "alone" for now in -ph in this effort? :(

 21:05 <lucyllewy> mIk3_08: do you have any other contributions in the past 6 months that we can see beyond the ubuntu.com.ph domain name ownership?

 21:05 <mIk3_08> Yes! I am @mapreri

 21:06 <mIk3_08> @ I am active in https://ubuntuforums.org/ since from the start

 21:06 <mIk3_08> Bashing-om knows that.

 21:07 <mIk3_08> @lucyllewy I am active in https://ubuntuforums.org/ since from the start

 21:07 <mapreri> please link your ubuntuforumes profile in your wiki/lp/application if it is relevant for us…

 21:07 <mIk3_08> @mapreri sec...

 21:08 <mapreri> https://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=2079368 ?

 21:08 <Bashing-om> mIk3_08: I can attest that you are active on the Forums - however more as supportive than making a contribution to resolve problems.

 21:08 <mIk3_08> https://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=2079368

 21:08 <mapreri> either way, I think I'm ready to vote myself.

 21:14 <meetingology> -1 what ifs, maybes and good wishes are not contributions. received from Bashing-om

 21:15 <lucyllewy> -1 I'm afraid I don't yet see enough recent contributions that show a signification and sustained activity.

 21:15 <meetingology> -1 I'm afraid I don't yet see enough recent contributions that show a signification and sustained activity. received from lucyllewy

 21:15 <mapreri> -1 - not enough significant and sustained contributions to the community; though now I found many posts in the forums, no time to look at them but otoh Bashing-om says they are not so much.

 21:15 <meetingology> Motion denied

 21:15 <mapreri> I don't think Kilos actually voted on that

 21:15 <mapreri> anyway…

 21:16 <mapreri> he did say to recommend you to get endorsements, however :)

 21:16 <lucyllewy> I'm sorry you didn't make it this time, mIk3_08 . Please don't be dissuaded, but do consider coming back again if you can show more significant, sustained, and recent contributions. Even better if you can get a testimonial or several as they really help us in our decision making.

 21:18 <mIk3_08> @ mapreri :-D

 21:20 <lucyllewy> thank you everyone for attending.

 21:20 <lucyllewy> Congratulations to all the new members. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/ (1/2)

 21:20 <lucyllewy> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them! (2/2)

 21:20 <tsimonq2> Everyone should subscribe to LWN. ;)

 21:20 <lucyllewy> with that I'll end the meeting
