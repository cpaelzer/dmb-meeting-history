 14:32 <slyon> python-jsonschema seems new, and needs to be looked at by the openstack team (cc jamespage)

 14:33 <slyon> other than that, I cannot spot anything new, compared to last week

 14:33 <sarnold> good morning

 14:34 <slyon> python-reportlab is about to be demoted this cycle. rustc + cargo hopefully to be re-promoted soon.

 14:34 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <didrocks> is it because we are just before the FF storm?

 14:35 <sarnold> didrocks: probably :)

 14:35 <eslerm> :D

 14:35 <slyon> yeah, probably people are busy with landing their latest features (so am I :-P)

 14:36 <slyon> no open questions since last week. Status of the most recent bug reports seems correct.

 14:36 <slyon> seb128: I reviewed your https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libbytesize/ today (MIR ACK)

 14:37 <slyon> lvoytek: I checked your fixes on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lua5.4/+bug/2026608 today (MIR ACK)

 14:37 <slyon> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:37 <slyon> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:37 <slyon> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:37 <slyon> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:39 <slyon> There was some discussion at the sprint last week about #30/#31. I'll keep that open for c_paelzer to put the final conclusion

 14:39 <slyon> #33 has some open remarks to be resolved

 14:39 <slyon> I don't see any new comments, so I think it's mostly on c_paelzer to finalize and merge those PRs.

 14:40 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:40 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:40 <eslerm> security reviewed our MIR log for feature freeze

 14:40 <eslerm> dotnet6 was assigned

 14:40 <eslerm> we will complete dasbus between FF and release (checked with affected team)

 14:40 <eslerm> I am taking libde265 after FF

 14:40 <eslerm> fdk-aac *could* be worked on if the repackaging block is expected to be resolved before Mantic's release

 14:40 <dviererbe> \0/

 14:40 <eslerm> :D

 14:41 <slyon> jbicha: see question about fdc-aac above ^ (bug #1977614)

 14:41 <sarnold> once we see what the FF storm brings, we might be in a different place, but for right now it feels like we're in an okay position

 14:42 <slyon> eslerm: any news on rustc/cargo? liushuyu-011 was asking for that

 14:42 <eslerm> there is progress, but I don't know the specifics

 14:42 <eslerm> if it is not finished by next meeting, I'll have an eta

 14:43 <slyon> thanks!

 14:43 <slyon> I might ask liushuyu-011 to check back with Paolo directly on a quick status update.

 14:43 <eslerm> ^

 14:43 <eslerm> we weren't too concerned about completing it by FF

 14:44 <slyon> thanks for the update eslerm & sarnold

 14:44 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 14:44 <dviererbe> I'm not around for the next 2 weeks, so you have one spectator less ^^

 14:44 <sarnold> dviererbe: enjoy :)

 14:44 <slyon> enjoy your time off

 14:45 <dviererbe> thx

 14:45 <sarnold> I thought I had something yesterday but now I can't recall :(

 14:45 <eslerm> none from me

 14:45 <slyon> sarnold: you can always create a GitHub issue once it pops up in your head again. So it won't be lost for next meeting

 14:46 <slyon> If nothing else, well keep this brief and I'll close the meeting.

 14:46 <slyon> Thanks all!

 14:46 <eslerm> thanks for hosting slyon
