 14:31 <cpaelzer> the old jaraco that we know for openstack

 14:31 <slyon> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> not more yet for https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/noble

 14:31 <sarnold> good morning

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:31 <didrocks> o/ (I’m exceptionnally here this week)

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:31 <cpaelzer> happy, I hope that means no sick-at-home being the reason didrocks

 14:32 <cpaelzer> we have a bunch (much less than expected due to massaging dependencies and function) perl items that need review

 14:32 <cpaelzer> 5 of them are waiting for a reviewer

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I need TBH that I can not take any before the sprint

 14:33 <cpaelzer> is any of you having enough capacity to take one for this or next week?

 14:33 <didrocks> I can take a second one (I couldn’t due to the sprint and final rush do the one I had previous one) and do it before EOW

 14:33 <slyon> I can take one

 14:33 <didrocks> next week, I don’t want to commit with the sprint

 14:33 <slyon> There's a list of priorities for those MIRs in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmail-dmarc-perl/+bug/2023971/comments/11

 14:34 <cpaelzer> of those https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libregexp-common-perl/+bug/2039563 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libnet-ip-perl/+bug/2039456 are already assigned

 14:35 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libnet-idn-encode-perl/+bug/2038929 has been reviewed and back on miriam until action has been taken

 14:35 <cpaelzer> let us distribute a few more as we have capacity

 14:35 <cpaelzer> slyon: didrocks: could you just pick one each from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir ?

 14:35 <slyon> So let me take libfile-sharedir-perl ?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> sure

 14:36 * slyon assigned himself

 14:36 <didrocks> I will take libemail-abstract-perl

 14:36 <slyon> didrocks: that's one of the lower priority ones..

 14:36 <didrocks> abstract and perl in the same package name, what could go wrong? :)

 14:36 <didrocks> ah

 14:36 <cpaelzer> in terms of prio according to the post would be better https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libclass-inspector-perl/+bug/2039569

 14:36 <didrocks> I got the list the other way around

 14:36 <didrocks> good to me, picking that one

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok, we'll slowly churn through all of those

 14:36 <didrocks> if I can stay away from any abstraction, that’s a bonus (somewhat :p)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> and let us just be happy it seems there won't be ~50 of them

 14:37 <didrocks> until debian sync starts, we’ll see…

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ok, going on ...

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:40 <slyon> I think there's nothing actionable here

 14:40 <slyon> the libnet-idn-encode-perl MIR might be dropped by changing to another dependency, which is already in main

 14:40 <cpaelzer> agreed

 14:40 <didrocks> agreed

 14:40 <cpaelzer> leaving the check of that to miriam

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:41 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:41 <cpaelzer> the renovate auto branch is handled

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we can close #38

 14:41 <slyon> +1

 14:42 <cpaelzer> all the others are long term cases waiting for the right time

 14:42 <cpaelzer> nothing to act

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: seeing https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libemail-simple-perl/+bug/2031491 in there

 14:43 <eslerm> not much news, we've been discussing perl fuzzing and Andrei is writing documentation tips

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: was my explanation of not being a dup enough that we mark it new?

 14:44 <eslerm> this work will begin after the sprint, we'll likely have several dedicated people involved

 14:44 <eslerm> a deadline by NN has been agreed to with Miriam

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks eslerm

 14:45 * slyon reading context on libemail-simple-perl

 14:46 <slyon> Okay. I requested a differentiation of the two stacks. You came to the conclusion that they should be considered non-duplicates.

 14:46 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:46 <slyon> So having that in the security queue seems correct. right?

 14:46 <cpaelzer> it is like mutt and thunderbird :-) but for perl

 14:47 <slyon> ACK. wfm

 14:47 <cpaelzer> thanks, I updated the case

 14:47 <slyon> But I guess we still need security ACK for the other/new stack

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:47 <sarnold> ha :)

 14:47 <cpaelzer> yes we still need security, it is only back to "new" not to and "final and done" state

 14:48 <sarnold> my apologies for not getting the scheduling survey done :( it's been busy that it's always fallen out of my mental todo list

 14:48 <didrocks> you are not the only one :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> exactly

 14:48 <eslerm> it would be nice to meet up during the sprint

 14:48 <didrocks> but yeah, would be great to settle that for post-sprint

 14:48 <sarnold> and i'll send my apologies for next week

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ha eslerm, that was just what I wanted to ask

 14:48 <eslerm> :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> should I schedule something in Riga engineering week?

 14:49 <cpaelzer> give me an agenda item or two worth to see you over more than just a beer at a bar :-)

 14:49 <sarnold> I'd very much like us all to get together and have it be scheduled so that we don't wind up with yet another sprint with only half of us getting together

 14:49 <slyon> Yes, please. Maybe we can just use the usual MIR meeting slot, as we've done in the past?

 14:49 <didrocks> I think it’s been quite some time we haven’t done that, it would be great, but quick, the calendars are filing up quite fast :p

 14:49 <didrocks> as long as it’s booked to not be double booked, I’m fine

 14:50 <sarnold> yes :( so much double and triple-booking :(

 14:50 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:50 <cpaelzer> let me have a look right now ...

 14:50 <didrocks> but the MIR meeting slot is already booked for me in my case :/

 14:51 <cpaelzer> them original slot is gone for me too

 14:52 <cpaelzer> friday after lunch or before lightning talks is available to all of us

 14:53 <eslerm> after lunch sounds nice, in case people wanted to meet for lunch as well

 14:53 <cpaelzer> yep

 14:53 <didrocks> sounds good to me :)

 14:53 <slyon> wfm

 14:54 <cpaelzer> sent

 14:54 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:54 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:54 <sarnold> thanks! \o/

 14:54 <sarnold> nothing else from me

 14:55 <cpaelzer> neither from me

 14:55 <didrocks> thanks!

 14:55 <slyon> nothing

 14:55 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:55 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 14:55 <cpaelzer> next week some of us will be at the planning sprint already

 14:55 <cpaelzer> might be rather silent here

 14:55 <cpaelzer> whoever is left can lead the lonely meeting then

 14:55 <cpaelzer> bye

 14:55 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
