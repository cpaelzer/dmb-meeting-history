 16:05 <ddstreet> ah sorry that did see some work didn't it

 16:06 <mapreri> I think this is actually done?  Probably need a check, and I'm aware of one bug in backportpacakge (uses the wrong -v value for dpkg-gencahgnes)

 16:06 <ddstreet> #undo

 16:06 <meetingology> Removing item from minutes: ACTION

 16:06 <mapreri> my right hand is quicker than my left hand today, looking at those typos :3

 16:06 <ddstreet> so we should just add an action for someone to verify that then right?

 16:06 <mapreri> imho yep

 16:06 <teward> i'm here

 16:06 <mapreri> hey teward !

 16:07 <teward> assign what lol

 16:07 <mapreri> ahah

 16:07 <ddstreet> we think the tooling (backportpackage, etc) has been updated, just need one of us to verify it's good, you want to take that?

 16:08 <mapreri> [01 05:05:59 PM] <mapreri> […]I'm aware of one bug in backportpacakge (uses the wrong -v value for dpkg-gencahgnes)

 16:08 <teward> yeah i'll take verification ,just send me the list of what all in the tooling needs verified/tested

 16:08 <teward> because without the list i'm going to not be 100% accurate

 16:08 <mapreri> well…

 16:09 <teward> *is running on 75% mental capacity after migraines all day yesterday*

 16:09 <luna> can relate to migranes :(

 16:09 <mapreri> I'd just want to say "make sure there are NO bugs" :P

 16:09 <teward> ;P

 16:10 <teward> mapreri: "backportpackage, etc." is vague, do you have the full list of tooling?

 16:10 <teward> backportpackage and what else?  (dead)

 16:10 <mapreri> backportpackage and requestbackport, are the two tools

 16:10 <ddstreet> ok so i'll action teward looking at those 2 tools

 16:16 <ddstreet> ack

 16:16 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)

 16:16 <mapreri> otherwise I'm just going to add water to my own drowning self

 16:17 <ddstreet> you want to keep this or just let it drop?

 16:17 <mapreri> pls keep it

 16:17 <ddstreet> ack

 16:17 <ddstreet> #action mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)

 16:17 * meetingology mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)

 16:17 <luna> (carried over)

 16:17 <ddstreet> ah right, i'll add that to the agenda when i edit it, thanks

 16:17 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri draft response email re: charter to TB

 16:17 <mapreri> well, the TB was quicker than me, so drop this i guess

 16:18 <luna> guess TB in this case is not Thunderbird?

 16:18 <ddstreet> sounds good; if amurray is around, we could discuss it now some

 16:18 <mapreri> luna: technical board

 16:18 <luna> ah

 16:18 <ddstreet> ok that's all the previous items

 16:18 <ddstreet> #topic open mailing list threads

 16:19 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:19 <ddstreet> no movement on this one i think

 16:19 <mapreri> (see above thing about unread mails…)

 16:19 <ddstreet> yep

 16:19 <ddstreet> i'll add an action to reply on this thread just to keep it alive

 16:20 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet reply to no-bug-required backport exception ML thread to keep thread alive

 16:20 * meetingology ddstreet reply to no-bug-required backport exception ML thread to keep thread alive

 16:20 <ddstreet> #subtopic TB mailing list charter email

 16:20 <mapreri> did you have a chance to read my reply from 1h ago?

 16:20 <ddstreet> so i see amurray and mapreri have followed up on this thread

 16:21 <ddstreet> yep, i think we are in agreement

 16:21 <mapreri> I'd like to understand if my opinion is too different from yours

 16:21 <mapreri> opinion*s*

 16:21 <ddstreet> for reference:

 16:21 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2023-March/002713.html

 16:22 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2023-March/002714.html

 16:22 <luna> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023027.html

 16:22 <ddstreet> right thanks, i was linking to TB list

 16:22 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-March/023027.html

 16:23 <ddstreet> mapreri I think your summed-up proposal sounds perfect

 16:24 <ddstreet> teward you have a chance to review the emails?

 16:24 <mapreri> I'll take that as some praise :3

 16:24 <ddstreet> mapreri++ i'd give you karma if we had a karma bot here :)

 16:24 <teward> ddstreet: as they've come in yes, but i haven't had any objections or complaints so my non-voice on the emails can be treated as acceptance without objection

 16:24 <mapreri> having ddstreet claim some propositions are "perfect", duh ^^

 16:24 <teward> so JGTM

 16:24 <teward> LGTM*

 16:24 <teward> ffs keyboard.

 16:24 <Eickmeyer> !cookie | mapreri

 16:24 <ubottu> mapreri: Wow! You're such a great helper, you deserve a cookie!

 16:24 <mapreri> :D

 16:25 <ddstreet> lol nice

 16:25 <luna> read the email now and LGTM

 16:25 <mapreri> ddstreet: technically my irc bouncer then runs pisg on the log, so the ++ does mark it as karma there :P

 16:26 <ddstreet> so i guess we can wait for amurray response on the ML then and continue the discussion there, if needed

 16:26 <luna> +1

 16:26 <mapreri> I think so, yes.

 16:26 <mapreri> although

 16:26 <mapreri> one detail that popped out in my reply, I forgot whether we discussed it already before: do we want to write done a SLA somewhere?

 16:27 <ddstreet> i think it would definitely be helpful - both to us, as well as uploaders

 16:27 <ddstreet> should we figure out one now?

 16:28 <ddstreet> my first though is something like at least 2 weeks, though that (probably) seems long to uploaders

 16:28 <mapreri> that's going to be awkward right now.  please add a note of some kind and let's come back to this later on.  especially perhaps after somebody from TB comments on my mail

 16:28 <ddstreet> personally i only check the upload queue once a week though

 16:28 <ddstreet> sounds good

 16:28 * mapreri mumbles something about Debian's NEW

 16:29 <ddstreet> #action (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 16:29 * meetingology (unassigned) consider documenting an SLA for reviewing uploaded backport packages

 16:29 <ddstreet> what's debian's new?

 16:29 <mapreri> the new queue

 16:29 <luna> ddstreet: newly packages uploaded to ftp.debian i think

 16:29 <mapreri> where new packages pending ftp-master review stay

 16:29 <luna> ah

 16:29 <mapreri> luna: well, you are right :)

 16:30 <ddstreet> doesn't ubuntu queue have that also?

 16:30 <mapreri> yes

 16:30 <mapreri> but Debian's queue doesn't have any expectations

 16:30 <mapreri> there have been packages pending for more than 1 year sometimes

 16:30 <ddstreet> oh wow

 16:30 <mapreri> heh

 16:30 <mapreri> as a contributor you really need to have faith sometimes

 16:30 <ddstreet> though i think some of ubuntu's queue still have old-timers in them as well

 16:31 <ddstreet> yeah, e.g.: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+queue?queue_state=0&queue_text=

 16:31 <mapreri> normally those in ubuntu get stuck because of some reason, however, not because "nobody feels like reviewing this [for many many months]"

 16:31 <ddstreet> poor networking-mlnx, been there for 2.5 years

 16:31 <ddstreet> true

 16:32 <mapreri> anyway, any other topic? :)

 16:32 <ddstreet> i think we're on to open bugs

 16:32 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs needing discussion

 16:32 <ddstreet> i think the only open one is memtest86+

 16:32 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/memtest86+/+bug/1998834

 16:32 <ddstreet> i believe this just needs a sponsor?

 16:33 <mapreri> exactly

 16:33 <mapreri> sigh, I really don't like if the absence of sponsors in this case reflects poorly on us :(

 16:33 <mapreri> but I also don't want to give expectations that we are happy to sponsor whoever comes along :\

 16:34 <mapreri> how vexing.

 16:34 <ddstreet> indeed, though i think that's a more widespread issue than just backports bugs

 16:34 <mapreri> yes, totally

 16:35 <ddstreet> i can volunteer to sponsor this one, though i agree it would be great if ubuntu-sponsors got more active

 16:35 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet sponsor lp: #1998834

 16:35 * meetingology ddstreet sponsor lp: #1998834

 16:35 <mapreri> thank you

 16:35 <ddstreet> yep np

 16:36 <ddstreet> are there any other backport bugs i missed?

 16:36 <mapreri> none afaik

 16:36 <luna> nope

 16:36 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 16:36 <mapreri> I have one AOB.

 16:37 <mapreri> So, unit193 brought to my attention that he accidentally did a gallery-dl bpo to kinetic, whom somebody approved.  Now, I don't think that's problematic per se, although we decided to forbid general bpos to non-LTSs.

 16:38 <teward> wasn't me who poked it, but it might've been someone else

 16:38 <ddstreet> i think i approved that

 16:38 <ddstreet> but did we decide to not approve anything to non-lts?

 16:38 <mapreri> now, in this case I'd just say it's really not something problematic, but this made me wonder if somebody checked whether we have the ability to, say, remove a package from the bpo pocket?

 16:38 <mapreri> ddstreet: we did, yes

 16:38 * ddstreet makes a note of that

 16:38 <ddstreet> sorry :)

 16:39 <mapreri> "Backports to non-LTS are not accepted (with exceptions)." is on our wiki page :)

 16:40 <mapreri> back to my question, do anybody know if that's something that comes from our ACL, or do we need to poke AA in case we ever wants to remove something?

 16:40 <ddstreet> yep

 16:40 <ddstreet> sorry 'yep' was to comment about wiki

 16:40 <ddstreet> re: removal i don't know, but i assume we would need to poke AA

 16:41 <ddstreet> should we see if we can remove the gallery-dl in kinetic?

 16:42 <mapreri> that was my implied question

 16:42 <mapreri> also, how we would even try? :3

 16:42 <ddstreet> i'm not even sure how to do it, probably a cli would be needed

 16:42 <mapreri> should we bother investigating?

 16:42 <ddstreet> i dont see any way looking at the LP web pages

 16:42 <mapreri> or just live happy for now?

 16:42 <mapreri> I'd expect to be some API, at least

 16:43 <ddstreet> yeah i'm sure it's possible with the LP api

 16:43 <ddstreet> since we don't care about non-LTSes, I'd say we can just leave it there

 16:44 <ddstreet> and I will be sure not to look at the non-LTS queues anymore (or just reject stuff in them :-)

 16:44 <mapreri> indeed, let's just forget for now then ^^

 16:44 <mapreri> it's a trivial problem anyway

 16:45 <ddstreet> any other business from anyone? besides next mtg date?

 16:45 <luna> not from me

 16:46 <ddstreet> ok for next mtg, if we're going out 4 weeks as usual, i can't make Mar 29

 16:46 <luna> same

 16:46 <mapreri> let's do 5th apr then?

 16:46 <luna> works for me

 16:46 <ddstreet> i can't do that either, i could do Apr 12?

 16:46 <ddstreet> or i could go earlier, Mar 22?

 16:47 <luna> both 5th and 12th April works for me (22th March does not)

 16:47 <ddstreet> if we want to stick to Wed

 16:47 <mapreri> that *might* be problematic for (I might have some construction workers at home, not sure yet), but otherwise fine for me

 16:47 <ddstreet> should we push to Apr 19?

 16:47 <mapreri> I think we could go with 12th

 16:47 <ddstreet> ok sounds good

 16:47 <mapreri> teward: ? :)

 16:48 <teward> either day works

 16:48 <ddstreet> #ddstreet sched next mtg Apr 12

 16:48 <ddstreet> oops

 16:48 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet sched next mtg Apr 12

 16:48 * meetingology ddstreet sched next mtg Apr 12

 16:48 <mapreri> ddstreet turns into a bot command

 16:49 <mapreri> easier to summon

 16:49 <luna> *notes in my Google calendar*

 16:49 <luna> summer time then right?

 16:49 <ddstreet> lol i would not want to see myself as a bot, i would not be helpful :)

 16:49 <luna> so 17:00 UTC instead of 16 UTC

 16:49 <mapreri> alright, I'll sign off, I have another mtg in another channel in 10 mins /o\

 16:49 <luna> or am i thinking wrong?

 16:49 <mapreri> oh, damn DST

 16:49 <ddstreet> yep we've been using USA DST schedule so it will be DST

 16:50 <mapreri> let me check a thing

 16:50 <luna> 1 hour earlier or later?
