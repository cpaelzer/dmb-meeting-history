 19:01 <rbasak> #startmeeting Developer Membership Board

 19:01 <meetingology> Meeting started at 19:01:41 UTC.  The chair is rbasak.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 19:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 19:02 <rbasak> Let's deal with the action items after our applicant, as the only person who has an action isn't here today anyway.

 19:02 <rbasak> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 19:02 <rbasak> #subtopic Lena Voytek (2023-01-23 @ 19:00 UTC meeting)

 19:03 <rbasak> So lvoytek is a colleague on my team, so my usual approach is to recuse myself unless I'm needed to make quorum after a unanimous +1 vote from everyone else. But now kanashiro[m] and utkarsh21021 are also close colleagues, so that might not be helpful.

 19:03 <rbasak> Let's see how this goes. But I'll still leave the others to do the questioning I guess.

 19:03 <rbasak> I also added an endorsement a few minutes ago.

 19:03 <utkarsh21021> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LenaVoytek/UbuntuServerDeveloperApplication

 19:04 <rbasak> Thanks!

 19:04 <rbasak> lvoytek: would you like to introduce yourself please?

 19:04 <lvoytek> sure thing

 19:04 <lvoytek> Hi all! I am Lena Voytek. I work on the Server Distro team at Canonical, focusing mostly on packages related to mysql, django, and libvirt, alongside various server packages that need fixes or merges. Today I'm applying for upload permissions for the ubuntu-server package set.

 19:04 <utkarsh21021> whilst kanashiro and rbasak are direct colleagues, I am not ;)

 19:05 <rbasak> Any questions for lvoytek please?

 19:06 <kanashiro[m]> I am going to skip the questioning as well, nothing to ask to be honest

 19:06 <sil2100> I see a lot of good endorsements

 19:07 <sil2100> lvoytek: one question, just out of curiosity - did you ever had an upload sponsored by someone outside of your team?

 19:08 <lvoytek> yes, when we created the virtualbmc package in Ubuntu Corey Bryant sponsored: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbmc/2.2.2-0ubuntu3

 19:08 <sil2100> \o/

 19:08 <utkarsh21021> I have sponsored her upload after moving to CPC :P

 19:08 <lvoytek> Since this package ended up going to the openstack team for maintenance

 19:08 <lvoytek> thats true too :)

 19:09 <sil2100> Ah, I keep forgetting the mixture between teams ;p

 19:09 <sil2100> lvoytek: ok, so more of a technical question: I'd like to ask you a bit about SRUs. What can you tell me about what an SRU needs additionally, besides what's needed for a regular devel series upload?

 19:09 <seb128> hey, sorry I got delayed

 19:10 <utkarsh21021> seb128: \o

 19:10 <lvoytek> For an sru the fix for the bug must be in the development release. Then the SRU template must be filled out in the launchpad bug description above the original text, including the impact it will have when released, the plan for testing the fix, in depth info on where problems could arise.

 19:11 <sil2100> lvoytek: good, what needs to be done after the upload is accepted into -proposed?

 19:12 <lvoytek> The sru team will review it to make sure all is good and either continue the upload or block and request changes

 19:12 <sil2100> That's true, but what about after the upload is already accepted? What needs to be done for it to land on the user's machines?

 19:13 <lvoytek> It has to move to the release pocket then the user can update on their end to get the fix

 19:14 <bdmurray> For a stable release would a package move to the release pocket?

 19:14 <lvoytek> the -updates pocket specifically

 19:15 <sil2100> What about validation of the update in -proposed? What do you, as the uploader, need to do to get this update into the -updates pocket?

 19:16 <lvoytek> Ah, make sure all builds succeed and autopkgtests pass

 19:17 <sil2100> That is important, yes, but is there something else needed for the update to be considered 'good-to-go'?

 19:18 <lvoytek> Yes, the package fix must be validated by enabling proposed and testing accordingly

 19:18 <sil2100> That's right o/

 19:19 <sil2100> lvoytek: ok, another one about SRUs: let's say you have a need for a new upstream release of a package as an SRU, because of reasonsâ„¢. Is that possible?

 19:20 <lvoytek> Yes, specifically in the case of MREs - minor releases that make a stable release more stable. Working on that for bind9 right now

 19:22 <sil2100> lvoytek: can you tell me what is required when preparing such an SRU? What are the requirements for the SRU bug and project/package that you are preparing?

 19:22 <sil2100> In other words: what would be the accept/not-accept criterium for such an upload

 19:24 <lvoytek> It also requires additional information in the report, some packages have special cases in this regard. The bugs that are being fixed should also be noted, along with security fixes. Releases after the current should also have a version >= the one being updated to

 19:25 <sil2100> When in doubt, where would you look for more information about this?

 19:26 <lvoytek> The sru wiki page shows special cases: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates For info on the release its best to look at the relevant upstream news or commits.

 19:27 <sil2100> Thanks! No more questions from me

 19:27 <lvoytek> Thanks!

 19:28 <utkarsh21021> I have a quick q/general curiosity - is there a reason you've not shadowed in any +1 maintenance yet? Because I believe, you'd be net win for Ubuntu/Canonical in doing that.

 19:28 <lvoytek> I haven't yet. Christian said it would be a good idea as I move toward core dev though

 19:29 <lvoytek> Just need to set it up when there's time

 19:30 <sil2100> Any other questions from other DMB members?

 19:31 <utkarsh21021> none from me

 19:31 <seb128> not from me

 19:31 <bdmurray> not from me

 19:32 <sil2100> rbasak: back to you then!

 19:41 <rbasak> ack

 19:41 <utkarsh21021> teward: I'd say exactly what I said last time: it's fun to see what you're up to usually around this time, haha ;)

 19:41 <rbasak> The thread at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2022-November/002099.html still needs a reply from most other DMB members please.

 19:42 <rbasak> Maybe we can discuss and vote on it in the next meeting that doesn't have applicants otherwise.
