 15:10 <juliank> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:10 <waveform> only took me (looks at history) two months!

 15:11 <bdrung> paride, good idea to check for crash files on upgrades.

 15:11 <juliank> bug 2012698 - seems like it's being handled?

 15:12 <slyon> yes, seems like

 15:12 <juliank> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:12 <juliank> bug 1999345 has no news yet, let's carry on

 15:12 <juliank> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs is empty

 15:12 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:13 <juliank> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <juliank> ubiquity ftbfs, vorlon uploaded that

 15:14 <schopin> looks like a tz issue... :)

 15:14 <bdmurray> Oh, I had to do some SRus in the past for timezone stuff

 15:15 <juliank> bdmurray volunteers to fix it

 15:15 <enr0n> ginggs: why did you trigger a migration-reference test for systemd on lunar/arm64?

 15:15 <juliank> cryptsetup blocking linux-meta-riscv (5.19.0.1004.4 to 6.2.0.19.19.2) for 0 days

 15:16 <bdmurray> Yeah, I'll fix ubiquity

 15:16 <ginggs> enr0n: queues were empty so i retried all regressions, and then triggered migration-reference tests for those that still failed

 15:16 <juliank> I think this cryptsetup is a kernel adt matrix issue or something

 15:17 <bdrung> bdmurray, I volunteer to review the change (since it is probably related to my tzdata changes)

 15:17 <bdmurray> but with the flaky infra doing a migration-reference/0 could create a failing baseline

 15:17 <enr0n> ginggs: ah, okay

 15:18 <schopin> as long as someone with a bd* nick handles it... :)

 15:18 <juliank> Who wants to check cryptsetup and follow up with kernel perhaps?

 15:18 <juliank> cryptsetup: juliank - oh well

 15:18 <juliank> glibc: schopin ?

 15:19 <schopin> ack

 15:19 <juliank> systemd: enr0n ?

 15:20 <juliank> I think both are just retries due to flaky infra

 15:20 <enr0n> juliank: sure, that just needs a retry from the looks of it

 15:20 <enr0n> Which I cannot trigger myself :)

 15:20 * juliank triggers

 15:20 <enr0n> thanks

 15:20 <juliank> ah ginggs already triggered

 15:20 <juliank> this might be a regression in the rpi kernel

 15:21 <juliank> so uh kernel team

 15:21 <juliank> that's all

 15:21 <juliank> #topic AOB

 15:22 <ginggs> FTBFS party

 15:22 <ginggs> https://people.canonical.com/~ginggs/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20230324-lunar-lunar.html#foundations-bugs-team

 15:22 <enr0n> I am EOW starting in about 1.5 hours

 15:22 <slyon> easter holidays are coming up. Fri & Mon off for many of us

 15:23 <ginggs> fwupd-signed and grub2-signed don't need to be investigated

 15:23 * juliank expects a new neighbour below the office room to move in, old one moved out Monday, I'd move on a long weekend, myself

 15:23 <ginggs> bdrung has initramfs-tools

 15:24 <ginggs> dviererbe has tar

 15:24 <ginggs> bdmurray has ubiquity

 15:26 <ginggs> slyon took cmake

 15:27 <juliank> I took aptdaemon

 15:27 <juliank> (There may be more build failing later and nobody wants to deal with that)

 15:27 <ginggs> schopin took icu

 15:28 <juliank> that's a wrap

 15:28 <sil2100> o/

 15:28 <juliank> #endmeeting
