 16:17 <ddstreet> teward not sure if you read his email yet, but i'm not totally clear on what he's asking about?

 16:18 <ddstreet> juliank in case you're around ^

 16:18 <teward> i havent - i have a ton of higher priority CC-hat emails drifting around

 16:19 <ddstreet> ok, let's just leave this one in the ML then, my reply was recent so let's give him some time to follow up

 16:19 <ddstreet> i'll keep it on the open threads

 16:19 <ddstreet> #action staging grub 2.12 backports in backports pocket during 24.04 developement cycle

 16:19 * meetingology staging grub 2.12 backports in backports pocket during 24.04 developement cycle

 16:19 <teward> i mean I don't see a benefit of this being in backports if its quirky and not stable

 16:19 <ddstreet> right, me neither

 16:20 <ddstreet> i assumed i must have misunderstood what he was proposing

 16:20 <teward> grub* is one of those things I dont think can be safely backported either without extreme care, hence why SRU/security processes cover it

 16:20 <teward> (using backports as staging isnt what backports is for)

 16:21 <ddstreet> yeah total agreement on that

 16:21 <ddstreet> #subtopic https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-October/023129.html

 16:21 <teward> (this is what Experimental is for Debian Unstable but I digress)

 16:21 <ddstreet> #undo

 16:21 <meetingology> Removing item from minutes: SUBTOPIC

 16:21 <ddstreet> #subtopic Backport uploads to non-LTS releases

 16:21 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2023-October/023129.html

 16:21 <ddstreet> this is for the cockpit uploads to the non-LTS releases

 16:22 <ddstreet> our current policy is to only allow specifically exempted packages to get backported to non-LTS

 16:22 <ddstreet> my email was just to revisit that (in general, not specifically for cockpit pkgs)

 16:23 <teward> i think cockpit is an exception not the rule.  the problem with interim releases is a lot of times backporting in interim can happen but then get lost in the chain

 16:23 <teward> historically it overloaded backporters

 16:23 <ddstreet> so it's probably better to keep the restriction but allow an exception for cockpit you think?

 16:24 <ddstreet> i'm fine either way, and i can see how it would overload us if it becomes more common

 16:24 <teward> imo there will always be exceptions

 16:24 <teward> on an adhoc basis or as needed

 16:24 <teward> but yes cockpit is one i would give as an exception

 16:24 <teward> and also add to our no-bug-needed backports list (its a special case)

 16:25 <ddstreet> i don't think we currently have any formal exception process for it currently, you think we need to define one, or just have informal exception agreements during our normal meetings?

 16:25 <teward> if it becomes more common, we can create formal processes.  for now as long as we are quorate on exceptions we should be OK

 16:26 <teward> i dont see us granting a lot of exceptions

 16:26 <ddstreet> agreed

 16:26 <ddstreet> ok so we're quorate (since we have 2/3 today) and we both agree to keep the non-LTS restriction but also to give an exception to cockpit (and cockpit-podman, cockpit-machines) for non-LTS and no-bug-required

 16:27 <ddstreet> right?

 16:27 <ddstreet> i can update our wiki page to add its exception if so

 16:27 <teward> if you are in agreement with me on all that then yes

 16:27 <ddstreet> yep i am

 16:27 <ddstreet> ok i'll update the exception list

 16:27 <teward> then go right ahead and update the wiki

 16:27 <teward> yep

 16:28 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet update exception list to add cockpit, cockpit-machines, cockpit-podman

 16:28 * meetingology ddstreet update exception list to add cockpit, cockpit-machines, cockpit-podman

 16:28 <ddstreet> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports#Allowed_in_non-LTS_releases

 16:28 <ddstreet> for my reference

 16:28 <ddstreet> ok i think that's all the ML threads unless i missed something

 16:29 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs needing discussion

 16:29 <ddstreet> I don't see any open bugs, and i went through the upload queues earlier today

 16:29 <ddstreet> i'll handle the cockpit uploads to non-LTS releases

 16:29 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet review cockpit uploads to non-LTS releases

 16:29 * meetingology ddstreet review cockpit uploads to non-LTS releases

 16:29 <teward> perfect

 16:30 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 16:30 <ddstreet> i think we've covered everything?

 16:30 <ddstreet> anything else?

 16:30 <teward> ddstreet: make a note that exceptions are evaluated on a case by case basis

 16:30 <ddstreet> yep

 16:30 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet note in wiki exceptions are evalated on a case by case basis

 16:30 * meetingology ddstreet note in wiki exceptions are evalated on a case by case basis

 16:31 <ddstreet> next mtg date?

 16:31 <ddstreet> #subtopic next mtg date

 16:31 <ddstreet> i think 4 wks gets into the holidays

 16:31 <teward> and are for exceptional cases NOT regular cases (so there has to be real strong support for an exception case for it to be approved)

 16:31 <teward> ye 4 weeks is right in holiday weeks

 16:31 <teward> we may be able to skip and just do an early january meeting in place of it

 16:31 <teward> if theres no objections

 16:31 <ddstreet> yeah let's move it to jan

 16:32 <ddstreet> works for me

 16:32 <teward> (email mapreri though to make sure they are OK with it)

 16:32 <ddstreet> yep

 16:32 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet email mapreri (and list) to pick next mtg date (probably in jan)

 16:32 * meetingology ddstreet email mapreri (and list) to pick next mtg date (probably in jan)

 16:33 <ddstreet> i think either jan 3 or jan 10 is most likely, probably jan 10 in case any of us is out right after the new year

 16:33 <ddstreet> but i'll email

 16:33 <teward> i'm always around by jan3 xD

 16:33 <ddstreet> lol i *probably* will be over my hangover by then ;-)

 16:33 <teward> IT Security never sleeps though so.  :P

 16:34 <ddstreet> yeah you might be around jan 1 in that line of work :)

 16:34 <teward> well thats a day off but technically you're right

 16:34 <teward> emergency or smth

 16:34 <ddstreet> hope that pager doesn't go off at 12:01am jan 1 ;-P

 16:34 <teward> lol

 16:35 <teward> well i am gonna go get food i'm hungry

 16:35 <ddstreet> sounds good and i think we're wrapped up!

 16:35 <ddstreet> thanks!

 16:35 <teward> if theres no other business?

 16:35 <teward> perfect thank you!  *disappears to lunch*

 16:35 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
