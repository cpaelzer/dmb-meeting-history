 12:06 <lucyllewy> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board 15th November 2023 12:00UTC

 12:06 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:06:59 UTC.  The chair is lucyllewy.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:07 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:07 <lucyllewy> #chair lucyllewy

 12:07 <meetingology> Current chairs: lucyllewy

 12:07 <lucyllewy> ok. here comes a big copy+pasta intro

 12:07 <lucyllewy> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 15th November 2023. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:07 <lucyllewy> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:07 <lucyllewy> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:07 <lucyllewy> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:07 <lucyllewy> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:07 <lucyllewy> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:07 <lucyllewy> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:08 <lucyllewy> #topic Michal Kohútek (tylnesh)

 12:09 <lucyllewy> Hi Michal, can you please introduce yourself to the board, share your wiki page or discourse post and your launchpad profile. If you could also state your preferred pronouns that would be appreciated.

 12:10 <tylnesh> Hello! I'm Michal (he/him) and I'm the current administrator for the czechoslovakian Ubuntu community. I'm maintaining the ubuntu.cz website, forum.ubuntu.cz, and our telegram group (Ubuntu CZ/SK). For the past few years, I've been trying to resurrect our local community. I've been giving talks, volunteering at events, manning booths, etc.

 12:11 <tylnesh> My application is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/michal-kohutek-tylnesh-membership-application/40115

 12:12 <lucyllewy> awesome. thank you. I'll pop your launchpad link too, for completeness https://launchpad.net/~kohutek-michal

 12:12 <tylnesh> Oh, thanks, forgot about that.. My launchpad account is kinda empty :-X

 12:13 <lucyllewy> Once everyone on the board has reviewed tylnesh 's application, please drop any questions in the channel

 12:13 <lucyllewy> First question from me is a formality for the record: I see you've signed the code of conduct. Can you confirm that you understand the wording and the requirements and that you agree to be bound by the code?

 12:14 <tylnesh> Yes, I've read, understood and stand by the code of conduct

 12:14 <lucyllewy> awesome <3

 12:15 <lucyllewy> Kilos: do you have any questions you'd like to ask?

 12:16 <Kilos> Well, after ready discourse I do not see anything I can add

 12:16 <lucyllewy> cool. it's a very thorough application :-)

 12:16 <tylnesh> O:-)

 12:17 <tylnesh> Well, I've been told to do it a few years back, so it's been brewing for a while

 12:17 <Kilos> tylnesh are you planning on staying active in ubuntu in the future

 12:17 <lucyllewy> I can see lots of good endorsements on your discourse post. Is there anyone else present who knows of any reason why these two shall not be wed ^H^H^H^H err does anyone else here want to supply an in-person endorsement?

 12:17 <tylnesh> Yes, definitely. I've been an user and a member of my local community since 2007 and I have many plans for it

 12:18 <Kilos> tylnesh good to hear that

 12:18 <lucyllewy> I'd like to ask if you intend to get deeper into the community, such as taking on more roles?

 12:18 <Kilos> like coffee maker

 12:18 <lucyllewy> yes. coffee!

 12:19 <lucyllewy> I've only been out of bed an hour :P

 12:19 <tylnesh> Yes, I would like to nominate myself for the newly established LoCo Council and my dream is to organize an Ubucon Europe in Slovakia or Czechia

 12:19 <Kilos> tylnesh that sounds great

 12:19 <lucyllewy> that's awesome (and why I asked the question, cos I knew you were thinking about it :P )

 12:20 <tylnesh> I must admit that I haven't felt a bit of an impostor syndrome, but I've been told by a few people that I should step forward...

 12:21 <Kilos> he who dares, wins

 12:21 <lucyllewy> good for them. yes, it's good for seasoned ubuntu members to encourage new applicants such as yourself.

 12:21 <lucyllewy> ok.. are we ready to move onto the voting then? I don't think anyone else is here to supply an in-person endorsement, so I think we can move onto the vote.

 12:21 <Kilos> go

 12:22 <lucyllewy> even with only two board members present I have two further proxy votes so we have a quorum of 4 votes total

 12:22 <lucyllewy> #vote Michal (tylnesh)'s membership application

 12:22 <meetingology> Please vote on: Michal (tylnesh)'s membership application

 12:22 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 12:25 <lucyllewy> congratulations on your membership, tylnesh ! I've got some more housekeeping stuff to paste for you. give me a second to grab it

 12:25 <tylnesh> Thank you very much!

 12:25 <Kilos> tylnesh Welcome aboard, Keep up the good work

 12:25 <Kilos> and congratulations

 12:25 <lucyllewy> Congratulations to all the new members. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/ (1/2)

 12:25 <lucyllewy> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them! (2/2)

 12:25 <tylnesh> Thanks...   But I guess the work has just begun

 12:26 <lucyllewy> I'll get you added to the group asap and send an announcement email to the Ubuntu news thingy

 12:26 <Kilos> hahaha

 12:26 <Kilos> thanks for chairing lucyllewy

 12:26 <lucyllewy> I look forward to seeing you more and more around - hopefully at more conferences if my health allows me to attend

 12:26 <tylnesh> I hope so too, I missed you very much in Riga

 12:27 <lucyllewy> thank you everyone for coming, and congratulations again to Michal for his successful application. You've already done a lot, and it seems you have a lot of good plans.

 12:27 <tylnesh> ;-)

 12:27 <lucyllewy> with that I'll stop the meeting logger

 12:27 <lucyllewy> #endmeeting
