 15:30 <slyon> Let's start with -proposed (it's pretty crowded)

 15:30 <joalif> o/

 15:30 <eslerm_> good morning o/

 15:31 <slyon> devscripts: I created a draft MIR for libdigest-md5-file-perl to hand it out to the foundations team

 15:31 <jamespage> o/

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <slyon> devscripts: libswitch-perl has been in main in the past

 15:31 <slyon> I wonder if we can just re-propote it? It's looking pretty healty from a quick sanity check

 15:31 <slyon> bug #785607

 15:32 <didrocks> hey

 15:32 <slyon> I guess this is a question for didrocks, jamespage or maybe sarnold if we did have some precendene on that in the past? (see my latest comment on that bug)

 15:32 <didrocks> so, in the past, that was a repromotion without question

 15:33 <didrocks> but now, we have stricter requirements

 15:33 <didrocks> in term of testing and so on

 15:33 <slyon> testing is covered for this one

 15:33 <didrocks> so, I would reask for a template + a full review if the package was promoted before those requirements

 15:33 <slyon> OK

 15:33 <didrocks> just for a sanity check

 15:33 <slyon> I will hand it out to the team then.

 15:33 <slyon> thanks

 15:33 <didrocks> yw

 15:33 <slyon> continuting with c-m-p

 15:33 <slyon> logcheck and the seeds are false-positives

 15:34 <slyon> libsub-quote-perl: I dropped that recommend an hour ago, so it should vanish from the report

 15:34 <sarnold> \o/

 15:34 <slyon> ceilometer: looking good, I think we can promote python-xmltodict. But we'll talk about that in our "updates" section

 15:35 <slyon> cups-browserd: boths deps pending security review

 15:35 <slyon> flashrom: I dropped the new libjaylink dependency/functionality (until somebody in Ubuntu actually wants to use it). So it should vanish, too

 15:36 <slyon> jaraco.text: this is with the openstack-team to fix things (cc jamespage)

 15:36 <slyon> netplan.io: mdurl & mardown-it-py are pending security review

 15:36 <jamespage> ack re jaraco.text

 15:36 <slyon> rich: this should be tagged for security review, too (cc sarnold, eslerm_) - see my latest comment on the bug

 15:37 <slyon> pkgconf: looking good, ready for promotion. I prepared a seed change eralier today, to switch pkg-config -> pkgconf. Pending review from my teammates

 15:37 <slyon> licensecheck: pending MIR by a collegue of mine

 15:37 <slyon> policykit-1: pending sec-review

 15:38 <slyon> for c-m: nothing new. libsub-quote-perl got resolved in -proposed as stated earlier

 15:38 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 15:38 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:38 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:38 <didrocks> \o/

 15:38 <sarnold> slyon: we may have skipped non-proposed

 15:39 <slyon> Nothing \o/ (we might still have some work left from last week)

 15:39 <didrocks> (and yes)

 15:39 <slyon> sarnold: "for c-m: nothing new. libsub-quote-perl got resolved in -proposed as stated earlier" (see above)

 15:39 <sarnold> oh! I see it now

 15:39 <slyon> bug #2007279

 15:40 <slyon> (draft to be handed out to the foundations team to fill the template)

 15:40 <slyon> bug #2003083

 15:40 <slyon> draft to be filled by the foundations team (tracking update)

 15:40 <slyon> bug #2002576

 15:40 <slyon> This got security ACK

 15:41 <slyon> and MIR ACK. it's being pulled in already by ceilometer

 15:41 <slyon> openstack team is subscribed

 15:41 <slyon> so I think it's ready for promotion

 15:41 <slyon> didrocks: could you handle this?

 15:41 <sarnold> ack

 15:41 <didrocks> sure

 15:41 <slyon> thx!

 15:41 <slyon> and that's all for recent updates

 15:42 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:42 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:42 <slyon> sarnold: how are things looking?

 15:42 <sarnold> mm, is log4cplus overlooked / neglected?

 15:43 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/log4cplus/+bug/2003549  -- currently unassigned, I'm wondering if this ought to be back on the server team

 15:43 <slyon> log4cplus is older than last week's meeting.

 15:43 <slyon> (and pending input from the MIR reporter)

 15:43 <sarnold> athos: ^^ https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/log4cplus/+bug/2003549

 15:43 <sarnold> there we go, now my conscience is clean :)

 15:44 <slyon> sarnold: nice. I've also assigned the bug accordingly

 15:44 <sarnold> so, security queue, I'm feeling good with our current position; this is the closest we've bbeen to getting things done before feature freeze, ever :)

 15:44 <slyon> that's very nice to hear. Kudos to the security team!

 15:44 <sarnold> there's enough on our plate that I don't think *everything* will be done before feature freeze, but it's hard to guess where exactly the misses might be :(

 15:44 <didrocks> yes, this is great to hear :)

 15:45 <sarnold> anyway, this feels good. thanks everyone for the help :)

 15:45 <slyon> could we get this into the security queue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rich/+bug/2003570 ?

 15:45 <slyon> (still fine post-ff, but should be this cycle)

 15:45 <didrocks> sarnold: just be informed that I’m assigning the cups* transition to the security. I feel the first promotion to main were done before the MIR process was created. There are quite some gaps and some components are quite critical (running as root, setuid, parsing data format)

 15:46 <eslerm_> maybe, could you review SEC-1640 privately in JIRA?

 15:46 <didrocks> even if it’s monitored for CVE, I think it’s the right time for a re-review

 15:47 <sarnold> hmm, I wonder if we should re-poke upstream, how long ago was that?

 15:47 <eslerm_> almost a week now

 15:48 <eslerm_> I could assign CVEs and move on with review

 15:48 <eslerm_> pcs is taking my priority currently though

 15:48 <sarnold> didrocks: with a project that mature and (i'm guessing underresourced) it might be a challenge to get sweeping architectural changes of the sort that we'd expect from projects these days :( setuid executables parsing things isj ust a horrible feeling..

 15:49 <sarnold> I've gotten the impression completing the pcs stack is our top priority at the moment, I think that should continue

 15:49 <sarnold> but a quick re-poke of upstream is cheap enough / easy enough

 15:49 <eslerm_> can do

 15:49 <slyon> who will do that poking of upstream?

 15:49 <slyon> thank you!

 15:50 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 15:50 <sarnold> rich https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-1694

 15:50 <sarnold> none here

 15:50 <slyon> sarnold: thanks!

 15:51 <didrocks> nothing here, thanks!

 15:51 <joalif> none

 15:51 <eslerm_> none either

 15:51 <slyon> alright folks, that's all for today :) o/
