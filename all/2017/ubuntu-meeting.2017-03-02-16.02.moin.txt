 16:06 <sil2100> That's a lesson for me trying to be over-helpful, but to my defence I must say that I have not known before that I am to double-check the sanity of what the kernel team's automation does

 16:11 <xnox> ..

 16:11 <slangasek> bdmurray: have you talked with the snappy team about whether they're going to be providing a systemd timers interface?

 16:12 <caribou> BugFix:

 16:12 <caribou> LP #1638695 : Python performance regression in Xenial

 16:12 <caribou> - Made analysis available, barry send email to python-dev ML

 16:12 <caribou> - Disabling LTO seems to improve things

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1638695 in python2.7 (Ubuntu) "Python 2.7.12 performance regression" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1638695

 16:12 <caribou> - Running the benchmarks on another arch could be useful

 16:12 <bdmurray> slangasek: nobody responded to me in #snappy

 16:12 <slangasek> ooh and I need to look at the sru report to find out who's surprising on there

 16:12 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm :/

 16:12 <caribou> LP #1654600 : unattended-upgrades breaks shutdown when /var is FS

 16:12 <caribou> - solution proposed in upstream Debian bug. Will upload to Z & SRU

 16:12 <caribou> - Identification slowed down by what might be another u-u bug

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1654600 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu) "unattended-upgrade-shutdown hangs when /var is a separate filesystem" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1654600

 16:13 <caribou> Dev:

 16:13 <caribou> Sosreport 3.3 trusty SRU

 16:13 <caribou> - Need to FFE for newer upstream release as sos 3.4 is coming shortly

 16:13 <caribou> â˜‘ Done

 16:13 <bdmurray> caribou: what other u-u bug?

 16:13 <caribou> bdmurray: UnattendedUpgrade::RunOnShutdown doesn't seem to work as the network is off by the time it runs

 16:13 <slangasek> sil2100: yeah, I don't double-check the bug tasks.. that's what their automation is supposed to handle

 16:14 <chiluk> * lp 1647389 - Finally got a smaller reproduction environment put together for this.  That allowed me to complete my bisection which was previously being held up by openstack not liking my constant replacing of qemu *(i.e. nova crashes, libvirt crashes, etc.).  Cherrypick of that patch does not apply cleanly, I'm proceeding to work through back-porting/figuring out if there are any other patches that need to be

 16:14 <chiluk> brought in.  I have a feeling there will be at least one more patch required before this is complete.  However, I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel on this one.

 16:14 <chiluk> * Recovered from a disk failure in my raid 5 *(which was also hosting the VM for the above reproducer).

 16:14 <chiluk> * DMB approved my core-dev application this week.  Thanks for that guys.

 16:14 <chiluk> - done -

 16:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1647389 in qemu (Ubuntu) "Regression: Live migrations can still crash after CVE-2016-5403 fix" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1647389

 16:14 <caribou> bdmurray: unless I don't understand how it owrks

 16:14 <robru> * archive maintenance mentoring from cyphermox

 16:14 <robru> britney

 16:14 <robru> * Email Policy, emails uploaders when package stuck in proposed (in review)

 16:14 <robru> * workaround for Source PPA Policy, groups migration of packages from same bileto ticket (needs review, bug #1648000)

 16:14 <robru> (done)

 16:14 <ubottu> bug 1648000 in Launchpad itself "need API to discover where a given package is copied from" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1648000

 16:15 <caribou> bdmurray: I have yet to create the LP: bug

 16:15 <bdmurray> robru: what will happen with stuff already stuck in proposed? will we only get emails about new stickers?

 16:16 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm I did merge your branch, right?  why does the sru report not look different

 16:16 <robru> bdmurray: the current code as written keeps a cache of what it has and hasn't emailed. the first run will see that it hasn't emailed anything and pump out a giant spam for everything that's been stuck for more than a day. after that it'll settle and only email new things that have been sitting for longer than a day.

 16:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: oh, it does look different, if I both reload and look at my screen

 16:17 <bdmurray> slangasek: did you see the surprising results?

 16:18 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you mean init-system-helpers? :)

 16:18 <bdmurray> slangasek: no, the number of things vorlon has unverified. ;-)

 16:18 <slangasek> oh are there a number of them?

 16:18 <bdmurray> robru: will there be an announcement before the spam event?

 16:18 <slangasek> guess I should do something about those

 16:19 <bdmurray> otherwise somebody might nag you!

 16:19 <slangasek> well I got the nag mail about init-system-helpers, that's why it's verified now ;)

 16:20 <slangasek> robru: could you draft an announcement mail for us to send out before we merge the email policy and make it live?

 16:21 <robru> slangasek:

 16:21 <robru> slangasek: sure. will send to  you for approval

 16:21 <bdmurray> robru: Also will the roll-out be for every release of just zesty?

 16:22 <slangasek> robru: can you stick it in a google doc so we can collaborate?

 16:22 <robru> bdmurray: it would be for all releases

 16:23 <bdmurray> cool

 16:23 <robru> slangasek: should I maybe make it so that it only emails packages that are 1 <= daysold <= 20 or something? to prevent emailing the dozens that are languishing for years?

 16:24 <slangasek> robru: I think we are going to want to do a dry run and see who's getting emailed for what, before we decide; but my sense is that we don't want an upper cap

 16:24 <slangasek> anything else on status?

 16:24 <robru> slangasek: well going forward, all packages would be emailed the day they turn daysold 1. The upper cap would only affect packages that are *already* daysold > 1

 16:25 <slangasek> yes

 16:25 <slangasek> and I think we do want to email the backlog

 16:26 <robru> alright

 16:26 <robru> slangasek: there's no way to do a dry run currently. should I add that?

 16:27 <slangasek> robru: doesn't need merged, but at least for a one-off locally I think we want to see who it /would/ email for what

 16:27 <slangasek> robru: anyway, we can discuss further outside the meeting

 16:27 <slangasek> maybe in the MP :)

 16:27 <slangasek> anything else on status?

 16:27 <robru> slangasek: ok well for a one-off all you have to do is comment out the smtp.send_message and replace it with a self.log(...)

 16:28 <slangasek> right

 16:29 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:29 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:29 <cyphermox> I want more ram?

 16:29 <infinity> You can't have more RAM.

 16:30 <cyphermox> CanadaPost is slow.

 16:30 <barry> i might be sending a long-ish email about this autopkgtest failure i'm seeing.  thoughts, feedback would be very welcome ;)

 16:32 <slangasek> going once...

 16:32 <slangasek> going twice...

 16:32 <slangasek> #endmeeting
