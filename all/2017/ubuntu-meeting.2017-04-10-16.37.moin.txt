 16:38 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:38 <jdstrand> hey

 16:38 <jdstrand> last week I mostly caught up on snappy reviews, the tty one remains

 16:38 <jdstrand> this week working on various snapd policy updates for zesty

 16:38 <jdstrand> start looking at wayland/gnome3 interfaces

 16:38 <jdstrand> have a few review tools updates to do

 16:38 <jdstrand> need to poke at devs for k8s snaps to get k8s interface moving again

 16:39 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:39 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I have a short week today, I go on vacation tomorrow

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm working on en embargoed issue

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I have webkit2gtk updates to publish also

 16:39 <mdeslaur> that's about it

 16:39 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week

 16:39 <sbeattie> I have some kernel signoffs to do

 16:40 <sbeattie> I'll be looking at the list for updates to do

 16:40 <sbeattie> There's also some apparmor list mail for me to go through as well.

 16:41 <sbeattie> that's probably it for me. tyhicks?

 16:42 <tyhicks> sbeattie: thanks - think it'll be important for you to pick up some updates this week

 16:42 <tyhicks> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:42 <tyhicks> I just reviewed a snapd PR regarding device key generation and did some additional research around that

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'll be hashing out a few more details regarding the seccomp logging work on the lkml and hopefully will be able to start finalizing the seccomp v5 patch set within a day or two

 16:43 <tyhicks> still doing some 12.04 ESM prep

 16:44 <tyhicks> and I still need to do some upstream ecryptfs work to review PRs

 16:44 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:44 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <jjohansen> I have some bugs I am working on/need to follow up on. An rlimit issue that has surfaced in zesty (1679704)

 16:46 <jjohansen> a ptrace issue, that there is no bug for yet, and I am not sure the user understands what is going on (so a quick check hopefully)

 16:47 <jjohansen> and then upstreaming work

 16:47 <jjohansen> unless directed otherwise

 16:47 <tyhicks> sounds good to me

 16:47 <jjohansen> thats it for /me sarnold you are up

 16:47 <sarnold> I'm on cve triage; it's a shotr week for me, off thurs, friday, and monday next week too

 16:48 <sarnold> shadow still hangs over my head

 16:48 <sarnold> as does mellon

 16:48 <sarnold> lasso, rather

 16:48 <sarnold> anyway, that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> I've got an embargoed update to do this week

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> In addition to that, I'm trying to debug a firefox crash (struggling to focus on this though tbh)

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> And I need to reach out to mozilla to discuss the start page

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 16:50 <ratliff> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:50 <ratliff> I have to finalize my charts and script for the webinar

 16:50 <ratliff> I am reviewing the flavors CVE pages script to see if it can be tweaked

 16:51 <ratliff> If there is more time, I'll do vivd updates

 16:51 <ratliff> back to you, tyhicks

 16:51 <tyhicks> thanks
