 15:25 <slangasek> ok

 15:25 <slangasek> any questions over status?

 15:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:26 <slangasek> anything else this week?

 15:27 <infinity> Nein.

 15:28 <gaughen> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 15:28 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bug triage

 15:28 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 15:29 <gaughen> any bugs on this list that we need to discuss?

 15:29 <gaughen> I see the first bug on the list isn't assigned to an individual

 15:29 <slangasek> yes, I triaged it to the team

 15:30 <slangasek> maybe we want to look at https://bugs.launchpad.net/~canonical-foundations/+assignedbugs instead? :)

 15:30 <cyphermox> there's something else too, related to that rls-aa-*

 15:30 <gaughen> OMG slangasek that list is scary!

 15:30 <gaughen> 7 year old bugs!

 15:31 <gaughen> are we really going to fix those issues? or should we close some of this cruft as won't fix?

 15:31 <cyphermox> fyi, we've been discussing the tem used for the desktop team to track MIRs (team subscription), this may mess up the reports a bit until it's all fixed up

 15:31 <cyphermox> mostly a matter of desktop-bugs vs. desktop-packages.

 15:31 <slangasek> some should be unassigned, some should be closed

 15:31 <slangasek> but I'm not sure it makes sense for us to go through that in realtime right now

 15:32 <gaughen> agreed, slangasek

 15:32 <gaughen> but definitely a list we should walk through

 15:32 <slangasek> although, I did think LP: #1696970 should be assigned to xnox

 15:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1696970 in systemd (Ubuntu Artful) "softlockup DoS causes systemd-journald.service to abort with SIGABORT" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1696970

 15:34 <slangasek> neither gaughen nor xnox objects

 15:35 <xnox> sure

 15:35 <gaughen> sure

 15:35 <gaughen> assign it to rbalint

 15:36 <slangasek> xnox: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1624317

 15:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1624317 in systemd (Ubuntu Artful) "systemd-resolved breaks VPN with split-horizon DNS" [High,Confirmed]

 15:37 <slangasek> and I think that's it for today

 15:38 <slangasek> #endmeeting
