 22:04 <pleia2> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:04 <pleia2> #topic aisrael Membership

 22:04 <pleia2> aisrael: the floor is yours :)

 22:05 <aisrael> Hi everyone. I'm Adam, a longtime-ubuntu user (since it was no-name-yet linux), and a Canonical employee going on three years now.

 22:06 <aisrael> Most of my time has been spent on the server side of things, when I ran a busy ad serving engine on Ubuntu, handling up to 1B requests/day on a relatively small number of servers.

 22:07 <aisrael> These days, I work on Juju and Open Source Mano (telco stuff), run Ubuntu at home, and do little bits of work on desktop apps when the itch strikes me.

 22:07 <aisrael> My wiki page is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdamIsrael

 22:07 <aisrael> and my launchpad profile is here: https://launchpad.net/~aisrael

 22:08 <pleia2> ooh the asterisk charm, used much asterisk in production? (it's a beast)

 22:08 <aisrael> and my github, for completion: https://github.com/AdamIsrael

 22:08 <aisrael> pleia2: Not yet, but my hope is to get it to production quality.

 22:08 * pleia2 nods

 22:09 <pleia2> nice to see from a testimonal that you've also worked to help others get their charms written :)

 22:09 <pleia2> anyone else have any questions for aisrael?

 22:10 <aisrael> That's a large part of my current duties. I've been working with many of the telco's involved in OSM to write charms for their networking apps

 22:10 <wxl> whoa OSM is pretty freaking cool.

 22:10 <lazyPower> I can personally vouch for aisrael's dedication to the cause. He's been a stellar community member helping others

 22:10 <lazyPower> i think i left a testimonial some time ago, but i thought i'd lend my 2 cents

 22:11 <marcoceppi> aisrael: have you done much with your LOCO?

 22:11 <wxl> marcoceppi: seems that's on his todo list

 22:11 <marcoceppi> That it does seem

 22:11 <wxl> XD

 22:11 <aisrael> marcoceppi: Not since I moved. There isn't a local LOCO, unfortunately, but I'm going to work with the local hackspace to start one up

 22:11 <marcoceppi> cool, thanks!

 22:12 <aisrael> I started the original Chicago LOCO many years ago, so I'm vaguely familiar with the process. ;)

 22:12 <wxl> yeah no questions over here

 22:13 <pleia2> alright, gonna see if I can drag in another board member here to see if we can move this to voting ;)
