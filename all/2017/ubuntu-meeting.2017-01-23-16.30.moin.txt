 16:30 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:31 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:31 <jdstrand> This week I plan to work on:

 16:31 <jdstrand> - various PR reviews (8 new ones since friday)

 16:31 <jdstrand> - miscellaneous apparmor policy updates

 16:31 <jdstrand> - prepare snap for testing security policy

 16:31 <jdstrand> - seccomp arg filtering policy

 16:31 <jdstrand> that's it from me. mdeslaur, you're up

 16:31 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week, so i'll be sponsoring a bunch of stuff

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I have a short week, I'm off on friday

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I plan on publishing a couple of usns this afternoon, and if I have time I'll be picking something from the list

 16:32 <mdeslaur> that's it from me, sbeattie, you're up

 16:32 <sbeattie> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:33 <sbeattie> I'll have openjdk-8 packages from tdaitx to test and publish

 16:34 <sbeattie> I need to push some packages to the security pocket that recent linux-raspi2 kernels depend on.

 16:34 <sbeattie> after that, I'll be going through the list looking for updates as well

 16:34 <sbeattie> that's it for me, tyhicks?

 16:34 <tyhicks> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:35 <tyhicks> I will finish and submit the second revision of seccomp/libseccomp patches to upstream

 16:35 <tyhicks> I am also working on uploading AppArmor 2.11.0 to zesty but have hit some test failures that need to be sorted out first

 16:35 <tyhicks> I have an embargoed issue

 16:35 <tyhicks> any free time will go towards a security update

 16:35 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:35 <tyhicks> jjohansen: go ahead

 16:36 <jjohansen> I will be looking into some outstanding bugs 1658219, and 1656121

 16:36 <ubottu> bug 1658219 in AppArmor "flock not mediated by 'k'" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1658219

 16:36 <jjohansen> and probably a couple more

 16:37 <jjohansen> I have a nice stack of patches for the xenial/yakketty kernels that I need to cleanup and send up to the kteam

 16:38 <jjohansen> I will be doing some work on revising the dconf/gsetting patches and synching with will on them

 16:39 <jjohansen> and if I have any time I will be working on the next steps in upstreaming, likely the securityfs modification RFC

 16:40 <jjohansen> thats it for me, sarnold? you're up

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week; I expect to finish the uvp-monitor sorta-mir today, I'll file some bugs with upstream project for things i've found so far. I'm having trouble seeing the point of the thing compared to e.g. collectd or other popular tools...

 16:41 <sarnold> so tyhicks, another suggestion for the next thing to undertake soon, but not immediately :)

 16:42 <sarnold> also I'm losing verbs at an astounding rate. good luck.

 16:42 <tyhicks> sarnold: what's the suggestion?

 16:42 <sarnold> tyhicks: hehe, the missing bit, "I need another suggestion" :) if it's another MIR or reactive or whatever

 16:43 <ratliff> I would vote for libapache2-mod-auth-mellon

 16:43 <tyhicks> I think there are some new MIRs that I need to add to the list

 16:44 <tyhicks> I bet ratliff's suggestion is the right one to take next

 16:44 <sarnold> works for me, thanks :)

 16:44 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> It's firefox update week this week

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> In addition to that, I need to fix some issues in the ubufox extension caused by breaking changes in firefox 53 (removal of the non-standard 'for each' syntax)

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> I'll also be spending time trying to get rust backported, but I need to talk to foundations first to agree how to split the work

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I'll be working on oxide stuff, particularly work around JS dialogs

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:47 <ratliff> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:47 <ratliff> I will spend time working on updates for snappy-prev

 16:47 <ratliff> back to you tyhicks

 16:48 <tyhicks> thanks!

 16:48 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:48 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:48 <tyhicks> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 16:48 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 16:48 <tyhicks> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:49 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: I wanted to ask what sort of deadline are we looking at for having rustc available in the archive in old stable releases that don't already include it?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> tyhicks, I'm not entirely sure yet. Mozilla said firefox will depend on it in "early 2017", but that will give us between 12-18 weeks before it reaches stable

 16:52 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: ok, thanks

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> So we've still got 3 months, at least

 16:52 * tyhicks nods

 16:53 <tyhicks> jdstrand, mdeslaur, sbeattie, jjohansen, sarnold, ChrisCoulson, ratliff: Thanks!
