 16:00 <rbasak> #startmeeting ubuntu-server

 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Nov 14 16:00:24 2017 UTC.  The chair is rbasak. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:00 <rbasak> Today is a special meeting, as we're considering whether to change the format entirely.

 16:01 <rbasak> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2017-November/007621.html

 16:01 <rbasak> #link https://community.ubuntu.com/t/irc-meeting-office-hours/1491

 16:01 <cpaelzer> late o/

 16:01 <rbasak> Does anyone here have any further comment on it?

 16:02 <rbasak> If not, we can proceed to a vote.

 16:02 <slashd> rbasak, I like the idea

 16:02 <ahasenack> so we will essentially hang out in #ubuntu-server, where we already are

 16:03 <rbasak> Right

 16:03 <cpaelzer> what was sync'ed here so far works there as well - I like the chance for wider participation (if other people on #ubuntu-server) see the discussion

 16:03 <ahasenack> but at this time of day we will be hosting this office-hours

 16:04 <ahasenack> will we have an agenda? Maybe just something interesting that happened in the past week that we would like to highlight?

 16:04 <ahasenack> no agendas I suppose

 16:04 <rbasak> OK, looks like everyone is genreally in favour.

 16:04 <cpaelzer> no agendas, everybody can bring his own agenda

 16:04 <ahasenack> as we don't want to move the meeting to just another irc channel

 16:04 <rbasak> I suggest that we vote on moving it, and if successful, we just switch to office hours in #ubuntu-server immediately to conduct any other business.

 16:04 <cpaelzer> in case needed we spontanously elect one of the team to moderate

 16:04 <rbasak> (so skipping the agenda)

 16:04 <ahasenack> ok

 16:05 <rbasak> #vote Switch IRC meeting to office hours as per dpb's proposal
