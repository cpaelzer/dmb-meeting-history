 16:03 <slangasek> #startmeeting

 16:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Jan 19 16:03:48 2017 UTC.  The chair is slangasek. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:03 <meetingology> 

 16:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:03 <cyphermox> kind of wondering why that's required for audio?

 16:04 <slangasek> chiluk: able to /initiate/ it from the OS, I think you mean :)

 16:04 <xnox> chiluk, but it kind of does reboot system into the UEFI egg, hence can't do anything

 16:04 <slangasek> [TOPIC] lightning round

 16:04 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko bdmurray slangasek caribou infinity sil2100 robru cyphermox tdaitx xnox chiluk mwhudson)

 16:04 <gaughen> o/

 16:04 <slangasek> barry caribou infinity doko mwhudson xnox chiluk slangasek tdaitx bdmurray robru cyphermox sil2100

 16:04 <chiluk> oh yeah forgot about that xnox.. still slick.

 16:04 <barry> win!

 16:04 <sil2100> Damn, I won...

 16:04 <barry> no meeting last week, so 2-week status

 16:04 <barry> python-webencodings 0.5-2; python-persistent 4.2.2-1; various other debian things; html5lib/python-bleach regressions - will be looking at proposed branch to regress html5lib to seven-9s version (test w/pip); python-pip 9.0.1-2 (fixes python3.6 compat); python-mode 1:6.2.3-1

 16:04 * sil2100 hates being last, needs to wait so long for his turn

 16:05 <barry> network-manager still has not promoted due to systemd regression; looked at LP: #1647031 (still cannot reproduce locally due to kvm crash *inside* virt-qemu); i think this is not related to network-manager but a more general systemd regression (i think pitti confirmed)

 16:19 <sil2100> (done)

 16:19 <cyphermox> slangasek: it should help making that not suck.

 16:19 <slangasek> alrighty

 16:19 <cyphermox> barry: did you have fun with systemd/network-manager? I kind of expected having to deal with that :)

 16:19 <barry> cyphermox: oh, lots :(

 16:20 <barry> cyphermox: let's talk after the meeting

 16:20 <cyphermox> sure.

 16:20 <slangasek> cyphermox: AIUI you still can deal with it, since systemd is blocking things?

 16:20 <cyphermox> slangasek: yes, just need to catch up on what has been done so far.

 16:20 <slangasek> ok

 16:20 <slangasek> anything on status?

 16:21 <cyphermox> I do need some SRU reviews.

 16:22 <slangasek> cyphermox: which release / anything that warrants queue jumping?

 16:22 <cyphermox> some things that would be good to have for 16.04; grub2 and grub-installer on ppc64el

 16:22 * xnox would want netcfg sru review

 16:22 <cyphermox> not that it warrants queue jumping though.

 16:23 <xnox> (it is small if one filterdiff -x */po/* spew from debconf-update)

 16:23 <bdmurray> the queue is rather long...

 16:23 <cyphermox> and the equivalent SRUs for yakkety.

 16:23 <slangasek> cyphermox: I don't see grub2 in queue for xenial

 16:23 <cyphermox> there's also juju-core.

 16:23 <cyphermox> grub2 in xenial was already moved to proposed.

 16:23 <xnox> maybe i should spend time verifying things in there, cause there is a lot of committed things, but not validated =/

 16:23 <slangasek> cool; I can commit a big block of time to reviews tomorrow

 16:24 <slangasek> fwiw I've done some sru releases this morning prompted by maas needing released, looks like we've had a backlog of things needing released?

 16:24 <slangasek> xnox: yes, that too

 16:24 <sil2100> I can also continue working on SRUs tomorrow, but still there will have to be someone to double-check them for me

 16:24 <sil2100> So not much help from me yet

 16:24 <slangasek> sil2100: your mentor hasn't given you the green light yet to do them on your own?

 16:24 <xnox> yeah, things that got released today were all dandy =)

 16:24 <cyphermox> I'll have a good look at pending-sru to see if there are things I can review that slipped through the cracks

 16:25 <slangasek> [TOPIC] SRUs

 16:25 <slangasek> ohey topic

 16:25 <cyphermox> wee

 16:25 <sil2100> I didn't do that many of them, some were reviewed by Robie

 16:25 <sil2100> Since I overlap with him more than bdmurray usually

 16:25 <bdmurray> He hasn't looked at releasing verified stuff either afaik.

 16:25 <sil2100> No, that not yet, just doing UNAPPROVED reviews so far

 16:26 <slangasek> sil2100: ok.  you asked me earlier about whether you should be set loose, and I said your mentor should comment; has rbasak given an indicator of what's left to do?

 16:26 <bdmurray> slangasek: I think there were / are a fair number of autopkgtest failures with the SRUs

 16:26 <slangasek> bdmurray: yeah, I just marked nplan bad-test in yakkety for example

 16:27 <slangasek> ATM the only way those autopkgtest failures get resolved is if the sru team drives them, so...

 16:27 <bdmurray> that's sad

 16:28 <slangasek> bdmurray: well, nothing flags the autopkgtest failures on the bug and nobody but the sru team looks at http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html

 16:28 <slangasek> so maybe we need automation to post to the sru bugs when there are autopkgtest failures?

 16:29 <bdmurray> slangasek: from sru-report or the autopkgtest infrastructure?

 16:29 <slangasek> bdmurray: sru-report is probably saner

 16:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you want to follow up on this?

 16:31 <bdmurray> I'll have a think about it (the bug)

 16:31 <sil2100> slangasek: let me poke Robie to see if he was happy with my SRU reviews so far

 16:31 <slangasek> [ACTION] bdmurray to think about exposing autopkgtest failures on SRU bugs

 16:31 * meetingology bdmurray to think about exposing autopkgtest failures on SRU bugs

 16:31 <slangasek> sil2100: ok, cool

 16:31 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:31 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:31 <sil2100> bdmurray: you think if Robie gives me a +1 I could at least do the UNAPPROVED ones by myself? :)

 16:32 <slangasek> doko, gaughen: fwiw we need to talk about rustc... the security team tells me it's becoming a hard build-dependency for new upstream versions of firefox

 16:32 <bdmurray> sil2100: Have not approved anything? If so why?

 16:32 <sil2100> bdmurray: I would then poke you or him for the verified ones if I start going though them

 16:32 <gaughen> ack

 16:32 <sil2100> bdmurray: I was approving, but only after you or Robie double-checked them

 16:32 <bdmurray> sil2100: So you haven't REJECTED anything?

 16:32 <cyphermox> my AOB: if someone pings me for something and I don't respond, ping harder, I may be in the zone working on the bond and bridge support for netplan.

 16:33 <doko> slangasek: yes, I expected something like this ... that's why I updated it. only problem ... doesn't yet exist for armhf. maybe it will with the next release

 16:33 <cyphermox> (ie. telegram beeps on my phone)

 16:33 <sil2100> bdmurray: not yet actually, not besides the ones that were superseeded (like the ubuntu-image ones)

 16:33 <slangasek> doko: right.  but I guess we need to SRU this all the way back to trusty as well

 16:33 <doko> slangasek: the good thing is that we already have the regular llvm updates ...

 16:34 <bdmurray> sil2100: I think its important to have an understanding of what types of things cause a reject.

 16:34 <doko> ahh, not yet 3.9 ... so we to convince the mesa maintainers =)

 16:34 <xnox> do we support firefox/armhf on trusty?!

 16:34 <sil2100> bdmurray: agreed

 16:35 <slangasek> xnox: we don't have *any* rustc package in trusty

 16:35 <slangasek> xnox: and in xenial, we only have it on amd64 + i386

 16:35 <sil2100> bdmurray: yeah, didn't have any packages that would warrant a reject - ubuntu-image had issues that I found and pointed out and reuploaded, but that was just it

 16:35 <bdmurray> sil2100: I guess when I look at the queue today and find things to reject I could send them your way, but then you'd know to look real carefully!

 16:35 <slangasek> so it's a bit of a mess, given that the firefox package does exist on other archs in previous LTSes

 16:35 <xnox> as in i thought trusty should be red herring as there is no armhf desktop platform with X stack that can run firefox.

 16:36 <xnox> (w.r.t. lack of armhf in rustc)

 16:36 <xnox> =?

 16:36 <xnox> =/

 16:36 <slangasek> well, as I said, armhf is not specifically the issue

 16:37 <slangasek> ok... anything else?
