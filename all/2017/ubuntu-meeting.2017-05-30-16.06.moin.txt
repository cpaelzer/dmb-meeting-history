 16:07 <powersj> FYI we have a sprint agenda item to do all of these ;)

 16:07 <rharper> ack

 16:07 <cpaelzer> oh I see

 16:08 <cpaelzer> so I carry rharper's as well

 16:08 <cpaelzer> #ACTION: rharper to write a server guide entry on v2 yaml support in cloud-init (carried over)

 16:08 * meetingology : rharper to write a server guide entry on v2 yaml support in cloud-init (carried over)

 16:08 * cpaelzer teward to add release notes blurb for nginx (1.10.x -> 1.12.x) (carried over)

 16:08 <teward> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NGINX/ReleaseNotes/Artful

 16:08 <teward> probably needs improvement and needs a once-over from someone OTHER than me, but at least started there.

 16:08 <teward> (I had no computer, so I dropped it in a sublocation under the NGINX pages)

 16:08 <cpaelzer> see guys, this is how things are done

 16:09 <cpaelzer> dpb1: could you add to review and move this to the real release notes to our sprint?

 16:09 <nacc> tewards puts us all to shame

 16:09 <cpaelzer> teward: has done the base work, if we need we can reach out to him

 16:09 <cpaelzer> otherwise we can review polish and edit the reelase notes on the sprint

 16:09 <dpb1> cpaelzer: ok

 16:09 <teward> nacc: i'mma remember you said that :P

 16:09 <cpaelzer> dpb1: you don't need an action here to take that into the sprint notes right?

 16:10 <dpb1> cpaelzer: add an action

 16:10 <dpb1> that way we can get one done!

 16:10 <cpaelzer> #ACTION dpb1 to add the review of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NGINX/ReleaseNotes/Artful to the sprint agenda

 16:10 * meetingology dpb1 to add the review of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NGINX/ReleaseNotes/Artful to the sprint agenda

 16:10 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NGINX/ReleaseNotes/Artful

 16:11 <cpaelzer> ok one done, thanks teward

 16:11 <cpaelzer> dpb1: while we are at it how about

 16:11 <teward> cpaelzer: yep!

 16:11 * cpaelzer dpb to look into a few open issues around automatic updates that were pointed out by the doc team (carried over)

 16:11 <ahasenack> hm

 16:11 <ahasenack> that is the one the doc team mentioned to me

 16:11 <dpb1> cpaelzer: will add that one too

 16:11 <dpb1> good idea

 16:11 <ahasenack> that they were waiting for before publishing a new server guide relase

 16:12 <ahasenack> with my samba/ldap/kerberos fixes

 16:12 <ahasenack> so dpb1 is blocking my fixes from landing! :)

 16:12 <cpaelzer> I remember the reply ahasenack

 16:12 <dpb1> ahasenack: you want to take it?

 16:12 <cpaelzer> but they are unrelated - doc about kernel upgrades vs samba fixes

 16:12 <cpaelzer> should not block each other right?

 16:12 <ahasenack> indeed, they just wanted to take the opportunity

 16:13 <ahasenack> ah, it was the /boot being filled up controversy?

 16:13 <cpaelzer> yes

 16:13 <ahasenack> what exactly are we supposed to do there?

 16:13 <cpaelzer> so get your doc changes landed is #1

 16:13 <ahasenack> document best practices?

 16:13 <cpaelzer> and #2 is unrelated which is dpb1 taking care to clarify on these kernel things

 16:13 <cpaelzer> I'll carry the action, then we can talk about doc ok ahasenack

 16:14 <ahasenack> ok

 16:14 <cpaelzer> #ACTION: dpb to look into a few open issues around automatic updates that were pointed out by the doc team (carried over, into sprint)

 16:14 * meetingology : dpb to look into a few open issues around automatic updates that were pointed out by the doc team (carried over, into sprint)

 16:14 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: do you want to wait for the open discussion with the doc things?

 16:14 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: but I'm fine here if you want

 16:14 <ahasenack> what's next?

 16:15 <ahasenack> let's do it in the open discussion section

 16:15 <cpaelzer> Dev Release -> bugs -> sru- kernel -> open discussion

 16:15 <cpaelzer> ok

 16:15 <cpaelzer> #topic Artful Development

 16:15 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/ReleaseSchedule

 16:15 <cpaelzer> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-aa-server-core

 16:16 <cpaelzer> on merges I heard nacc is power-farming merges

 16:16 <cpaelzer> thanks a lot nacc

 16:16 <cpaelzer> anything on the general Artful before going into artful bugs?

 16:16 <teward> yeah i have work to do on nginx

 16:16 <teward> merging from Debian by hand

 16:16 <ahasenack> the merge report is now up-to-date, right?

 16:16 <teward> but that'll be done by end-of-week

 16:16 <ahasenack> I mean, it's running

 16:17 <ahasenack> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/merges.html ?

 16:17 <ahasenack> imagemagick is server?

 16:17 <cpaelzer> rbasak updated it and it generates things with recent updates

 16:17 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: I think it is tied to php

 16:17 <ahasenack> ah, could be

 16:18 <ahasenack> I might try some of the simpler ones, and related to services I know

 16:19 <cpaelzer> yeah doing most before the Debian release will be wise

 16:19 <cpaelzer> as after Debian releases all weird experiments will land and be sorted out

 16:19 <cpaelzer> merging then might be more stressful than intended

 16:19 <cpaelzer> a cycle later things will have settled a bit

 16:20 <cpaelzer> there are excuses like myself with qemu/libvirt intentionally waiting until the new versions appear after the release

 16:20 <cpaelzer> anyway going on to bugs in AA

 16:20 <cpaelzer> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:20 <cpaelzer> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:20 <ahasenack> hey, that list has gone down :)

 16:20 <cpaelzer> nish is on the merge assigned so I consider that handled

 16:21 <cpaelzer> sosreport is assigned to the reporter

 16:21 <nacc> cpaelzer: django?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> is that STS driven?

 16:21 <nacc> cpaelzer: yeah, i'm waiting for confirmation from openstack still

 16:21 <cpaelzer> nacc: yeah django

 16:21 <ahasenack> how is that cloud-init one fix committed but the artful task is not?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> nacc: you are on it which is enough to know it is not forgotten

 16:21 <ahasenack> isn't the main task == artful at this time?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> rharper: ^^?

 16:22 <ahasenack> https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1692028

 16:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1692028 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Artful) "duplicate mac address during config-drive configuration with LXD container on openstack" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:22 <ahasenack> ah

 16:22 <ahasenack> committed is upstream/code

 16:22 <cpaelzer> I think if it is an ubuntu owned thing then Devel and Artful can differ

 16:22 <ahasenack> package task is separate

 16:22 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: see upstream vs "status tracked in artful"

 16:22 <ahasenack> right

 16:22 <cpaelzer> exactly

 16:22 <ahasenack> I missed that

 16:22 <ahasenack> n/m

 16:22 <cpaelzer> slashd: hey is the sosreport from STS?

 16:23 <cpaelzer> David Coronel is assigned to all of them

 16:23 <cpaelzer> and the reporter

 16:23 <cpaelzer> well if he is around he can share in the next section since the bug goes back to all other releases as well

 16:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1677329 in samba (Ubuntu Zesty) "libpam-winbind: unable to dlopen" [High,In progress]

 16:24 <cpaelzer> and while waiting any other SRUs worth to mention completed or inthe pipe?

 16:24 <cpaelzer> I completed libvirt (apparmor rules) last week

 16:24 <cpaelzer> also postrges MRE fully passed X,Y,Z

 16:25 <cpaelzer> Trusty was accepted late, so it has to wait a few days in proposed - but test sare good

 16:25 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: what is it that you need on that one ahasenack?

 16:25 <ahasenack> cpaelzer: sponsorship for artful

 16:26 <ahasenack> and then I can proceed with sru'ing it to the other releases where it just doesn't work

 16:26 <ahasenack> I have a ppa with the fix for people to test: https://launchpad.net/~ahasenack/+archive/ubuntu/samba-1677329/+packages

 16:26 <ahasenack> builds with the appropriate ~ppa1 suffix ;)

 16:26 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: I need to tell you about bileto on the sprint

 16:27 <ahasenack> do tell

 16:27 <cpaelzer> which would make this a one-button action

 16:27 <cpaelzer> it is a repetition for the others so not on the agenda, but please remind me

 16:27 <cpaelzer> nacc: you did samba things in the past - could you sponsor the upload ?

 16:28 <nacc> cpaelzer: i can -- isa it ready to sponsor?

 16:28 <nacc> reading the backscroll

 16:28 <nacc> ahasenack: ping me in #ubuntu-server after this and i'll review it

 16:28 <cpaelzer> nacc: it is, if you want it in a different way then let ahasenack know

 16:28 <ahasenack> ok, thanks

 16:29 <cpaelzer> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:29 <cpaelzer> copy and paste please

 16:29 <powersj> Last week involved getting the initial collection metrics setup and into Prometheus. Also started on the proposed automation testing and was able to get a jenkins job setup with nightly checks for uploads and determine what tests, if any, need to be ran.

 16:29 <powersj> This week the focus is on getting cloud-init/curtin CI pipeline setup to extend our merge request testing past unit tests and include integration, build, etc. testing. Also hoping to get my proposed automation testing further working to demo next week.

 16:30 <powersj> #info continue work on proposed automation testing

 16:30 <powersj> questions?

 16:30 <cpaelzer> proposed automation testing is based on https://launchpad.net/qa-regression-testing right?

 16:30 <powersj> cpaelzer: ys

 16:30 <powersj> yes*

 16:30 <cpaelzer> just as my qemu/libvirt tests

 16:30 <cpaelzer> nice

 16:30 <cpaelzer> I used more of them looking forward to discuss and help in case

 16:30 <cpaelzer> e.g. strongswan I used

 16:31 <cpaelzer> interested how you wrapped that to work in jenkins

 16:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://launchpad.net/qa-regression-testing

 16:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:31 <smb> No news (those are said to be the good ones I hear). Are there questions/remarks/requests?

 16:32 <ahasenack> smb: do we carry a big apparmor delta regarding the upstream kernel?

 16:33 <smb> ahasenack, it can vary but I can tell from the top of my head how big that is in each kernel

 16:33 <ahasenack> ok

 16:33 <cpaelzer> thanks smb, I assume s/can/can't/ above

 16:34 <cpaelzer> otherwise I'd be extra impressed

 16:34 <ahasenack> same :)

 16:34 <smb> indeed

 16:34 <cpaelzer> 1

 16:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:35 <cpaelzer> we sprint internally next week as you have seen on some actions we moved there

 16:35 <cpaelzer> anything on top we should consider/discuss there?

 16:35 <cpaelzer> silence = no

 16:35 <cpaelzer> #topic Open Discussion

 16:35 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: could you outline the doc thing you wanted to discuss

 16:35 <cpaelzer> I remember the discussion about 3 weeks ago

 16:35 <ahasenack> ah, right

 16:36 <cpaelzer> you wanted to get stuff into serverguide (and I read you have/are on the way)

 16:36 <ahasenack> so tl;dr, I merged many fixes to the serverguide

 16:36 <ahasenack> and that's ready for release/publishing

 16:36 <cpaelzer> ok thats is a +1 for you

 16:36 <cpaelzer> \o/

 16:36 <ahasenack> the doc team then told me they will proceed with that, but first they wanted to check on something about unattended upgrades that was brought up elsewhere

 16:36 <ahasenack> (not by me)

 16:37 <ahasenack> and I didn't remembe that, until I saw that action here before

 16:37 <cpaelzer> hrm - still sounds as one should not block th eother

 16:37 <cpaelzer> was that update on the merge proposal?

 16:37 <ahasenack> no

 16:37 <ahasenack> the MPs have all been merged

 16:37 <cpaelzer> ah you mean before the point release they want to check

 16:37 <ahasenack> it was brought up in ubuntu-doc, in the reply to my publishing request

 16:37 <ahasenack> right

 16:37 <ahasenack> they wanted to try to include those changes in the point release as well

 16:37 <cpaelzer> maybe they have another change in flight which they'd like to include

 16:37 <cpaelzer> ah ok, now things make sense

 16:38 <ahasenack> and after seeing that action item

 16:38 <cpaelzer> do you happen to know if that is (or not) related to this kernel cleanup thing which is a task for dpb1?

 16:38 <ahasenack> I wondered if we were blocking that for them

 16:38 <cpaelzer> ok, so wondering not knowing if it IS the same item

 16:38 <ahasenack> I *think* it is related, but it's vague to me

 16:38 <cpaelzer> ok, dpb1 on that item could you do a few prechecks before next week so we know what to do onthat?

 16:38 <cpaelzer> part of the action you already have

 16:39 <ahasenack> I can paste the reply here

 16:39 <cpaelzer> yeah please

 16:39 <ahasenack> paste incoming (short)

 16:39 <ahasenack> "However, over on the Ubuntu-server e-mail list and meeting reports there was some stuff

 16:39 <ahasenack> about getting help addressing the unattended upgrades issues, and someone took the action

 16:39 <ahasenack> item. I'm going to try to kick that list and get some help, towards the objective of

 16:39 <ahasenack> including those fixes in this same point release cycle. So, there will be a delay before

 16:39 <ahasenack> string freeze is declared for this point release cycle."

 16:39 <dpb1> cpaelzer: I might not have time this week.

 16:39 <ahasenack> might that "someone" be dpb1?

 16:39 <cpaelzer> ok, ahasenack is next week early enough?

 16:39 <cpaelzer> I guess yes

 16:39 <ahasenack> sure
