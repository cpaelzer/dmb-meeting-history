 16:08 <ahasenack> not from me

 16:08 <teward> a manual nginx merge will happen, from Debian Experimental, but from their now-superseded 1.12.0 packaging.  That's in the works, manual merges are painful

 16:08 <teward> other than that, nothing.

 16:09 <teward> (yes I am actually quite alive heh)

 16:09 <nacc> teward: thanks

 16:09 <nacc> #info manual nginx merge (teward) with Debian experimental will happen

 16:12 <ahasenack> the ssh one has been there for quite a while

 16:12 <nacc> xnox is working that one, so probably fine :)

 16:12 <ahasenack> oh well, not nearly as long as the others, ok :)

 16:13 <nacc> i think we can move on

 16:13 <nacc> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd)

 16:13 <xnox> nacc, ?

 16:13 <slashd> STS bug: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24587628/

 16:13 <slashd> Addtional infos :

 16:13 <slashd> - I'm working on a ebtables bug (userspace). We, STS, made a fix, but it seems like ebtables is unmaintained upstream now. Nowadays all devel is happening in nft so I'll try to make the change commited/uploaded in Debian and then start the SRU.

 16:13 <nacc> xnox: oh some z bug (LP: #1686618) that is on the server qa report

 16:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1686618 in openssh (Ubuntu Artful) "ssh connection attempts fail if hw crypto support on s390x is enabled on 17.04" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1686618

 16:13 <slashd> #info SRU pending for : sssd, nfs-utils, qemu, ebtables

 16:13 <xnox> nacc, yeah, awaiting on upstream.

 16:14 <nacc> xnox: thanks

 16:14 <nacc> slashd: anything else to bring up?

 16:15 <slashd> nacc, no everything is under control

 16:15 <nacc> slashd: great, thank!
