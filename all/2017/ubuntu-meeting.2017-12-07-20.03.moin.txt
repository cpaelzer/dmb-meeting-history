 20:03 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Dec  7 20:03:57 2017 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:04 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:04 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:04 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:04 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:04 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:05 <Kilos> evening everyone

 20:05 <pleia2> welcome powersj!

 20:05 <Wild_Man> hello Kilos

 20:05 <Kilos> hi powersj

 20:05 <powersj> howdy

 20:05 <Wild_Man> #topic powersj

 20:06 <powersj> Does that mean I'm up? :)

 20:06 <pleia2> it does :)

 20:06 <powersj> wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/powersj

 20:06 <Wild_Man> powersj, please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:06 <powersj> I work on the Canonical Server team as the QA engineer. I swap my time between the cloud-init and curtin development team where I work on the testing and quality of those projects and the Server team where I work on bug triage, SRUs, git-ubuntu, and general distribution test efforts.

 20:06 <powersj> LP: https://launchpad.net/~powersj

 20:07 <wxl> wow pictures and everything!

 20:07 <pleia2> powersj: ah nice, you worked on HLinux for HPE, did you make it to the DebConf in Portland by any chance?

 20:07 <powersj> :)

 20:07 <pleia2> (I was over in the OpenStack team)

 20:07 <powersj> I did not :(

 20:08 <pleia2> shame, we probably haven't met then

 20:08 <powersj> I was at next year's at Heidelberg where I presented on hlinux

 20:08 <powersj> and this years in Montreal where I presented on cloud-init

 20:08 <pleia2> cool

 20:09 <pleia2> I see you're doing Ubuntu Server ISO testing, are you using the ISO tracker?

 20:09 <blackboxsw> heh,just found power's video from debconf http://saimei.ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/debian-meetings/2017/debconf17/cloud-init-building-clouds-one-linux-box.vp9.webm

 20:10 <powersj> I use when we do formal Alpha and Beta and Release tests, day to day I do not

 20:10 * pleia2 nods

 20:10 <powersj> blackboxsw: :)

 20:10 <pleia2> it could use some love, I'm always looking for an in on how to get improvements made ;)

 20:10 <wxl> is there someone on the team who does it daily?

 20:11 <powersj> wxl: I care for automated tests that gate the promotion of the amd64, i386, ppc64el daily server ISO. I try to check it daily to make sure no issues come up and if they do file bugs, pull in the right people, re-run tests, etc.

 20:12 <powersj> This way we know the current daily server ISO is actually tested and working and if it is not getting promoted from pending to current then something is wrong.

 20:12 <pleia2> that's good to hear

 20:12 <wxl> powersj: excuse my ignorance but does that deal with automated installation tasks, or just make sure that the builds work?

 20:13 <powersj> wxl: The test that gates promotion from pending to current does a preseeded install with the default options, so it won't check all the tasks, but some of them. After the default test, we launch a dozen more tests that check various tasks like mail server, lxd, etc.

 20:20 <Kilos> welcome to u bunt members powersj

 20:20 <powersj> thank you all!

 20:21 <wxl> powersj: hey before you go.. where's that jenkins instance running at? is that a canonical thing?

 20:21 <Wild_Man> You earned it

 20:21 <powersj> wxl: sadly the automated ISO tests are inside canonical, I am trying to get some more hardware for the public server jenkins (https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/) and get those moved over

 20:21 <powersj> should happen in January or February

 20:22 <pleia2> thanks for all your work powersj, and welcome :)

 20:22 <powersj> want more public help and viewing of ISO tests :)

 20:22 <powersj> pleia2: thank you

 20:22 <wxl> powersj: i guess what i'm thinking is whether or not that jenkins instance could be something other flavors could make use of

 20:22 <powersj> wxl: to block promotion of dailies?
