 15:15 <bdmurray> a wee bit ago caribou made some changes to the unattended-upgrades systemd shutdwon unit and it seems they work on Y and Z but not X

 15:15 <cyphermox> ah?

 15:15 <bdmurray> I need to confirm but it should be all the same code so I suspect something w/ systemd on X

 15:15 <cyphermox> yeah, seems like it should just work

 15:16 <bdmurray> I'll test again to confirm but may need some help.

 15:16 <cyphermox> I'm thinking we might need to think of some way to massage meeting output to those reports that need to happen

 15:16 <cyphermox> bdmurray: I'll be happy to help testing, I think my X230 is on xenial right now

 15:17 <cyphermox> AOB: going once, going twice...

 15:17 <xnox> bdmurray, ouch.

 15:17 <bdmurray> thanks, testing is easy in some vms I have. Its just if its not u-u I don't know where to look.

 15:18 <cyphermox> bdmurray: systemd in X is not quite as solid as in Y or Z, if experience with networkd is a good meter to the rest
