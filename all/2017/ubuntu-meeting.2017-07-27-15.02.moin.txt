 15:07 <gaughen> cyphermox, is it worth including in the dev summary as something that's coming?

 15:18 <bdmurray> So bug 1647638 I think we can take that off of incoming

 15:19 <bdmurray> I ran into bug 1706168 this week and wanted to talk about it

 15:19 <ubottu> bug 1706168 in update-notifier (Ubuntu) "dialog shouldn't be display if Command doesn't exist" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1706168

 15:20 <xnox> also i planned to tag rls-aa-incomming https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nplan/+bug/1706869 but i have misspelled the tag

 15:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1706869 in nplan (Ubuntu) "ADT tests fail on i386 only in artful-proposed with new util-linux" [Undecided,New]

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: I saw that bug report when you filed it, it seemed a straightforward improvement

 15:22 <bdmurray> slangasek: is it worth targetting for this release though? How many things use update-notifier hooks?

 15:22 <slangasek> I am unsure

 15:23 <slangasek> only a handful

 15:23 <xnox> msftcorefonts installer thing?

 15:23 * xnox ponders that msftcorefonts should be a snap

 15:23 <slangasek> $ ls -l /var/lib/update-notifier/user.d/firefox-restart-required

 15:23 <slangasek> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 444 Mar 24  2011 /var/lib/update-notifier/user.d/firefox-restart-required

 15:23 <slangasek> I seem to have some old stuff there

 15:25 <slangasek> bdmurray: I think the impact is probably not high enough to target for this cycle

 15:25 <slangasek> at least as I understand the impact

 15:25 <bdmurray> slangasek: The result kind of sucks, but I don't think many people will hit it.

 15:26 <bdmurray> slangasek: Also apt-file really should be fixed to clean up the hook.

 15:26 <slangasek> yes, agreed

 15:26 <bdmurray> I'll remove the tag from the update-notifier bug.

 15:29 <slangasek> bug #1706869, cyphermox will take a look

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1706869 in nplan (Ubuntu) "ADT tests fail on i386 only in artful-proposed with new util-linux" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1706869

 15:44 <slangasek> I'm not sure this is currently high priority for 17.10, but there's a patch

 15:45 <rcj> There's a patch that looks decent.

 15:45 <bdmurray> So somebody should just do it?

 15:45 <slangasek> yeah

 15:46 <rcj> Not sure about defaulting to 2017-06-09 (or something) as the date if it can't figure anything out.  Epoch 0 is a better flag to say clock-is-wrong

 15:46 <bdmurray> Not it

 15:46 <slangasek> I don't think it needs to be in our committed queue however, I think it should be sponsorship queue

 15:46 <slangasek> yes

 15:47 <xnox> slangasek, i thought the hybrid stuff was fixed.

 15:47 <xnox> as in i blacklisted the test =)

 15:48 <Odd_Bloke> Why does the rls-aa-notfixing page not have counts in the header for each team like the other pages do?

 15:49 <bdmurray> Why do you care?

 15:49 <slangasek> counts of things we've declined seem less interesting

 15:49 <Odd_Bloke> bdmurray: I'm idly writing a KPI script. :p

 15:50 <bdmurray> Odd_Bloke: they should be tagged rls-z-notfixingeverver

 15:50 <bdmurray> Odd_Bloke: so searchTasks with tag and package_subscriber(?)=foundations-bugs
