 15:18 <slangasek> rbalint:

 15:18 <tdaitx> slangasek, planned for tomorrow

 15:18 <chiluk> tdaitx the rtl8812au seems like something that should get really fixed and not just worked around.

 15:20 <bdmurray> irc discussion with moon127 regarding PS4 swift storage (dump it!)

 15:21 <bdmurray> ✔ done

 15:21 <tdaitx> bdmurray, yeah, it's on my todo list, what do I need to do there exactly?

 15:21 <gaughen> bdmurray, I just looked at your blog on Tuesday!

 15:21 <bdmurray> tdaitx: copy what I did in artful ;-)

 15:21 <slangasek> any questions over status?

 15:22 <tdaitx> chiluk, I need to take a deeper look into that, since the rtl works on the command line or wicd, but not on nm

 15:22 <chiluk> yeah tdaitx.. a LOT of people are hitting nm issues lately

 15:22 <tdaitx> bdmurray, k, tks

 15:22 <chiluk> every laptop I own right now has weirdness.

 15:22 <chiluk> I think it may even be timing related.

 15:23 <chiluk> as in nm-applet coming up before network-manager or the driver are ready

 15:23 <bdmurray> tdaitx: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/323195476/whoopsie_0.2.55_0.2.56.diff.gz

 15:23 <chiluk> I'll add some status as well since at least xnox used to care about intel-microcode

 15:23 <chiluk> lp#1700373 - intel-microcode - backported 20170511 to x, y, then discovered intel released 20170707 over the weekend.  Then backported 20170707 for SRU in x,y,z. Tested said backport, created public PPA for additional testing.  SRU currently waiting in Upload queue for x, y, z.

 15:23 <chiluk> lp1673481 - Completed verification of y and z.

 15:24 <tdaitx> bdmurray, in case I get the openjdk update before whoopsie, the only problem is that we won't get that field uploaded right?

 15:24 <bdmurray> tdaitx: right that field won't make it into errors but the rest of the report will and the whole thing would land in LP

 15:24 <xnox> ## Highlight: systemd 234 released upstream with contributions from Canonical for persistent interface naming of the ACPI platform devices, relevant on ARM64

 15:25 <sil2100> chiluk: I didn't find time to review the intel-microcode SRU yet

 15:25 <sil2100> Oh

 15:25 <sil2100> Ok

 15:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bug queue

 15:26 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:27 <slangasek> bdmurray: we did try to review this last week while you were out, and nothing moved

 15:27 <slangasek> I don't remember why this one critical is lingering in incoming

 15:28 <bdmurray> slangasek: because a community member made it critical w/o much justification

 15:28 <tdaitx> chiluk, when you quit you missed sil2100's comment: <sil2100> chiluk: I didn't find time to review the intel-microcode SRU yet

 15:28 <sil2100> Ah, chiluk is back!

 15:28 <sil2100> tdaitx: thanks ;)

 15:28 <slangasek> bdmurray: ah, cough

 15:28 <chiluk> sil2100: ... not back... but now part of the community

 15:28 <sil2100> chiluk: if other SRU members won't find cycles for the review I might pick it up tomorrow

 15:28 <chiluk> yeah sil2100.. I'm ok with us being a little slow on it.

 15:29 <chiluk> although from all my testing the microcode update seems to be fairly specific to only kabylake and skylake-e/x

 15:30 <bdmurray> I don't think there are many new things in rls-aa-incoming

 15:30 <chiluk> sil2100... Indeed has given me 40% time to make sure that Ubuntu continues to work as their development environment... and do some platform enablement.

 15:32 <slangasek> ok, 1646739 dispatched (marked as a duplicate)

 15:34 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything else on there worth looking at?

 15:34 <bdmurray> slangasek: not today

 15:34 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:36 <slangasek> Anything else?
