 16:45 <jdstrand> Stefan Bader (smb) provided a precise package for xen

 16:46 <jdstrand> Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:46 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:46 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:47 <jdstrand> this morning I finally managed to have no open items in the hr system (ie, perf reviews are done)

 16:47 <jdstrand> so this week I'll help with apparmor testing and landing

 16:47 <jdstrand> I'm on triage

 16:47 <jdstrand> and I have a bunch of pending updates (openjdk, openstack)

 16:48 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:48 <mdeslaur> I'm currently publishing some updates

 16:48 <mdeslaur> and have more pending

 16:48 <mdeslaur> and will be going down the list some more...I want to clear out the list as much as possible before I go on vacation on the 20th

 16:48 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 16:49 <mdeslaur> am currently sponsoring an update for Riddell

 16:49 <mdeslaur> that's about it

 16:49 <mdeslaur> sbeattie isn't here...who's after him? tyhicks?

 16:49 <tyhicks> I think so

 16:49 <jdstrand> yes

 16:49 <tyhicks> I'm still plugging away at the versioned parser patches

 16:50 <tyhicks> after thinking about what will be needed to do it from kernel postinst, I realized that I need to make some changes

 16:50 <tyhicks> however, I'm about to put that aside and do a few updates to the apparmor Ubuntu package in prep for landing the abstract socket changes

 16:50 <mdeslaur> \o/

 16:50 <tyhicks> (we've gathered a few small changes, in addition to abstract socket mediation, that we wanted to lump into the same update)

 16:51 <tyhicks> if I have any extra time, there have been a few ecryptfs-utils bugs that should get some attention

 16:51 * jdstrand wouldn't count on extra time this particular week

 16:51 <jdstrand> :)

 16:52 <tyhicks> agreed :)

 16:52 <jdstrand> maybe friday :)

 16:52 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:52 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:53 <jjohansen> I will be pulling my hair out,^W^W^W^W err working on apparmor abstract socket mediation this week

 16:53 <jjohansen> the latest iteration of the kernel is in the usual place, http://people.canonical.com/~jj/linux-image-3.15.0-6-generic_3.15.0-6.95+jj_amd64.deb

 16:54 <jjohansen> and another iteration is building

 16:54 <jjohansen> I still have a few changes to the parser to finish up to match the latest kernel as out of band transitions will not land with this

 16:55 <jjohansen> I expect to be iterating, this stuff and testing and helping with policy until we land this mess

 16:56 * jjohansen is in the process of getting the kernel patch together for sarnold, and anyone else who wants to gouge their eyes out

 16:57 <jjohansen> and the parser patches will follow later today

 16:58 * sarnold passes around the mellon ballers

 16:59 <jjohansen> that is it for me, sarnold your up

 17:00 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week, I've got some outstanding MIR reviews and another merge from tvoss for trust store to review -- presumably some apparmor patches to review too :) I suspect the apparmor patches alone would be enough to fill the week

 17:01 <jjohansen> sarnold: I'm glab you can call this your happy place ;)

 17:01 <sarnold> jjohansen: heh, compared to 70-odd CVEs to triage, it feels pretty happy :)

 17:02 <sarnold> tvoss's C++ is like reading urdu poetry -- I know it's beautiful but I just can't understand the language :D

 17:02 <sarnold> anyway, that's me, chrisccoulson?

 17:02 <jdstrand> sarnold: hehe

 17:03 <chrisccoulson> so, good news! I tested chromium 36 this morning

 17:03 <chrisccoulson> the bad news is that it crashes at startup on precise

 17:04 <mdeslaur> \o/...oh wait, /o\

 17:04 <chrisccoulson> so, at some point, that will be going out (once chad has fixed it)

 17:04 <chrisccoulson> I've also got some reviews to do for oxide

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> other than that, I'll be working through my RTM bugs

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> that's me done :)

 17:05 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: anything big for rtm?

 17:06 <jdstrand> re 36> \o/

 17:06 <jdstrand> :P

 17:07 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, https://bugs.launchpad.net/oxide/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&field.tag=rtm14

 17:07 <chrisccoulson> some of those need dropping off there actually

 17:08 <mdeslaur> ah, so just a couple of minor things I see :)

 17:08 <mdeslaur> </j>

 17:09 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: feel free to remove the rtm14 tag from the medium ones

 17:09 <chrisccoulson> sure, will do

 17:10 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: the way that critical and high are being handled is critical means we can't ship without it, high is we really want to ship with it but can provide an ota update

 17:10 <chrisccoulson> yeah, that makes sense

 17:10 <jdstrand> not sure the current priorities match that. might be worth discussing in the next oxide meeting

 17:11 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 17:11 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 17:12 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 17:12 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 17:12 <tangim> is there any kdeconnect allernative for unity??

 17:13 <jdstrand> tangim: I think you might want #ubuntu-user

 17:14 <tangim> umm...i don't know diffrence between ubuntu-meeting, ubuntu-on-air and ubuntu-user :(

 17:14 <jdstrand> tangim: see the /topic for each. this is a place where teams have meetings, not a general support forum

 17:15 <tangim> oh...thanks :)
