 16:32 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:32 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:33 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:33 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:33 <jdstrand> I plan to focus on apparmor: taking up tyhicks' work, policy updates (abstractions, system, click), testing and ultimately, landing

 16:34 <jdstrand> I'm keeping an eye on the openstack point release for trusty

 16:34 <jdstrand> and I'm working with foundations (eg, bhuey) on the pending openjdk-7 security update

 16:34 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'm on triae this week....although I'm off on vacation on wednesday, so it's a short week for me...someone will have to take over triage

 16:35 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: sarnold and I will handle that

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on an openssl regression on lucid, that exposed a bug in postfix...postfix is now fixed, and I'm going to publish a regression fix for openssl on lucid this afternoon

 16:36 <mdeslaur> and I'll monitor any last minute updates I can possibly work on before I go on holiday

 16:36 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it for me, sbeattie you're up

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor this week.

 16:37 <sbeattie> I'm reviewing jjohansen's abstract socket patches and testing the kernel to help out landing that.

 16:38 <sbeattie> That's pretty much it for me. tyhicks is not here...

 16:38 <sbeattie> jjohansen: you're up.

 16:39 <jjohansen> I am working on revising and landing the abstract socket mediation

 16:39 <jjohansen> I will also be helping tyhicks with anything he needs for LSS

 16:40 <jjohansen> I think thats it for me, sarnold you're up

 16:41 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: why don't you go first

 16:42 <jdstrand> s/first/now/

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> this week, I'm focusing on bug 1214034

 16:42 <ubottu> bug 1214034 in webbrowser-app "Implement API for querying SSL status and certificate information and signalling SSL errors to the embedder" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1214034

 16:43 <jdstrand> oh nice

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> I'm also expecting a chromium update from chad, and I have an oxide update to publish too

 16:44 <jdstrand> securty update?

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> it is

 16:44 <jdstrand> is that 1.1?

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> not yet, it's still 1.0

 16:45 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: does that mean we are still pulling down new chromium content api into 1.0?

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> the 1.0 update is the one that goes with chromium 36.0.1985.143

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> (see http://omahaproxy.appspot.com/)

 16:46 <jdstrand> so, I guess that is a 'yes' :)

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> yeah :)

 16:46 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: curious, when do we expect 1.1 in trusty?

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> that was driven by the flash update, but there's other fixes in it too

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> 1.1 is probably in another couple of weeks

 16:46 * jdstrand is guessing backporting to both is taking some time

 16:47 <jdstrand> ackporting isn't the right word

 16:47 <jdstrand> refreshing for both

 16:47 <jdstrand> cool

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done :)

 16:48 <jdstrand> sarnold doesn't seem to be present, so I'll move along

 16:48 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:49 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:51 <sarnold> sorry I'm late. I'm on community this week. I'm finishing a review of some apparmor patches and still have two outstanding MIR audits
