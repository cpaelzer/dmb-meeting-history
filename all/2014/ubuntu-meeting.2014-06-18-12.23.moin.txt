 12:23 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for June 18, 2014.

 12:23 <jared> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:23 <jared> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:23 <jared> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:23 <jared> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:24 <jared> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:24 <jared> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:24 <jared> #voters jared micahg cyphermox Destine

 12:24 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine cyphermox jared micahg

 12:24 <jared> Now, without any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:24 <jared> #topic Charles Butler's application

 12:24 <jared> lazyPower: can you please introduce yourself to the board while they read over your application

 12:25 <jared> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LazyPower

 12:25 <lazyPower> Hello, I'm Charles Butler. I've been a long time Ubuntu user, and fairly active in the community at large mainly in IRC and AskUbuntu.

 12:26 <lazyPower> I've been talking with an Ubuntu Member - Jose whom I'm sure all of you know, and he was the prime supporter in the filing of my application. I love the work we are doing and the community. My strongest area of contributions has been the emerging Cloud Orchestration division of Juju

 12:27 <lazyPower> I present myself to the board as I am, and hope you vote for me.

 12:28 <jared> If any of the other board members have any questions please jump in

 12:28 <jared> If anyone is here to cheer in person for lazyPower's application now is the time

 12:28 <micahg> lazyPower: you mention wanting to introduce new life into the PA loco, any plans for that?

 12:29 <jose> ello

 12:29 <lazyPower> micahg: I've been talking to the existing members and meetings have kind of dwindled. I'm proposing a motion to the list for virtual hangouts - a la UDS/UOS style to make it more accessible to people outside of the Philly region (as i'm in pittsburgh)

 12:30 <lazyPower> Also to provide some focused sessions over some of the newer cloud / touch/ friday hacklabs type projects to expose the emerging ubuntu tech to fellow members of the LOCO

 12:30 <jared> lazyPower: there have been a few posts to the loco-contacts mailing list about that recently that might help you with that goal of virtual hangouts

 12:31 <lazyPower> jared: Thanks for the tip. I'll take a look after the meeting.

 12:31 <jared> lazyPower: no point reinventing the wheel, learning from others makes life easier.

 12:32 <micahg> lazyPower: that sounds interesting (hangouts for LoCo)

 12:32 <jared> jose: if you have anything to add other than your testimonial feel free to jump in now

 12:32 <lazyPower> micahg: I'm really interested in making it very accessible to any/all who are interested without fragmenting the LOCO itself. Its a great group of people.

 12:33 <micahg> lazyPower: I'd be interested in hearing how that goes, maybe we could try something similar in Chicago

 12:34 * jedijf cheers for lazyPower and combining PA's east and west and then squeezing the middle

 12:34 <jedijf> nad welcomes any and all help :)

 12:34 <lazyPower> micahg: if this gets traction, we could definately collaborate on some bigger and shinier projects. Because "We have the technology!"

 12:35 <jared> So without further ado we'll conduct the vote

 12:35 <jared> #vote lazyPower for Ubuntu Membership

 12:35 <meetingology> Please vote on: lazyPower for Ubuntu Membership

 12:35 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1/-1/+0 #channelname)

 12:36 <lazyPower> Thank you! I'm honoured.

 12:36 <cyphermox> congrats lazyPower

 12:37 <jedijf> congrats lazyPower

 12:37 <jose> looks like my messages weren't sent but I wanted to just highlight the work that lazyPower has been doing

 12:37 <jose> congratulations, lazyPower

 12:37 <jared> jose: no problems, the testimonials on the application were great

 12:37 <jedijf> lazyPower: also, can't wait to 'hang'

 12:38 <lazyPower> jedijf: Likewise :)

 12:38 <cyphermox> lazyPower: you should be able to add your blog to planet.ubuntu.com, I'm sure people could benefit from more entries about juju things

 12:39 <lazyPower> With regard to the benefits of Ubuntu membership - such as adding my blog and the @ubuntu alias - are there instructions that are sent out or do i need ot dive deeper into the wiki?

 12:39 <cyphermox> the wiki has everything as I recall

 12:40 <jose> @ubuntu is automatic and planet is on the wiki, yes

 12:40 <meetingology> jose: Error: "ubuntu" is not a valid command.

 12:40 <lazyPower> brilliant. Thanks again everyone. I'm humbled and honoured to be accepted.

 12:41 <jared> #endmeeting
