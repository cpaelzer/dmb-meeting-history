 15:03 <jodh> - cgroup support:

 15:03 <jodh> - Finished reworking test_job_process async test suite. However,

 15:03 <jodh> test_job so currently identifying the issue and fixing up the tests.

 15:03 <jodh> - Currently working with xnox to clean up the branch and identify

 15:03 <jodh> fix the remaining tests.

 15:06 <barry> wheels ftw!

 15:07 <mvo> barry: :)

 15:07 <doko> mvo is the new ev

 15:07 <mvo> doko: *cough* I hope that is something positive

 15:08 <slangasek> barry: hurray! death to python2 and all it stands for!

 15:08 <slangasek> (or something?)

 15:08 <slangasek> stgraber is also at the cloud sprint

 15:08 <slangasek> so, cjwatson

 15:08 <xnox> doko: not quite, it's still under 200 lines.... unless mvo is only getting started =)

 15:09 <cjwatson> livefs in LP:

 15:09 <cjwatson> - Continuing work on the browser code.  This is almost entirely done now although not yet pushed anywhere; I still need to finish writing test code.

 15:09 <cjwatson> - Set up a local buildd slave so that I could do a straight-through test.  This was (eventually) successful, but in the process I discovered a small but important bug in the launchpad-buildd code, so we'll need to roll out a fix for that.

 15:09 <cjwatson> - Worked through William's initial review of https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/launchpad/livefs/+merge/217261.

 15:09 <cjwatson> - To do: finish browser tests, reviews/QA/deployment, cdimage changes.

 15:12 <xnox> ..

 15:13 <xnox> cjwatson: seems pretty much everyone was eager to get that in debian as well. thus the upload restricting to add gpl v2+ compat turned around quickly.

 15:14 <cjwatson> People aren't so keen on old crypto code right now

 15:14 <mvo> heh

 15:14 <doko> - two days off

 15:14 <doko> - sent GCC 4.9 ftbfs issues

 15:14 <doko> - updating gcc-4.8 before the 4.8.3 release candidate

 15:14 <doko> - fix more python3.4 autopkg tests

 15:14 <doko> - got involved into the ensurepip wheel packaging

 15:14 <doko> - start looking at the proposal for the openjdk-8 packaging.

 15:14 <doko> (done)

 15:15 <slangasek> and no caribou today, it seems?

 15:15 <mvo> french holiday I think

 15:15 <slangasek> ah yes

 15:15 <mvo> (or on strike)

 15:16 <slangasek> aren't those the same thing? :)

 15:16 <mvo> lol

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] DebConf planning

 15:18 <slangasek> if I've already approved you to attend DebConf, please register for the conference (as a professional attendee): http://debconf14.debconf.org/registration.xhtml

 15:18 <slangasek> don't register yourself for food/accommodation, which we should handle centrally

 15:19 <slangasek> and if you're not sure if you're approved to attend, come talk to me :)

 15:19 <slangasek> I'll get an event code into the system ASAP so you can start submitting your travel requests too

 15:20 <doko> does this mean we won't have lunch together with the other participants?

 15:20 <cjwatson> err

 15:20 <slangasek> however, we still need to settle which dates everyone will be in attendance

 15:20 <cjwatson> I already registered myself for food/accommodation

 15:20 <cjwatson> I think I missed that memo

 15:20 <slangasek> cjwatson: yes, the memo is late, you get an exception ;P

 15:20 <cjwatson> should I try to unwind my registration?

 15:20 <slangasek> doko: no, it means that you should not register yourself for lunch because that makes it more difficult for the company to pay

 15:21 <slangasek> cjwatson: don't worry about it until I have a chance to talk to Michelle

 15:21 <cjwatson> ok

 15:21 <barry> slangasek: and that always goes so smoothly with our usa travel agent :)

 15:22 <slangasek> so we'll hopefully have the DebConf schedule fleshed out more in the next week or so, at which point we'll talk about which dates it makes most sense for people to attend ... assuming not everyone is going to attend for all 10 days

 15:22 <xnox> also ESTA approvals

 15:23 <slangasek> barry: in this case, PSU asks for payment at time of registration for the room, so that makes it easier for msm to just pay it :)

 15:23 <barry> slangasek: \o/

 15:24 <slangasek> any other questions?

 15:24 <barry> ah, you can't fill out the travel auth until there's an event code

 15:24 <slangasek> right

 15:25 <cjwatson> FWIW PSU only asked me for time-of-registration payment for food

 15:25 <cjwatson> that is, the bill consisted entirely of 4x 10x breakfast+lunch

 15:26 <slangasek> oh, interesting

 15:26 <cjwatson> whether that's an error on their part I don't know

 15:26 <slangasek> well, something else for me to bother them about :)

 15:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:27 <slangasek> anything else to discuss?

 15:27 <slangasek> everybody getting ready for Malta?

 15:27 * mvo nods

 15:28 <slangasek> does anyone here happen to know how to accept ubuntu-core-dev's invitation to https://launchpad.net/~phablet-team ?

 15:28 <slangasek> the team has no admins; I asked bdmurray whether the DMB got an email about it and he said no

 15:29 <xnox> slangasek: i think you need an admin, in the owners team?

 15:29 <xnox> slangasek: https://launchpad.net/~pspmteam/+members ?

 15:30 <popey> slangasek: i just tried to manually add but it failed, because its already been invited

 15:30 <slangasek> xnox: the invite has been sent by the admin of phablet-team, but someone has to accept it on behalf of ubuntu-core-dev

 15:30 <slangasek> and I don't know who that "someone" can be

 15:30 <xnox> slangasek: oh.

 15:30 <slangasek> maybe an option shows up in the UI for the members of the DMB?  barry, bdmurray?

 15:30 <bdmurray> what is the structure of the url invite?

 15:30 * barry is no longer dmb

 15:30 <slangasek> oh

 15:30 * xnox is

 15:31 <slangasek> right

 15:31 <xnox> oh, since i'm a member of phablet-team already, i can't add one of my teams to it?!

 15:31 <slangasek> xnox, popey, bdmurray: shall we adjourn and try to figure this out on #ubuntu-devel then?

 15:31 <slangasek> (anything else from anyone?)

 15:32 <doko> yep

 15:32 <bdmurray> https://launchpad.net/~phablet-team/+member/ubuntu-core-dev maybe that

 15:32 <xnox> no allowed here

 15:32 <doko> trying to prepare for GCC 4.9, planning to make it the default in Malta

 15:33 <popey> "Ubuntu Core Development Team (ubuntu-core-dev) has been invited to join this team, but hasn't responded to the invitation yet."

 15:33 <slangasek> I think you should make it the default everywhere, not just in Malta

 15:33 <popey> (when I click that link)

 15:33 <bdmurray> ah, I got it

 15:33 <bdmurray> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/+invitation/phablet-team

 15:33 <doko> there are a number of issues now filed for Debian; I don't want to repeat the bug filing here in Ubuntu

 15:33 <doko> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=ftbfs-gcc-4.9;users=debian-gcc@lists.debian.org

 15:34 <slangasek> doko: 94 is still a lot. is anyone driving down the bug list in Debian?  Will gcc-4.9 be made the default in Debian soon?

 15:34 <doko> can we do a 5 a week bug squash until Malta?

 15:35 <doko> slangasek, see the email to -release, and the refusal on the qt related ones to work on anything else before 4.9 is the default

 15:36 <slangasek> doko: link to the -release mail?

 15:36 <slangasek> these are certainly NMU candidates in Debian; perhaps you'd like to announce a "bugsquashing party" in Debian and drive them down there, before making the switch of default in either Debian or Ubuntu

 15:37 <slangasek> we certainly want to make sure the Qt packages are fixed in Ubuntu before we make the switch, so that we're not hampering the touch work

 15:37 <doko> yes, announcement will follow for ubuntu

 15:38 <xnox> bdmurray: accepted.

 15:38 <xnox> slangasek: ^

 15:38 <slangasek> xnox: yay!

 15:39 <bdmurray> well, now I could have clicked the button I was trying to say look I found it

 15:39 <xnox> slangasek: i hope this does not translate into spamming core-devs.... =)

 15:39 <slangasek> doko: anyway, I think it's best to coordinate this with Debian, and where possible to do the fixes there directly via bugsquash NMU

 15:39 <slangasek> xnox: I'm pretty sure ubuntu-core-dev mail is already bitbucketed :)

 15:40 <cjwatson> ubuntu-core-dev has an e-mail address yet

 15:40 <cjwatson> *set

 15:40 <xnox> slangasek: archived neatly in /dev/null ?! =)))))

 15:40 <slangasek> billgates@bugone.com

 15:40 <cjwatson> So it should at worst only spam  ubuntu-core-reviews@lists.ubuntu.com

 15:40 <xnox> anyway... gcc-4.9 transition bug fixing needed. ok.

 15:41 <slangasek> alright, sounds like that's everything then

 15:41 <slangasek> #endmeeting
