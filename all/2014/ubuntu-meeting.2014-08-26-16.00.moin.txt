 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Aug 26 16:00:39 2014 UTC.  The chair is gnuoy. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:00 <meetingology>

 16:00 <matsubara> o/

 16:00 <gnuoy> Welcome all to the Ubuntu Server Team Meeting. Please shout if I stray from the correct path as this is my first time chairing one of these.

 16:01 <gnuoy> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <gaughen> gnuoy, just so you know, matsubara holds the world record for fastest mtg.

 16:01 <gnuoy> smoser to review coreycb mp for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openstack-trove/+bug/1347567

 16:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1347567 in openstack-trove (Ubuntu Utopic) "trove unit tests disabled" [High,In progress]

 16:01 <gnuoy> Looks like zul reviewed

 16:01 <coreycb> o/

 16:01 <zul> indeed

 16:01 <gnuoy> bug 1355891 (aka bug 1350522)  still needs looking at I think

 16:01 <smoser> thank you zul

 16:01 <ubottu> bug 1355891 in linux (Ubuntu) "crash on utopic ec2 instance" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1355891

 16:01 <ubottu> bug 1350522 in linux (Ubuntu Utopic) "EC2 kernel crash due to vmalloc" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1350522

 16:01 <gnuoy> smoser ^ ?

 16:01 <smb> I should have marked that as duplicate

 16:02 <smb> Pretty sure it is the same as bug 1350522

 16:02 <ubottu> bug 1350522 in linux (Ubuntu Utopic) "EC2 kernel crash due to vmalloc" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1350522

 16:02 <gnuoy> ok, I'll leave it with you

 16:02 <gnuoy> #topic Utopic Development

 16:02 <gnuoy> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseSchedule

 16:03 <gnuoy> Thursday was FeatureFreeze

 16:03 <smb> smoser, btw, I got a work-around patch applied to utopic today. So at least pv guests should work until I figure out the real fix

 16:03 <smoser> k.

 16:04 <gnuoy> Anyone got anythin else to add with regard to the release schedule before we look at release bugs?

 16:05 <kickinz1> o/

 16:05 <gnuoy> Hmm, I wonder if we lost some config on the way which has contributed to/caused 1361357

 16:05 <gnuoy> s/some config/some network config on serverstack/

 16:06 <smoser> gnuoy, after i went down a rathole... i suspected network.

 16:06 <gnuoy> smoser, mtu settings had been tweaked and they didn't persist after a reboot

 16:07 <gnuoy> other settings could have gone I guess

 16:07 <smoser> i'd really hope that isnt it.

 16:07 <smoser> we can talk more outside this meeting.

 16:07 <gnuoy> ack

 16:07 <smoser> and i will make sure to bother you

 16:07 <gnuoy> thanks!

 16:08 <gnuoy> 1360471 seems unloved. What do we normally do there?

 16:08 <hallyn> bug 1360471

 16:08 <ubottu> bug 1360471 in walinuxagent (Ubuntu Utopic) "update walinuxagent to 2.0.7" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1360471

 16:08 * gaughen opens bug

 16:08 * gaughen waits for system

 16:10 <gaughen> smoser, would we need to get an FFE for this package?

 16:10 <smoser> we would normally bother utlemming on that. and let him do what he needs to do.

 16:10 <gaughen> this package = walinuxagent

 16:10 <smoser> i'll bother him

 16:10 <gaughen> gnuoy, put me down for bugging utlemming

 16:10 <zul> yeah i have something to add

 16:11 <gnuoy> #action gaughen bug utlemming about bug 1360471

 16:11 * meetingology gaughen bug utlemming about bug 1360471

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1360471 in walinuxagent (Ubuntu Utopic) "update walinuxagent to 2.0.7" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1360471

 16:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1361737 in Ubuntu "[ffe] New dependency for openstack python-oslo.utils" [High,New]

 16:11 * utlemming shows up late

 16:12 <gnuoy> zul, ok, looks like package update o'clock

 16:12 <zul> gaughen:  also an archive admin havent reviewed python-lxc or openstack-granite either

 16:13 <gnuoy> Is the normal form here to twiddle thumbs until someone leaps up and grabs the bug?

 16:14 <gaughen> zul, do you have the bug #s for those handy? else I'll find them and go looking for an admin

 16:14 <zul> gaughen:  nope it was done before the FF though

 16:17 <gnuoy> #action gaughen find archive admin to  review  python-lxc and openstack-granite

 16:17 * meetingology gaughen find archive admin to  review  python-lxc and openstack-granite

 16:17 <gnuoy> I'm going to move onwards and upwards

 16:18 <gnuoy> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:18 <gnuoy> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-u/group/topic-u-server.html

 16:18 <gnuoy> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-u-server

 16:18 <gaughen> I think blueprints need some love

 16:18 <gaughen> although I do think smoser's are current

 16:19 <gaughen> gnuoy, that's all I have to say. move along.

 16:19 * smoser looks

 16:19 <gnuoy> will do

 16:19 <gnuoy> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:19 <caribou> gnuoy: everything is fine from my end, thanks

 16:20 <gnuoy> caribou, ta

 16:20 <gnuoy> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:20 <psivaa> no update is from us this week :)

 16:20 <gnuoy> psivaa, ta

 16:21 <gnuoy> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:21 <smb> I am trying to not go completely bonkers while reading xen/x86 bootup code mangling pagetables around. Not sure how successful. :-P Is there anything else I/we should be aware or have a look at?

 16:21 <kickinz1> what is the current status of virtio+bcache?

 16:21 <arges> kickinz1: hey

 16:22 <arges> kickinz1: i've found the patch that causes the regression. I also created a test patch that I'm asking for some review. I'll probably post that on the upstream ML soon

 16:22 <kickinz1> arges: cool, thanks.

 16:23 <gnuoy> smb, not that I know of, anyone else ?

 16:23 <arges> kickinz1: are there any other kernel issues you've found in your bcache testing? If so please ping me

 16:24 <gnuoy> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:24 <kickinz1> arges: not for now (hung tasks messages + virtio), I'll ping you if some new.

 16:25 <gnuoy> This one confuses me a little. What are we trying to achieve with this section? Is it making people aware of events they might like to attend?

 16:25 <gnuoy> or "Please say this when you're there?"

 16:26 <rharper> gnuoy: I always assumed it was to mention up coming events that the team was involved in ...

 16:26 <gnuoy> to what end?

 16:26 <rharper> other folks might be going to those as well and might meet up?

 16:26 <gnuoy> kk

 16:26 <rharper> gnuoy: dunno, I'm too noob here to know, smoser might

 16:27 <gnuoy> I shall take silence to mean everyone is staying home

 16:27 <gnuoy> #topic Open Discussion

 16:27 <gnuoy> Anything anyone wants to openly discuss?

 16:28 <gnuoy> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:28 <gnuoy> next meeting will be : Tue Sept 2 16:00:00 UTC 2014

 16:28 <smoser> i think gnuoy 's understanding of the intent of "upcoming events" was correct.

 16:28 <smoser> basically discuss upcoming "cloud" like events.

 16:28 <smoser> that you might want to attend.

 16:28 <gnuoy> ack, thanks

 16:28 <smoser> or that people are attending. or

 16:29 <smoser> or someone might say "Oh, i can meet *the* rharper if I go to cloudwhizbangconf in WrigleyVille?  I'm so there!"

 16:29 <gnuoy> I AM so there!

 16:30 <gnuoy> (if he brings homebrew)

 16:30 <gnuoy> #endmeeting
