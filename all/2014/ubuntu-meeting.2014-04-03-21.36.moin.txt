 21:36 <iulian> #startmeeting 2200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 21:36 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Apr  3 21:36:08 2014 UTC.  The chair is iulian. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 21:36 <iulian> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for April 3, 2014.

 21:36 <iulian> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 21:36 <iulian> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 21:36 <iulian> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 21:37 <iulian> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 21:37 <iulian> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 21:37 <cjohnston> iulian: lets wait another 20 minutes :-)

 21:38 <mihir> Hi

 21:38 <iulian> Whoops.

 21:39 <mihir> Mihir

 21:40 <iulian> Hi there mihir. Apparently I got confused with the time. The meeting should start 20 minutes.

 21:40 <iulian> But if everyone's here, then I wouldn't mind to start earlier. :-)

 21:40 <iulian> RoozbehShafiee: Here?

 21:40 <RoozbehShafiee> Im here too

 21:40 <iulian> thomi: Here?

 21:40 <RoozbehShafiee> iulian: yes

 21:40 <thomi> iulian: yes

 21:40 <mihir> iulian, okay

 21:41 <iulian> cjohnston, Pendulum, hggdh: Do you guys mind if we start earlier? Everyone is present so I believe just waiting for another 20 minutes isn't going to make much of a difference.

 21:41 <cjohnston> iulian: we should give the candidates time to gather any supporters that they may have had coming to the meeting to support them

 21:42 <iulian> RoozbehShafiee, thomi, mihir: Would you like to start the meeting earlier? Are you guys ready?

 21:42 <iulian> Ah, right, sure.

 21:42 <mihir> iulian, yeah

 21:42 <RoozbehShafiee> iulian: yes Im ready :)

 21:42 <thomi> I'm happy either way

 21:46 <mihir> iulian, ?

 21:48 <iulian> We are just waiting for someone to reply.

 21:50 <mihir> iulian, okay.

 21:50 <hggdh> iulian: go for it

 21:52 <iulian> Okey dokey.

 22:04 <cjohnston> RoozbehShafiee: I noticed that you have no testimonials... we normally use testimonials as a way of getting to know the candidate and their contributions

 22:04 <RoozbehShafiee> cjohnston: I emailed to Daniel and Mehdi

 22:05 <RoozbehShafiee> cjohnston: but for persian new year Mehdi didnt answer me

 22:05 <RoozbehShafiee> unfortunately

 22:05 <iulian> Any more questions for RoozbehShafiee?

 22:05 <RoozbehShafiee> cjohnston: also it seems Daniel was not accessible

 22:05 <hggdh> RoozbehShafiee: so, the lack of visible *recent*, sustained contributions to Ubuntu, and lack of testimonials, make our task much more difficult

 22:07 <iulian> OK, if there are no more questions, then I believe it's time to vote.

 22:09 <iulian> RoozbehShafiee: Unfortunately, you have been unsuccessful this time. Please do keep up the good work that you are doing with the LoCo team. We are looking forward to reading your application next time you apply. We suggest that you re-apply in a few months. Also please talk to your friends and get some testimonials as they are really useful.

 22:10 <Pendulum> RoozbehShafiee: I agree with iulian. It looks like you've done good work, it's just not possible for us to really see what it is.

 22:10 <iulian> thomi: I believe you're up next. The stage is all yours.

 22:10 <RoozbehShafiee> iulian Pendulum: ok guys , no problem

 22:10 <thomi> cool

 22:11 <thomi> so, I'm Thomi Richards, my wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ThomiRichards - I currently reside in Dunedin, New Zealand

 22:11 <thomi> The wiki page contains most of the information you probably care about. To summarise...

 22:11 <thomi> I'm the principle author of Autopilot, which we use in our Ubuntu Touch & Desktop acceptance test suites. This is what I spend 90% of my day-to-day hacking time on.

 22:11 <RoozbehShafiee> Pendulum: maybe because I completed my wiki page in 4 days ago, I had not much time to find testimonials

 22:11 <thomi> I'm passionate about improving the quality of Ubuntu releases, and autopilot is one way I can do that. Right now we have dozens of high-profile projects using autopilot for their acceptance tests, and more coming online all the time.

 22:11 <thomi> I'm also a consumate hacker, I have code in dozens of Ubuntu packages and open source projects (to name a few: Ogre3D, crystalspace, blender3d, testtools, etc).

 22:11 <cjohnston> wait.. theres going to be more? :-/

 22:12 <thomi> In my spare time I advocate for Linux, open source, and Ubuntu in my local community. I've spoken at conferences (Kiwi PyCon mostly) representing Ubuntu (can link to video if anyone wants).

 22:12 <iulian> :-)

 22:12 <thomi> I was involved in helping organise Linux.conf.au waaaay back in 2006, where Mark Shuttleworth was a keynote speaker, talking about launchpad.

 22:12 <thomi> I work for Canonical, but have been using Linux for about 15 years now, and using Ubuntu since the good old days of Warty Warthog. I'm sure that if I ever stopped working for Canonical I'd still participate in Ubuntu.

 22:12 <thomi> Apart from all that, I'm 'thomir' almost everywhere on the Internet - I think my launchpad, github, ohloh, etc profiles speak for themselves.

 22:12 <thomi> </introduction>

 22:13 <cjohnston> Any questions for thomi ?

 22:13 <iulian> None from me.

 22:13 <popey> ooh

 22:13 <thomi> oh, there are some testamonials on my wiki page as well

 22:13 <popey> +1 from me

 22:13 <hggdh> none from me.

 22:13 <PabloRubianes> not for me

 22:13 <cjohnston> who woke up popey :-P

 22:13 <PabloRubianes> none*

 22:13 <hggdh> uhu, do I see popey crashing the party?

 22:13 <thomi> hi popey o/

 22:13 <popey> Didn't know thomi was up for membership!

 22:13 <hggdh> :-)

 22:14 <iulian> :-)

 22:14 <popey> thomi has bee instrumental in creating the quality of Ubuntu for some time.

 22:14 <cjohnston> popey had any good bacon and syrup recently :-)

 22:14 <popey> shush

 22:14 <hggdh> I have no questions for thomi, except why took him so long to apply...
