 22:05 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Feb  6 22:05:41 2014 UTC.  The chair is s-fox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:05 <s-fox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for February 6, 2014.

 22:06 <s-fox> oops, oh well...

 22:06 <IdleOne> 2200UTC

 22:06 <s-fox> i know :)

 22:06 <s-fox> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:06 <s-fox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:06 <s-fox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:06 <s-fox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:07 <s-fox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:07 <s-fox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:09 <s-fox> slickymaster:

 22:09 <belkinsa> You are not first, Luiscano.

 22:10 <s-fox> Luiscano:  please wait your turn.

 22:10 <IdleOne> Please wait for your name to be called :)

 22:10 <belkinsa> Err, sorry.

 22:10 <slickymaster> My name is David Pires, I am 45 years old, live in Porto, a fabulous city in the north of Portugal, and I work in a Portuguese government agency as a programmer, primarily in Java and SQL, since 1994.

 22:10 <s-fox> #subtopic slickymaster

 22:10 <slickymaster> ups

 22:10 <slickymaster> s-fox, is it alright for me to start?

 22:11 <s-fox> slickymaster: yes please!

 22:11 <slickymaster> My name is David Pires, I am 45 years old, live in Porto, a city in the north of Portugal, and I work in a Portuguese government agency as a programmer, primarily in Java and SQL, since 1994.

 22:11 <slickymaster> my launchpad id is https://launchpad.net/~slickymaster

 22:12 <slickymaster> my wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/slickymaster

 22:12 <slickymaster> I started using Linux by the time of Jaunty Jackalope release, in 2009, and since then I've tried several other Linux distributions such as Arch Linux, CentOS and Debian, but I always came back, one way or the other, to the one I feel more comfortable with, which is (X)Ubuntu

 22:13 <slickymaster> is there any thing else you'd think it could be relevant?

 22:13 <chilicuil> thanks for your good work on the qa team slickymaster, without looking deeper I think I'm ready to vote on this application

 22:13 <s-fox> i've seen your activity on the forums,  especially in programming talk!

 22:13 <s-fox> :)

 22:13 <knome> slickymaster has been contributing lately to xubuntu in QA and documentation, and has been very helpful.

 22:13 <slickymaster> that's a surprise s-fox

 22:13 <Unit193> I highly support slickymaster's application for membership.  He's been a wonderful help to Xubuntu docs and QA, always willing and eager to help, be it writing testcases for QA, or entire new sections in the docs!

 22:14 <knome> "lately" being... some time already :)

 22:14 * elfy only ever writes testimonials for people that deserve it, not much more I can say than what I already have, but it's the only time I remember actually turning up to a membership meeting for someone else

 22:14 <belkinsa> slickymaster is also amazing member of NewDocs and aways works with the other members to get things done in the team and the project.

 22:14 <knome> and yep, as i wrote in his wikipage, i will feel let down by the board if you don't approve him ;)

 22:14 <elfy> I said similar :)

 22:14 <knome> (well not as i wrote, but what i implied...)

 22:14 <belkinsa> I support slickymaster app myself.

 22:14 <Unit193> I didn't write on the wiki, but I was planning on it. >_>

 22:14 <s-fox> alright... lets get on with it then! :)

 22:15 * slickymaster bows thankfully to all those kind words

 23:07 <elacheche_anis> And we're preparing the UGH14.04
