 22:00 <belkinsa> Welcome to the 2200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board meeting.  Who is all for this meeting?

 22:00 <belkinsa> #voters s-fox belkinsa

 22:00 <meetingology> Current voters: belkinsa s-fox

 22:01 <belkinsa> Going once.

 22:03 <belkinsa> It seems that we might have to do it via the mailing-list.  Letozaf_, you already have +4, but we need one more to carry the montion.

 22:03 <belkinsa> motion*

 22:03 <Letozaf_> belkinsa, ok

 22:04 <s-fox> i'm sorry Letozaf_  :(

 22:04 <Letozaf_> s-fox, no matter

 22:04 <popey> hello all

 22:04 <belkinsa> We may have one coming.

 22:04 <belkinsa> #voters popey

 22:04 <meetingology> Current voters: belkinsa popey s-fox

 22:05 <Letozaf_> popey, o/

 22:05 <belkinsa> #voters cyphermox_

 22:05 <meetingology> Current voters: belkinsa cyphermox_ popey s-fox

 22:05 <popey> \o/ quorum

 22:05 <belkinsa> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:05 * Letozaf_ thanks everyone :)

 22:05 <belkinsa> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:05 <belkinsa> he format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:05 <belkinsa> The*

 22:05 <popey> oh hey Letozaf_ !

 22:06 <belkinsa> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:06 <Letozaf_> popey, hi

 22:06 <belkinsa> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:06 <belkinsa> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:06 <belkinsa> #voters PabloRubianes

 22:06 <meetingology> Current voters: PabloRubianes belkinsa cyphermox_ popey s-fox

 22:06 <belkinsa> Letozaf_, are you ready?

 22:06 <Letozaf_> belkinsa, yes

 22:07 <Letozaf_> Hello, My Name is Carla Sella (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CarlaSella). I live in northern Italy near Venice and I'm a System Administrator in the IT Department of a firm in Schio a little city.

 22:07 <Letozaf_> I am not so lucky to have many Linux servers where I work but I am a Linux enthusiast.

 22:07 <Letozaf_> I have had the fortune to participate UDS-R as Nichoalas Skaggs encouraged me to apply for sponsorship and to start collaborting with him on testing, I am currently member of Ubuntu Quality Team, Ubuntu Core Apps Test Writers and I enjoy writing autopilot tests for  Ubuntu Phone Core Apps.

 22:07 <Letozaf_> It would be an honor to be part of the Ubuntu Comunity.

 22:07 <popey> Check out those testimonials!

 22:07 <cyphermox_> yeah, very nice

 22:07 <popey> That's something to be proud of right there.

 22:09 <cyphermox_> I think Letozaf_might actually be responsible for some of the funnest bugs I've had to deal with

 22:09 <Letozaf_> popey, thank you

 22:09 <cyphermox_> by responsible, I mean filing the bug reports

 22:10 <belkinsa> Carp.

 22:10 <s-fox> #vote $foo

 22:10 <belkinsa> cyphermox_, go a head.

 22:10 <cyphermox_> Letozaf_: how has COBOL programming affected your mental health? ;)

 22:10 <popey> I think whatever the bot says, it's pretty clear the result of the vote.

 22:10 <balloons> sorry Letozaf_ I stepped away for a second

 22:10 <s-fox> :)

 22:11 <Letozaf_> cyphermox_, well I must say that now days it's crazy just to think to program in COBOL :P

 22:11 <Letozaf_> balloons, hello

 22:11 <cyphermox_> popey: should we restart the vote to have a clear trail or just deal with the textual logs?

 22:11 <balloons> I didn't know you did COBOL Letozaf_.. me too :-)

 22:11 <popey> I wouldn't. The channel is clearly logged.

 22:11 <cyphermox_> yes

 22:11 <Letozaf_> balloons, well I wouldn't suggest to use it :P

 22:11 <balloons> lol

 22:11 <cyphermox_> it's just harder to read this way, but this vote is a clear approval

 22:12 <belkinsa> Thanks cyphermox_.

 22:12 <cyphermox_> well, congrats Letozaf_!

 22:12 <popey> yeah. congratulations Letozaf_ !
