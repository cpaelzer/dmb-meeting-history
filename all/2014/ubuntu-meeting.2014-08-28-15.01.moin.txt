 15:01 <stgraber> #topic Round table

 15:02 <stgraber> since I'm ready anyway, I'll start

 15:02 <stgraber> I was in Chicago last week (Tuesday to Saturday):

 15:02 <stgraber> - Presented user namespaces at the Linux Security Summit with hallyn

 15:02 <stgraber> - Gave a talk on running your own Internet at LinuxCon North America

 15:02 <stgraber> - Ran a container hackfest on the Friday

 15:02 <stgraber> 

 15:02 <stgraber> Serge and I had a lot of good discussions with various kernel and userspace

 15:02 <stgraber> developers around container security, userspace improvement and new use cases.

 15:02 <stgraber> I also found the time to attend a few talks on other container projects (we had

 15:02 <stgraber> a whole track dedicated to containers this time around) and some other topics I

 15:02 <stgraber> had an interest into like btrfs.

 15:02 <stgraber> 

 15:02 <stgraber> During some of the spare time and the hackfest, we mostly focused on:

 15:02 <stgraber> - Kernel and userspace fixes/workarounds for a recent regression introduced by

 15:02 <stgraber> the latest kernel security update (breaking nested unprivileged containers).

 15:02 <stgraber> - Some cgmanager debugging for random crashes and for a race on the phone.

 15:02 <stgraber> - Discussed the new LXC command line tool and worked on it a bit.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Started working on lxcfs, a fuse filesystem that exposes cpuinf, meminfo and

 15:03 <stgraber> stat with the values coming from the cgroup limits.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Started looking at cgmanagerfs, a fuse filesystem simulating the cgroup

 15:03 <stgraber> hierarchy based on what cgmanager tells it, allowing for safe unprivileged

 15:03 <stgraber> cgroup operations.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Unprivileged fuse mounts, Seth has been reworking his patchset.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Went through a bunch of upstream bug reports and fixed a bunch.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Discussed using seccomp as a way to catch mount() and do userspace handling

 15:03 <stgraber> of it (so we can do policy checks in userspace and fake mounts).

 15:03 <stgraber> - Granite (LXC for OpenStack) work, including a bunch of upstream changes to

 15:03 <stgraber> support unprivileged containers joining an openvswtich bridge.

 15:03 <stgraber> - Checkpoint and restart with CRIU, went through the patchset from tych0 a few

 15:03 <stgraber> times and eventually merged it upstream!

 15:03 <stgraber> - Had some chats with the Akamai, Heroku, Parallels, Docker.io and Google

 15:03 <stgraber> folks in attendance.

 15:03 <stgraber> 

 15:03 <stgraber> We had about 20 people attending the hackfest, a bunch from Canonical (Serge,

 15:03 <stgraber> Seth, Chuck, Tycho and myself), one from Akamai (our lxc-go maintainer), one

 15:03 <stgraber> from Heroku, a bunch from Google (3-4), a bunch from Docker (3-4), a couple

 15:03 <stgraber> from Parallels and a few other just dropping in here and there.

 15:03 <stgraber> 

 15:03 <stgraber> 

 15:04 <stgraber> After getting back, I've been doing:

 15:04 <stgraber> - Some more LXC cleanups, merges, reviews, ...

 15:04 <stgraber> - Setup system-image for Ubuntu RTM

 15:04 <stgraber> - Running 14.10 beta-1

 15:04 <stgraber> - Prepared and attended a whole bunch of LXC/container related meetings

 15:04 <stgraber> 

 15:04 <stgraber> Please note that I won't be around on Monday as it's labour day in the US and

 15:04 <stgraber> Canada and I'll also be without Internet since I'm doing a partial move (work

 15:04 <stgraber> equipment only) this weekend. I'll be working from my new place starting on

 15:04 <stgraber> Tuesday and then moving over there for good the Saturday after that.

 15:04 <stgraber>
