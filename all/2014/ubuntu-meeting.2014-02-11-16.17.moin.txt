 16:17 <arosales> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:17 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Feb 11 16:17:58 2014 UTC.  The chair is arosales. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:17 <meetingology> 

 16:17 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:18 <arosales> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:18 <arosales> I don't see any actions from the precious meeting listed on the wiki

 16:19 <arosales> #topic Trusty Development

 16:19 <arosales> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule

 16:19 <arosales> So we are coming up on Feature Freeze

 16:19 <arosales> an important milestone

 16:19 <arosales> Debian Import Freeze has passed

 16:19 <arosales> and Beta 1 freeze is at the end of the month on the 27th

 16:20 <arosales> for FF make sure folks are getting their packages uploaded

 16:20 <arosales> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:20 <arosales> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:21 <arosales> Looking at the high bugs we have 4

 16:21 * arosales will iterate though the high and any others folks ping with here

 16:21 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mod-auth-mysql/+bug/1243076

 16:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1243076 in mod-auth-mysql (Ubuntu Trusty) "libapache2-mod-auth-mysql is missing in 13.10 amd64" [High,Confirmed]

 16:22 <arosales> no one assigned yet.

 16:22 <arosales> jamespage, are you currently looking after mysql?

 16:23 <rharper> arosales: jamespage said he had to step out at the beginning

 16:24 <arosales> ah the  5 min has elapsed I thought I could catch him

 16:24 <arosales> any other folks interested in looking at mysql?

 16:25 <arosales> #action gaughen follow up with jamespage on bug 1243076

 16:25 * meetingology gaughen follow up with jamespage on bug 1243076

 16:25 <ubottu> bug 1243076 in mod-auth-mysql (Ubuntu Trusty) "libapache2-mod-auth-mysql is missing in 13.10 amd64" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1243076

 16:25 <arosales> thats right gaughen not off the hook ;-)

 16:25 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1248283

 16:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1248283 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "Juju deploy of Charm in MAAS fails because dbus fails" [High,Triaged]

 16:26 <arosales> dbus task still out

 16:26 <arosales> any folks able to take a look at the dbus task?

 16:26 <jamespage> back now

 16:27 <arosales> jamespage, bug 1243076

 16:27 <ubottu> bug 1243076 in mod-auth-mysql (Ubuntu Trusty) "libapache2-mod-auth-mysql is missing in 13.10 amd64" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1243076

 16:27 <arosales> dbus anyone?

 16:27 <arosales> I think serge and rbasak had commented on the bug . . .

 16:27 <arosales> hallyn, that is

 16:28 <arosales> #action gaughen follow up on dbus task for  bug 1248283

 16:28 * meetingology gaughen follow up on dbus task for  bug 1248283

 16:28 <ubottu> bug 1248283 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "Juju deploy of Charm in MAAS fails because dbus fails" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1248283

 16:28 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/horizon/+bug/1259166

 16:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1259166 in horizon (Ubuntu Trusty) "Fix lintian error" [High,Triaged]

 16:29 <arosales> may be a bug for zul to take a look at after the sprint

 16:29 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dovecot/+bug/1278897

 16:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1278897 in dovecot (Ubuntu Trusty) "dovecot warns about moved ssl certs on upgrade" [High,Triaged]

 16:29 <arosales> jamespage, looks you just triagged this one

 16:30 <arosales> jamespage, any comments here for dovecot?

 16:30 <jamespage> yeah - I was looking at that

 16:30 <rbasak> I see bug 1248283 as mainly a juju issue. The dbus issue would be low priority, maybe just for upstream. juju can just not do that, and then won't have a problem.

 16:30 <ubottu> bug 1248283 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "Juju deploy of Charm in MAAS fails because dbus fails" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1248283

 16:30 <jamespage> I think the prompt it not policy compliant - so its an easy fix

 16:31 <arosales> rbasak, can you comment in regards to dubs as it is confimred in that bug

 16:31 <arosales> rbasak, mark priority accordingly with the comment would be appreciated.

 16:31 <rbasak> arosales: I think my comment #17 already covers it

 16:31 <rbasak> I'll mark dbus low to make it clear though.

 16:31 <arosales> rbasak, importance still not set though

 16:32 <arosales> jamespage, ack on dovecot are you going to be delegating or taking a look?

 16:33 <arosales> #action jamespage to follow up on bug 1278897 (policy compliant)

 16:33 * meetingology jamespage to follow up on bug 1278897 (policy compliant)

 16:34 <ubottu> bug 1278897 in dovecot (Ubuntu Trusty) "dovecot warns about moved ssl certs on upgrade" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1278897

 16:34 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:34 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:34 <arosales> tread line is well off

 16:35 <jamespage> arosales, I'll deal with it

 16:35 <arosales> jamespage, thanks

 16:35 <jamespage> arosales, no to worried about the trend line tbh

 16:35 <arosales> jamespage, you feel ok with the highs that are at 0%

 16:38 <jamespage> yeah - we have some catchup todo

 16:38 <jamespage> but that bp is back loaded on the cycle so not to worried

 16:38 <arosales> jamespage, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-1311-ceph looks to be progressing but still in the red

 16:39 <jamespage> yeah - I'd hoped to have uploaded firefly by now but its delayed a bit

 16:39 * arosales just looking at the high/essential red-progress BPs

 16:39 <jamespage> at which point some of those WI go DONE

 16:39 <arosales> jamespage, thanks for the update

 16:39 <arosales> serue, thanks for the post

 16:39 <arosales> serue, if hallyn was around I would ping him on that

 16:40 <arosales> #action hallyn follow up on 1248283 from an lxc pov, ping serue to coordinate

 16:40 * meetingology hallyn follow up on 1248283 from an lxc pov, ping serue to coordinate

 16:40 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-1311-mysql-alternatives also in the red

 16:41 <arosales> #action smoser update cloud-init BP

 16:41 * meetingology smoser update cloud-init BP

 16:42 <arosales> those are the high/essential BPs in the red, any others folks want to bring up?

 16:42 <jamespage> mysql is progressing

 16:42 <jamespage> active/active option via percona xtradb cluster is in the NEW queue for trusty as of yesterday

 16:42 <jamespage> hope to get mysql-5.6 in the queue this week

 16:44 <arosales> jamespage, ah good to hear, thanks for the update

 16:44 <arosales> moving on

 16:44 <arosales> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:44 <caribou> arosales: nothing on my side this week, thanks

 16:44 <arosales> caribou, ok thanks

 16:45 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:45 <psivaa> Three types of failures:

 16:45 <psivaa> minimal install on amd64, reports about 5Mb more than it used to be

 16:45 <psivaa> test_mod_php failure on lamp server tests, i made an MP for the test to fix, that's awaiting server developers' approval

 16:45 <psivaa> test_tomcat_daemon failure due to lack of entropy

 16:45 <psivaa> sorry, hurriedly prepared list.

 16:46 <rbasak> I think the solution for entropy is just to give the test /dev/urandom instead.

 16:46 <psivaa> could somebody do that fix?

 16:47 <rbasak> If there is a bigger discussion to have around cloud instances and entropy, then perhaps that's a blueprint level discussion item, but no need to hold up tomcat

 16:47 <arosales> jamespage, you aware of minimal install gonig up on amd64?

 16:47 <rbasak> psivaa: where does the test come from? ie. where does it need to be fixed?

 16:47 <psivaa> rbasak: lp:ubuntu-test-cases/server

 16:47 <jamespage> arosales, no

 16:47 <jamespage> but I'm not going to worry about 5MB

 16:48 <arosales> jamespage, ack

 16:48 <psivaa> in that case we could increase the limit again in the server test cases

 16:48 <jamespage> psivaa, that's the first time this cycle right?

 16:48 <psivaa> rbasak: if you are working on that, could you do that also please. even if i do that it needs approval from you

 16:48 <psivaa> jamespage: yes

 16:49 <psivaa> started on 20140128 iirc

 16:49 <rbasak> psivaa: approved https://code.launchpad.net/~psivaa/ubuntu-test-cases/mod_php-fix/+merge/204273

 16:49 <rbasak> Do I need to do anything else?

 16:49 <rbasak> Like actually merge it? Or will a bot do that?

 16:49 <psivaa> rbasak: no you need to do that for this

 16:50 <psivaa> i dont think there is a bot for the server test cases. but jamespage might know more

 16:50 <jamespage> no bot

 16:51 <psivaa> that's all from me though :)

 16:52 <arosales> so 5mb increased ok with jamespage

 16:52 <arosales> mege acked by rbasak for lamp server tests

 16:52 <arosales> and rbasak suggested a fix for entropy on the tomcat tests

 16:52 <arosales> psivaa, thanks
