 12:15 <amjjawad> Hi everyone :)

 12:16 <amjjawad> amjjawad is my user name. My name is Ali

 12:16 <amjjawad> Glad to be here :)

 12:18 <popey> amjjawad: hiya, so there's a lot of stuff listed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/amjjawad

 12:18 <popey> amjjawad: What do you consider to be your primary focus?

 12:18 <amjjawad> popey, hello and yes indeed. That for 4 years :)

 12:18 <amjjawad> Ubuntu GNOME first, StartUbuntu second :) and Ubuntu Quality third

 12:19 <popey> You certainly have a lot of testimonials!

 12:19 <amjjawad> popey, I've been part of several project for 4 years

 12:19 <popey> What do you have planned for Ubuntu GNOME for the coming months?

 12:19 <amjjawad> Ubuntu Forums, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Ubuntu Quality, etc

 12:20 <amjjawad> I am the community manager/leader so I focus on building a strong community while Tim (the head dev) focus on the technical side

 12:20 <amjjawad> Every cycle, I introduce new changes to the project

 12:20 <amjjawad> shall I share some?

 12:21 <amjjawad> Ubuntu GNOME has many good stuff that no other community has :)

 12:21 <amjjawad> I have started last cycle a new sub-team for Human Resources :)

 12:22 <amjjawad> some (just some) of what I have done recently: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/GettingInvolved/Roles

 12:22 <amjjawad> and: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/CycleAssessment/UtopicUnicorn

 12:22 <popey> That's a lot of roles to fill!

 12:22 <amjjawad> By the way, it is me who created all this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/WikiMap

 12:22 <amjjawad> all these pages I mean

 12:22 <amjjawad> well, this is me :) my ambition has no limits :)

 12:23 <popey> Right, but finding people to contribute to all of that must be difficult?

 12:23 <amjjawad> I never give up. It is very hard indeed but I enjoy it a lot

 12:23 <amjjawad> I have recruited many people to Lubuntu for 2 years

 12:24 <amjjawad> I played a major part within Lubuntu in many areas

 12:24 <amjjawad> what I have achieved in Lubuntu in 2 years, I have done it with Ubuntu GNOME in 6 months

 12:24 <popey> What do you find most rewarding in Ubuntu?

 12:24 <amjjawad> with Lubuntu, things where there but I improved them

 12:25 <amjjawad> with Ubuntu GNOME, had to start from scratch

 12:25 <amjjawad> the sub-teams here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/SubTeams it is me who created that

 12:25 <amjjawad> it is the power of we

 12:25 <amjjawad> all of us are smarter than anyone of us

 12:25 <amjjawad> I do adore Ubuntu's Philosophy

 12:26 <amjjawad> This Philosophy will never fail :)

 12:26 <popey> Ok, I don't have any other questions. Anyone else?>
