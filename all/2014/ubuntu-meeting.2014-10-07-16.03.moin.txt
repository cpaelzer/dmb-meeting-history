 16:04 <lutostag> everyone was supposed to review blueprint work items before next weeks meeting

 16:04 <rharper> \o

 16:04 <lutostag> so if you havent done that, get to it nowish I guess

 16:04 <lutostag> no other action items from last week

 16:04 <lutostag> #topic Utopic Development

 16:05 <lutostag> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseSchedule

 16:05 <lutostag> so whats the state of things, are we frozen?

 16:06 <lutostag> Final Freeze is 9 days out

 16:06 <lutostag> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:07 <lutostag> well, before we do that, Im sure someone probably wants to say something about Utopic

 16:07 <lutostag> I know we still have some FTBFS packages, right rbasak? any high importance ones still outstanding?

 16:07 <rbasak> One moment

 16:08 <rbasak> http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-20140914-utopic.html#ubuntu-server

 16:08 <rbasak> jpds: are you still looking at the strongswan one?

 16:08 <jpds> rbasak: Yep.

 16:09 <rbasak> OK, thanks.

 16:09 <rbasak> Any help with these would be appreciated.

 16:09 <lutostag> rbasak: thanks, that looks better than I thought it was, do you need more resources or are we on track?

 16:09 <rbasak> I had been leaving them for the virtual sprints.

 16:09 <rbasak> But as we're coming up to final freeze I'll take a look.

 16:10 <lutostag> rbasak: alright, thanks!

 16:10 <jamespage> o/

 16:10 <jamespage> sorry late

 16:10 <lutostag> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:10 <lutostag> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-u-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:10 <lutostag> doesnt look like any High prio ones

 16:11 <lutostag> we've got our juju mirs and some openstacky things

 16:12 <lutostag> anything in that list we need that isnt being activelt pushed? something not there?

 16:12 <lutostag> actively*

 16:13 <lutostag> I guess we seem to be comfortable then.

 16:13 <lutostag> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:13 <lutostag> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-u/group/topic-u-server.html

 16:13 <lutostag> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-u-server

 16:14 <lutostag> (I just updated servercloud-u-maas moments ago, so that should be doing better)

 16:15 <lutostag> the other ones that look a little low are juno (zul) and curtin (smoser)

 16:15 <lutostag> who dont happen to be here right now

 16:15 <smoser> :)

 16:15 <smoser> i'm here. just quiet.

 16:15 <smoser> i'll llook at curtin.

 16:16 <lutostag> smoser: great, thanks

 16:16 <zul> ditto

 16:16 <lutostag> I guess thats it for Blueprints, get them to the current status and decide what needs to be postponed

 16:16 <zul> not curtin but the other stuff

 16:17 <lutostag> zul: gotcha

 16:17 <lutostag> or if you need more resources, now is the time to pester gaughen

 16:17 <lutostag> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:18 <arges> caribou is out this week btw

 16:18 <lutostag> ah, ok

 16:18 <lutostag> did anyone have anything important from last week to follow up on, if not moving on

 16:19 <lutostag> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:19 <lutostag> psivaa: floor is yours

 16:19 <psivaa> not much to report from us on the iso testing side

 16:19 <psivaa> lutostag: ^ :)

 16:20 <lutostag> so I read that as its going well

 16:20 <lutostag> psivaa: thanks!

 16:20 <psivaa> sure

 16:20 <lutostag> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:20 <smb> I would have nothing to bring up and am not aware of anything pending from our side. Please let me know if there is anything or if there are any questions.

 16:21 <kickinz1> smb, I reported some bugs on bcache, wa may need to speak about them

 16:21 <smb> kickinz1, If you could subswcribe me on them I would find them

 16:21 <kickinz1> ok

 16:21 <arges> kickinz1: is this the same bcache bug we looked at a while ago?

 16:22 <kickinz1> no

 16:22 <arges> ok

 16:22 <kickinz1> if you create a bcache devaice with caching device > backing, kernel crash (machine hangs)

 16:22 <kickinz1> and there is no way to completely destroy a bcache without rebooting.

 16:22 <arges> kickinz1: ok can you post the bug#?

 16:22 <kickinz1> I'll ping you later with the bugs numbers

 16:22 <kickinz1> ok

 16:22 <arges> ok

 16:23 <smb> kickinz1, or send a list to kernel-team mailing list

 16:23 <kickinz1> 1377130, 1377142

 16:23 <smb> that way we all get notified and have a record

 16:23 <kickinz1> ok I'll do

 16:24 <lutostag> great, if nobody has anything else...

 16:24 <arges> kickinz1: also to assist speedy debugging try using latest mainline kernels to help us narrow down the issue. I think joe's bot sends instructions on how to dot hat

 16:24 <arges> and i'm done...

 16:25 <lutostag> :)

 16:25 <lutostag> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:25 <lutostag> so ODS

 16:26 <lutostag> anything else we should be aware of?

 16:26 <lutostag> guess not

 16:27 <lutostag> #topic Open Discussion

 16:27 <lutostag> Anything else?

 16:28 <lutostag> #topic Announce next meeting date and time
