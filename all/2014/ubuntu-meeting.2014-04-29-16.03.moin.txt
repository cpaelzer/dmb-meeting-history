 16:06 <jamespage> syncs are happening from debian unstable; make sure you keep onto of any merges you did last as well

 16:06 <jamespage> rbasak, are you able to send round a merge update to nudge us all?

 16:07 <rbasak> jamespage: will do

 16:08 <jamespage> I know gaughen will be chasing everyone for blueprints!

 16:08 <jamespage> rbasak, thanks!

 16:08 <gaughen> jamespage, it's true! I have an email partially composed to nag folks. Creating the unicorn blueprints first

 16:08 <gaughen> so I give folks a place to move stuff

 16:08 <jamespage> after the lts releases conservative feature approach, feel free to make outlandish and streching objective for utopic

 16:09 <jamespage> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <jamespage> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:10 <jamespage> wow look at that - loads of bugs!

 16:10 * jamespage looks harder

 16:11 <jamespage> looks like kirkland is on a few byobu bugs

 16:11 <jamespage> I'll look at bug 1304135

 16:15 <caribou> I'll craft a blueprint on this one

 16:15 <jamespage> caribou, gnuoy or coreycb - any change either of you could help caribou out with the bug above?

 16:16 <jamespage> its a scalability thing
