 16:05 <gaughen> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:06 <gaughen> jamespage, zul there's a critical neutron bug bug # 1288696

 16:06 <gaughen> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1288696

 16:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1288696 in neutron (Ubuntu Trusty) "Unable to migrate from ovs to ml2 plugin" [Critical,Triaged]

 16:06 <jamespage> gaughen, yeah - the upstream script is almost ready - should make rc1

 16:07 <jamespage> (icehouse rc1)

 16:07 <zul> gaughen:  still being reviewed

 16:07 <gaughen> excellent

 16:07 <gaughen> okay next topic

 16:07 <gaughen> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:07 <gaughen> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:07 <gaughen> I've been impressed with how folks are keeping them up to date

 16:07 * gaughen looks at smoser pointedly

 16:07 <gaughen> I need to add a blueprint from the server readiness topic last week

 16:08 <smoser> yeah. i'm working.

 16:08 <smoser> thanks to everyone else who is keeping up.

 16:08 <gaughen> #action gaughen to create a blueprint from server readiness topic

 16:08 * meetingology gaughen to create a blueprint from server readiness topic

 16:08 <gaughen> hehe, just had to mess with you smoser ;-)

 16:08 <gaughen> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:08 <gaughen> hrmm, caribou isn't here

 16:09 <gaughen> so there must not be any bugs! moving on...

 16:09 <gaughen> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:09 <gaughen> psivaa, anything to discuss?

 16:09 <psivaa> not much from our side

 16:09 <jamespage> wow - that was fast

 16:09 <gaughen> cool

 16:09 <jamespage> gaughen, I had two things to headsup on in the trusty bit

 16:09 <gaughen> ooh

 16:09 <gaughen> sure

 16:10 <gaughen> what's up jamespage

 16:10 <jamespage> so first - ceph; the firefly release schedule has slipped and it looks like firefly won't be released until after 14.04 release date

 16:10 <jamespage> discussing that with SRU and release team at the moment

 16:11 <zul> couldnt we do the same thing we are doing for openstack for ceph?

 16:11 <jamespage> zul, we could - and that is one option; to push in the interim releases between now and firefly so the SRU in the end is minimal

 16:11 <jamespage> we already have a MRE - I thing we could swing that

 16:11 <jamespage> I'm going to discuss with sage upstream later

 16:12 <zul> jamespage:  yeah like a 0 day sru

 16:12 <gaughen> jamespage, this isn't the first slip though

 16:12 <gaughen> right?

 16:12 <jamespage> second; I declined to upload the 1.17.5 juju-core release to trusty as it drops the juju-mongodb support; sinzui is aware of this and is gating the next release on that being included

 16:12 <gaughen> so are we confident that they'll make this new date.

 16:12 <jamespage> gaughen, no - it was mean't to be early feb

 16:12 <gaughen> ?

 16:12 <gaughen> so, that worries me a bit, jamespage

 16:12 <jamespage> gaughen, both of those things worry me alot

 16:13 <jamespage> the first more than the second as I think the juju team will sort things this week

 16:13 <gaughen> jamespage, I hope sage can give you the warm fuzzy that it won't slip again

 16:13 <jamespage> gaughen, maybe :-)

 16:13 <jamespage> anyway - that's all I had to raise re trusty dev

 16:13 <gaughen> jamespage, anything else?

 16:13 <jamespage> oh - actually

 16:14 <jamespage> zul and I where discussing continued inclusion of savannah in trusty

 16:14 <gaughen> you mean, saraha now ;-)

 16:14 <jamespage> upstream just renamed for icehouse and the packaging is not 100% complete or tested

 16:14 <gaughen> sahara

 16:14 <jamespage> so we elected no to ship it

 16:14 <gaughen> any risk with doing that?

 16:14 <jamespage> we can re-introduce next cycle

 16:14 <jamespage> not in my opinion

 16:14 <zul> gaughen: no

 16:14 <jamespage> its not a core project

 16:15 <gaughen> excellent

 16:15 <zul> we already have hadoop dont we anyways?

 16:15 <gaughen> those packages are a bit dated.

 16:15 <gaughen> anyhow, moving along

 16:16 <gaughen> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:16 <smb> Not much right now, just a kind of warning that I am working on the FFE for Xen 4.4 after which maybe we should check how well that all works within OpenStack (via libvirt).

 16:16 <zul> smb:  are you just waiting for it to be uploaded now?

 16:16 <gaughen> excellent, thanks smb

 16:17 <smb> zul, Half that half on something that I recognize as a approval from the release tem

 16:17 <smb> team

 16:17 <zul> ack

 16:17 <zul> if you need someone to upload it lemme know

 16:17 <smb> zul, ok, will do

 16:17 <gaughen> cool, thanks zul, smb

 16:17 <smb> zul, ta

 16:18 <gaughen> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:18 <gaughen> rbasak, anything?

 16:18 <rbasak> No updates from me. Any questions?

 16:18 <gaughen> doesn't look like it. thanks rbasak

 16:18 <gaughen> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:19 <gaughen> not aware of any upcoming community events.

 16:19 <gaughen> last week was vUDS, watch the videos.

 16:19 <gaughen> #topic Open Discussion

 16:19 <gaughen> any other topics?

 16:19 <zul> yeah i should probably do that

 16:19 <gaughen> zul, yeah! you should!

 16:20 <gaughen> zul, jamespage tried to cover openstack :-)

 16:20 <gaughen> okay, no open discussion?

 16:20 <gaughen> 3

 16:20 <gaughen> 2

 16:20 <gaughen> 1

 16:20 <zul> heh...well dont schedule uds when im on vacation then

 16:20 <gaughen> lol

 16:20 <serue> yeah i'm sure that was an accident

 16:21 <gaughen> coincidence, total coincidence...... maybe ;-)

 16:21 <gaughen> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:21 <gaughen> next week - same bat time, same bat channel - March 25 at 16:00 UTC
