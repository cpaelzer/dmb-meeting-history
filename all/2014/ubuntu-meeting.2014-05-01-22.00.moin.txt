 22:00 <cjohnston> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1 May, 2014. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:00 <cjohnston> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:00 <cjohnston> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:00 <cjohnston> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:00 <cjohnston> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:01 <cjohnston> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively).

 22:01 <cjohnston> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:01 <cjohnston> dakira, please tell us about yourself

 22:03 <dakira> hi. I'm a computer science student from Hamburg, Germany. I entered the Ubuntu community around the time 5.04 was released (mostly the German community at that time). Currently I'm modding /r/ubuntu on reddit.

 22:04 <dakira> I try to get that community lined up with the rest of the Ubuntu community (especially regarding the CoD).

 22:05 <IdleOne> Call of Duty!

 22:05 <dakira> he ;)

 22:05 <IdleOne> dakira: I know the ubuntu-de community is fairly active. Did you ask any of them for testimonials?

 22:08 <dakira> IdleOne: no.. I didn't mainly because I'm currently mostly active on reddit (where nhaines suggested I should apply for membership). I wouldn't call myself "active" on launchpad, but I've been getting into packaging for some time now and had my first two "successes" for 14.04 (getting libimobiledevice up to date and fixing a bug in totem before release).

 22:09 <IdleOne> ok, thank you.

 22:09 <dakira> IdleOne: nhaines also gave me a testimonial for my work on reddit.

 22:10 <dakira> IdleOne: err.. I meant CoC (Code of Conduct).. ;)

 22:10 <IdleOne> yes I know :)

 22:16 <ratman> hi

 22:16 <ratman> I'm Alejandro Esperon, mi wiki es https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ratman/EN. My English is pretty bad so I hope you pardon me. If you took a little time is that I am translating.

 22:16 <IdleOne> dakira: please come back in 2-3 months with a few more testimonials

 22:16 <ratman> I live in montevideo uruguay.The wiki contains more information about myself, I am using linux since 2001 about through various distributions of the time, and I use ubuntu since 2006, approximately

 22:16 <ratman> Although I have participated in the events from which the group organised, since 2012 and I will be part of the Council LoCo Team Uruguay.

 22:16 <ratman> My major contribution in the group I think they have been on the side of the organization, attention ubuntu booth, and the photographic record thereof. While I have also participated in providing some workshops on the use and customization of ubuntu, Also realize installations on computers at events so when the occasion presents me to help someone

 22:17 <dakira> IdleOne: yeah, no worries. I didn't know I needed more than one. I'm pretty sure mhall and others would have written one, if I had asked them.

 22:22 <cjohnston> moving on... jsjgruber your up.. please introduce yourself

 22:22 <jsjgruber> I'm an old-time computer software guy--dangerous with either a screwdriver or hammer.

 22:22 <jsjgruber> My launchpad, askubuntu, and irc id's are jsjgruber. My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JohnSGruber.

 22:22 <jsjgruber> I like to diagnose and often patch software bugs (since 2008), and help people out.

 22:22 <jsjgruber> I've long been a Michigan LOCO member, (though I live in Ohio), I have earned +7000 reputation points on AskUbuntu (I'm less active there now than I was a couple years ago but I still get on occasionally, particularly to follow up on questions I'm asked on old answers and see if there are any new questions I can help with) I've been maintaining Lernid since 2011 and I think I've made it more robust. I've also added features

 22:22 <jsjgruber> to make it more useful.

 22:24 <PabloRubianes> jsjgruber, hi, how is your involvement with your LoCo?

 22:25 <jsjgruber> I've attended jams, I presented Lernid to a local use group, MUG, during a LOCO sponsored program. Many of the MUG members use Ubuntu.

 22:25 <jsjgruber> That was in 2011

 22:27 <PabloRubianes> ok jsjgruber

 22:28 <chilicuil> +1, I thank you for your work with lernid, with the upcoming google hangouts it seems it's been used less officially, but I it's been clearly a key software during the ubuntu classroom and ubuntu developer weeks
