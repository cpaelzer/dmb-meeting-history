 12:03 <iulian> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Sep 17 12:03:20 2014 UTC.  The chair is iulian. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 12:03 <meetingology>

 12:03 <iulian> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for September 17, 2014.

 12:03 <iulian> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:04 <iulian> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04 <iulian> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04 <iulian> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:04 <iulian> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:05 <iulian> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers amounts to at least +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:05 <iulian> #votesrequired 4

 12:05 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed

 12:06 <iulian> #voters marcoceppi jared Pendulum Destine rickspencer3 iulian

 12:06 <meetingology> Warning: Nick not in channel: rickspencer3

 12:06 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine Pendulum iulian jared marcoceppi rickspencer3

 12:07 <iulian> It appears that vovd is not here.

 12:07 <iulian> Should we wait a bit more or move on to the next applicant?

 12:07 <rickspencer3> o/ all

 12:07 <rickspencer3> here now

 12:08 <marcoceppi> iulian: should we see if they join at the end?

 12:08 <iulian> #subtopic tinoco

 12:08 <jared> I think we should probably look at removing Valentino from the wiki page, they've missed many meetings now

 12:08 <tinoco> o/

 12:08 <iulian> tinoco: Hi, the stage is all yours.

 12:09 <tinoco> Hello, my name is Rafael David Tinoco and I'm 32 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Tinoco & http://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaeltinoco/). I've been using Linux since I was 13 (started with Slackware and migrated to Debian and then Ubuntu). When I was 15, alternating between OLVWM and FVWM, I started reading all classical Unix books from Richard Stevens - Unix Networking Programming, Advanced Programming for Unix Environments, TCP/IP Illustrated 1/2 - and

 12:09 <tinoco> this made me to become passioned about Operating Systems and Computer Architecture. In the age of 16 I started to work on Internet providers infrastructure and I could have a good understanding about networking. I spent the next 4 years alternating between jobs in the ".com" era, studying physics and using the first video4linux versions to provide solutions on University of Sao Paulo Physics Lab (Holographic Interferometry).

 12:09 <tinoco> When 20 I've started working for Sun Microsystems and became SPARC/CMT/Solaris Internals specialist but this did not me put away from Linux since I got the chance to dedicate good amount of time to HPC with Linux + OFED + Infiniband, having projected/installed/configured the TOP #69 machine in the Linpack TOP #500 rank in 2009. After leaving Sun I worked on a company called Locaweb (biggest cloud provider in Brazil) in the Linux engineering

 12:09 <tinoco> team and one of my biggest achievements there was to create one connector + netlink taskstats daemon to measure resources consumption for cloud customers on over 1000 servers simultaneously. After that I spent sometime working for Red Hat as consultant/architect for their recent (at that time) KVM products but I got lucky to be called by IBM to enter in the Mainframe world.

 12:09 <tinoco> Next 3 years I spent learning System-z (s390, s390x) architecture, z/OS and z/VM concepts and, most important, Linux for System/z. I've implemented several Mainframes with Linux on huge Linux customers and I got so involved in the architecture (System/z) that IBM Linux on System z Lab, in Boeblingen, called me for a residency studying System-z NUMA effects on Linux scheduling decisions and to benchmark specific Mainframe milicode instructions

 12:09 <tinoco> observing the same NUMA effects (for instructions such as Hipersockets). Finally I got invited to work at Canonical as a Linux Engineer for the Sustaining Engineering Group - providing fixes to the community and customers in the Ubuntu Advantage program.

 12:09 <tinoco> Passioned about open-source and since my whole background is based on servers, different architectures/infrastructures and internals, my special interest is to help Ubuntu community in specific areas: providing fixes to userland and kernel areas related to Networking, Storage, Infiniband, Scalability, High Availability, like I've been doing for the last 6 months (Pacemaker, Corosync, Kernel Namespaces & Containers).

 12:12 <rickspencer3> hi tinoco

 12:12 <tinoco> Hello

 12:12 <rickspencer3> tinoco, so, that is a paste of your wiki page, I guess?

 12:13 <tinoco> rickspencer3: this is an introduction i just created for the channel. the wiki is a bit different saying things I've been contributing for the last months

 12:13 <iulian> tinoco: I can see that you aren't a member of any of the community teams. You've mentioned that you're dealing with kernel bugs and things related to it. Do you plan to join the bug squad or bug control teams in the near future?

 12:13 <tinoco> iulian: totally

 12:14 <iulian> I suppose it'd be a bit hard to do your job if you aren't in the bug control team.

 12:14 <tinoco> iulian: well today bugs are brought to my attention through Ubuntu Advantaged and from other teams as well (like Ubuntu Kernel Team)

 12:15 <iulian> tinoco: I'm very happy with the work you're doing but I would very much like to see more community involvement. Do you think you could work on that in the future?

 12:15 <tinoco> iulian: Thats my intention.

 12:16 <rickspencer3> tinoco, to build on what iulian asked,  you mentioned sponsoring in your wiki page, have you had any opportunities to help community members get fixes into Ubuntu?

 12:16 <tinoco> iulian: and the one thing I would say I need to "improve": to better understand community needs and way-of-work

 12:16 <tinoco> rickspencer3: yes. i've helped some other users to provide fixes for packages

 12:16 <tinoco> explaining about patching/packaging and giving examples on SRU way-of-do

 12:16 <Pendulum> tinoco: why do you want to be an Ubuntu Member?

 12:17 <tinoco> Pendulum: I was always passioned about Ubuntu and the community but I never had the opportunity im having right now to better help the community (several private contracts/work before)

 12:18 <tinoco> i would love to take the opportunity and starting to give back several things i used from community (and being using so far)

 12:20 <iulian> Thanks tinoco for your answers.

 12:20 <jared> Is there anyone here to cheer on tinoco that hasn't commented on the wiki application?

 12:21 <iulian> Any more questions for tinoco?

 12:21 <iulian> OK, let's vote then.

 12:24 <iulian> mbruzek: Hello. Could you please introduce yourself?

 12:24 <iulian> #subtopic mbruzek

 12:25 <mbruzek> Hello my name is Matthew Bruzek.  A long time Linux enthusiast who has been using Ubuntu for the past five years.  An active member of LInux User Group (http://k-lug.org) where I have given several technical presentations (and played disc golf with them last night!).  I am have created and presented a Linux Introduction class for the local Community Education department. Active with the local makerspace, where we use Ubunt

 12:25 <mbruzek> u for our computer projects.

 12:25 <mbruzek> You can find my wiki page at:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/

 12:25 <mbruzek> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mbruzek

 12:28 <jared> mbruzek: good to see you out and about sharing stuff, is most of your participation in the LUG Ubuntu related?

 12:29 <mbruzek> jared No.  I have given presentations on several different topics.  Our LUG is full of people with different Linux distributions.

 12:30 <mbruzek> The latest presentation was Ubuntu related, but the past 2 presentations were about other topics.

 12:30 <jared> mbruzek: fair enough, curious as some LUGs get very protective around particular distributions so like hearing how others go

 12:31 <mbruzek> My last presentation was about Juju.  There is a link to the Prezi that I created for the meeting.

 12:31 <marcoceppi> mbruzek: do you have any plans to join a loco in your area?

 12:32 <mbruzek> marcoceppi, Yes, I have contacted Tony Yassaro the MN LoCo leader.  There are no meetings in my home town, but I do plan to attend one at some point in the future.

 12:34 <iulian> Thanks for your answers mbruzek.
