 16:07 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:08 <smoser> psivaa, ?

 16:08 <psivaa> smoser: only minor issue is that during minimal installation test of utopic-amd64 the installed size is showing ~4.5k bloated

 16:08 <psivaa> smoser: could not figure out when exactly this was introduced since we had had the install tests broken for a bit

 16:08 <smoser> how much bigger is that than the trusty install ?

 16:09 <psivaa> smoser: 4.5 k

 16:09 <smoser> if we're talking about a few k here or there, its not necessarily any specific addition or deletion.

 16:09 <smoser> are you sure? as in there was exactly zero buffer in the trusty minimal install to make the target ?

 16:10 <psivaa> not sure if understand the question

 16:10 <smoser> you said utopic is ~4.5k "bloated".

 16:10 <psivaa> smoser: yes when compared to trusty i mean

 16:11 <smoser> oh. ok. well, do you consider that explicitly a bug ?

 16:11 <psivaa> smoser: not really, just wanted to point

 16:12 <smoser> theres automated test output for that ?

 16:12 <smoser> do you have link ?

 16:12 <psivaa> yes, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server-dev/ubuntu-test-cases/server-tests-raring/view/head:/testsuites/minimal-virtual/test_install_size/test.py

 16:12 <smoser> output ?

 16:13 <psivaa> http://ci.ubuntu.com/smokeng/utopic/server/amd64/20140808/9568/minimal-virtual/1504958/

 16:13 <smoser> gracias.

 16:13 <smoser> if anyone has anything else for psivaa, speak up.

 16:13 <smoser> psivaa, thanks for humoring me :)
