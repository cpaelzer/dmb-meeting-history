 22:24 <hggdh> #topic -- spineau for Ubuntu Member

 22:24 <hggdh> spineau: please go ahead and introduce yourself

 22:24 <spineau> ok

 22:24 <spineau> Hello, I'm Sylvain Pineau (Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SylvainPineau, LP: https://launchpad.net/~sylvain-pineau)

 22:24 <spineau> I live in France and I'm working for the Hardware Certification Team at Canonical

 22:24 <spineau> My main focus is QA automation for Ubuntu, I'm one of the core developper of Checkbox, the system testing application that we have on the CD since 2008.

 22:24 <spineau> I led a vUDS session last November to share the Checkbox roadmap for Trusty.

 22:24 <spineau> I'm also an upstream maintainer of several Checkbox dependencies in Debian

 22:25 <spineau> I contribute to kernel SRU testing and made various contributions to other test frameworks used by the community.

 22:26 <hggdh> I see you have some testimonials :-)

 22:26 <spineau> hggdh: indeed, and roadmr accepted to be online with uq

 22:26 <spineau> us

 22:26 * roadmr waves - here to support spineau

 22:27 <hggdh> roadmr: hi, I see you :-)

 22:27 <hggdh> I have no questions for you -- I know your work...

 22:27 <spineau> I didn't mention UEC ;-)

 22:28 <meetingology> Current voters: IdleOne PabloRubianes cjohnston hggdh

 22:29 <spineau> UEC was Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, I wrote some tests for it

 22:29 <hggdh> yeah. UEC was fun regarding tests...

 22:29 <spineau> it was using eucalyptus before we decided to use openstack

 22:30 <cjohnston> spineau: do you do anything with a LoCo team or anything else? All I see on your wiki appears to be related to what you do for your job

 22:30 <spineau> cjohnston: I'm not involved with a French loco team, I'm too far from Paris TBH

 22:31 <spineau> cjohnston: I attended to some Perl Mongers meetings but that's  unrelated to ubuntu

 22:33 <spineau> Usually my main way to contribute is via triaging or via IRC

 22:33 <IdleOne> How do you contribute via IRC specifically?

 22:34 <spineau> IdleOne: answering/asking questions

 22:35 <spineau> IdleOne: we created #checkbox to help people who wants to start using the checkbox toolset

 22:35 <spineau> on freenode
