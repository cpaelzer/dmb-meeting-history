 16:39 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:39 <jdstrand> Thanks to the following people thanks for help on security updates since the last meeting: Johan Van de Wauw (tamrat) provided debdiffs for precise-saucy for mapserver (LP: #1267616), Thomas Ward (TheLordOfTime) provided debdiffs for raring for znc (LP: #1268658), Felix Geyer (debfx) provided debdiffs for Precise, Quantal, Saucy for quassel (LP: #1255362). Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1267616 in mapserver (Ubuntu Saucy) "Possible SQL Injections with postgis TIME filters" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1267616

 16:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1268658 in znc (Ubuntu Trusty) "Null pointer dereference in webadmin module [CVE-2013-2130]" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1268658

 16:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1255362 in quassel (Ubuntu Trusty) "Clients may be able to access buffers belonging to other users" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1255362

 16:40 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Review of any previous action items

 16:40 <jdstrand> [ACTION] chrisccoulson to benchmark oxide and qtwebkit once armhf builds work

 16:40 * meetingology chrisccoulson to benchmark oxide and qtwebkit once armhf builds work

 16:40 <jdstrand> [ACTION] chrisccoulson to send results of benchmarks to list

 16:40 * meetingology chrisccoulson to send results of benchmarks to list

 16:40 <jdstrand> aiui, these are both blocked on usable IM in oxide, which is blocked on qt5.2 which is blocked on the frameworks discussions

 16:41 <jdstrand> however, we just determined that we may be able to use https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers/+archive/qt5-beta2 for this

 16:41 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: that pretty much captures that discussion, right?

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> it does

 16:42 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: would it be too optimistic to hope for working IM usiong that ppa this week?

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> it should be possible, especially now I can build much faster

 16:43 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: ok, I'd like to keep those as actions then. the benchmarking itself should go quickly I would think once IM is there

 16:43 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: if there is a problem with benchmark performance, we may be able to get phonedations to help

 16:43 <jdstrand> I am going to take an action to update people on this

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> cool :)

 16:44 <jdstrand> [ACTION] follow-up on list regarding status of oxide benchmarks and why they are blocked

 16:44 * meetingology follow-up on list regarding status of oxide benchmarks and why they are blocked

 16:45 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:45 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:45 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:46 <jdstrand> I've got some pending openstack updates to work on-- but I'm having to more or less write the patches myself for earlier releases, so it has been slow going

 16:46 <jdstrand> I have quite a bit of sprint preparation to do for next week

 16:47 <jdstrand> if time allows, I'll try to get to some work items, but am guessing that will have to wait for next week

 16:47 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:47 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:47 <mdeslaur> I'll be publishing some USNs, and will be once again going down the list

 16:47 <mdeslaur> I'm off on Wednesday

 16:47 <mdeslaur> and that's about it from me

 16:47 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:49 <jdstrand> tyhicks: why don't you go next and sbeattie can give status later

 16:50 <tyhicks> ok

 16:50 <jdstrand> (also, jj is out for the meeting)

 16:50 <tyhicks> I'm looking into an ecryptfs bug at the moment (LP: #1265841)

 16:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1265841 in linux (Ubuntu) "kernel BUG at /build/buildd/linux-3.11.0/fs/buffer.c:1268!; RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff816e3efd>] [<ffffffff816e3efd>] check_irqs_on.part.11+0x4/0x6" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1265841

 16:51 <tyhicks> I'll be mainly working on that and hacking on kdbus again this week

 16:51 <tyhicks> probably a little prep for the sprint, as welll

 16:51 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:51 <jdstrand> question

 16:51 <tyhicks> ok

 16:52 <jdstrand> sorry I keep asking about this-- what is going on with yama?

 16:52 <jdstrand> (on touch)

 16:52 <tyhicks> jdstrand: I've wasted way too much time trying to test it on the emulator

 16:52 <tyhicks> jdstrand: as of Friday, the emulator segfaults when running unity8 autopilot tests

 16:52 <jdstrand> hrmm, sorry about that

 16:52 <tyhicks> jdstrand: I was hoping to talk jjohansen into letting me use one of his devices next week at the sprint to test it

 16:53 <jdstrand> so, are you able to run it on hardware?

 16:53 <jdstrand> ok, that seems reasonable

 16:53 <tyhicks> all of the dev work is done and has been for a long time

 16:53 <tyhicks> I just don't have a way to run the autopilot tests

 16:53 <jdstrand> yeah

 16:54 * jdstrand nods

 16:54 <tyhicks> I thought getting a cheap maguro would help me test this (along with other touch landings)

 16:54 <jdstrand> I think testing on real hardware and then coordinating with ogasawara for a pull request then landing will hopefully be fine at this point

 16:55 <jdstrand> if the emulator is busted for doing our tests, we can't be expected to use it

 16:55 <tyhicks> but it runs the old kernel version that we're not backporting to :/

 16:55 <tyhicks> I tried running with ubuntu-emulator and with the older emulator set up using xnox's test scripts

 16:56 <tyhicks> ubuntu-emulator segfaults and the test scripts eventually hang because the emulator dies at some point

 16:56 <tyhicks> oh, and that's without the yama backport patches... so they're not at fault

 16:56 <tyhicks> I was just trying to get a baseline

 16:56 <tyhicks> ok, that's it for me

 16:56 * jdstrand nods

 16:57 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:57 <sarnold> I'm on community this week

 16:57 <jdstrand> we'll test on real hardware and try to get you unblocked

 16:57 <tyhicks> thanks :)

 16:58 <sarnold> I've got some libotr patches from debfx to test and release this week, several MIRs, reviewing serge's new cgmanager (nearly done, one file left!), and then sprint preparation (looking into the profile loading more deeply)

 16:58 <sarnold> I suspect it isn't all going to get done before the end of the week

 16:59 <sarnold> I think that's me, are we going back to chrisccoulson or on to jdstrand again? (I missed the start..)

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 17:00 <chrisccoulson> this week i'll be looking at some of the oxide bugs that are blocking having a usable browser on the device

 17:00 <jdstrand> tyhicks: oh, chrisccoulson has a manta that I'm sure he's bringing next week

 17:00 <chrisccoulson> last week i switched oxide to cmake, and made cross-compiling work :)

 17:00 <jdstrand> tyhicks: so maybe quick popping a kernel in there and testing on it would be ok

 17:00 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: I'd really appreciate it if I could (ab)use it for a day

 17:01 <tyhicks> yep

 17:01 <chrisccoulson> the bad news is that next week is firefox release week. perfect timing ;)

 17:01 <tyhicks> ah

 17:01 <chrisccoulson> so i'll probably be trying to get that out of the way at the end of this week

 17:01 <tyhicks> well I can ask jj later

 17:01 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: argh :\

 17:01 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: ugh :(

 17:01 <chrisccoulson> yeah, it's pretty annoying

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> i wish they could have done the release this week :)

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> but, oh well :/

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 17:03 <jdstrand> re cmake: \o/

 17:03 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 17:04 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 17:04 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.
