 15:05 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber jodh bdmurray slangasek cjwatson caribou infinity mvo bhuey sil2100 robru)

 15:05 <slangasek> caribou robru bhuey slangasek cjwatson stgraber infinity mvo sil2100 barry jodh bdmurray doko

 15:05 <slangasek> caribou: hi!  you can start if you're around :)

 15:05 <caribou> so me first

 15:05 <mvo_> you win!

 15:05 <caribou> Been busy investigating a but on libnss-ldap for ppc64el

 15:05 <caribou> s/but/bug

 15:06 <caribou> still am matter of fact : looks like libnss-ldap expect __libc_lock_lock to be provided by the libc

 15:06 <caribou> which isn't

 15:06 <caribou> this is only the case on ppc64el

 15:07 <caribou> rest of the time I have been busy on Maas issues and preparing for the merges of the package I have upload rights for

 15:07 <caribou> (done)

 15:07 <slangasek> ribru: you're next

 15:07 <caribou> but I would eventually appreciate some help on the __lib_lock_lock issue eventually

 15:07 <sil2100> o/

 15:07 <slangasek> ribru: when do you go  back to being robru? :)

 15:07 <sil2100> Did I miss anything?

 15:07 <slangasek> sil2100: caribou's

 15:07 * sil2100 is still in a meeting

 15:07 <ribru> * added mode to citrain to allow for a special staging instance to not step all over production PPAs

 15:07 <ribru> * prepared a branch to delete archaic 'preprod' mode in favor of this new theoretical staging instance

 15:07 <ribru> * enabled vivid landings in citrain code

 15:07 <ribru> * ripped out the option that lets people disable ~rtm version for source builds in RTM (including source syncs but also RTM-first landings)

 15:07 <ribru> * helped barry test new system-image landing support phased updates

 15:07 <ribru> * landings, landings, landings.

 15:07 <ribru> (done)

 15:09 <slangasek> * post-sprint catch-up

 15:09 <slangasek> * vivid opening, mostly work related to the phone channels

 15:09 <slangasek> * discussions around our channel and branch model for the coming cycle

 15:09 <slangasek> * shepherding of partner packages

 15:09 <slangasek> * various HR tasks, still have open job reqs, working on filling

 15:09 <slangasek> (done)

 15:09 <cjwatson> Did a bunch of work on opening the 15.04 archive, setting up image builds, etc.  Wrote branch-livefses script (unfortunately initially buggy: forgot to copy require_virtualized).

 15:09 <cjwatson> Planning for my transition to Launchpad Engineering, tentatively scheduled for the end of this year.

 15:10 <LocutusOfBorg1> Hi, I'm a Debian Maintainer in dm list for some packages, the list of packages I currently maintain is ~20, including virtualbox and something more. I started only one month ago my DD process, and I would like to become a  per-package uploader for packages I maintain, unfortunately I don't see in the wiki any page about DM, but only for DDs, what is the best path to achieve (if possible) such goal? thanks

 15:14 <bdmurray> barry: how was your "flight"?

 15:14 <barry> bdmurray: brutal

 15:14 <slangasek> caribou: __libc_lock_lock> have you ruled out this being a bug that would be fixed by a rebuild of libnss-ldap on ppc64el?

 15:14 <caribou> slangasek: that's what I'm testing atm.

 15:15 <slangasek> ok :)

 15:15 <caribou> slangasek: for some reason manual builds and/or sbuild do get me a libnss-ldap library with __libc_lock_lock in use even on amd64

 15:15 <caribou> slangasek: I'm testing a PPA build atm

 15:15 <bdmurray> no jodh?

 15:15 <caribou> slangasek: i.e. the version in the Utopic archive DOES NOT use __libc_lock_lock for amd64 but if I build it locally it does

 15:18 <slangasek> mvo_: btw, were you in the loop on the breakage when they tried to update apt in ubuntu-rtm/14.09 to pull in the security fixes?  Since we're wanting to roll the phone images forward to 14.10 proper, I'm not sure if there's something else that needs looking into there or if it was only an issue because they were selecting a subset of related packages

 15:18 <mvo_> slangasek: I am not aware of breakage - what happend?

 15:19 <slangasek> mvo_: bug #1385656

 15:21 <slangasek> doko__: here?

 15:21 <cjwatson> slangasek: I gave feedback in that bug on the proper way forward

 15:21 <cjwatson> it's fixed in 14.10 already

 15:21 <slangasek> cjwatson: ok

 15:21 <cjwatson> not that long after the fork I think

 15:22 <mvo_> slangasek: thanks, I need to look at this in more detail

 15:23 <slangasek> mvo_: well, sounds like cjwatson has already answered it when I hadn't noticed, so probably nothing to worry about

 15:23 <slangasek> looks like no doko today
