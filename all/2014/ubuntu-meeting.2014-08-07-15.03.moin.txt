 15:04 <sil2100> We can always shuffle from the whole list and just skip people that are not around

 15:04 <robru> ok who has the whole list? ;-)

 15:04 <sil2100> Not super optimal, but it worked ;)

 15:09 <xnox> right. thanks.

 15:09 <cjwatson> I believe infinity and jodh are both off today

 15:10 <cjwatson> Is bhuey around?

 15:10 <robru> bhuey, around?

 15:10 <sil2100> Most of my knowledge about copy2distro actually comes from this week, never saw it before as this part was a bit archive-admin specific ;)

 15:19 <xnox> oh. Who do i talk to to (a) make lazr.authentication project owned by lazr developers (b) make upstream release ?

 15:19 <xnox> ~leonardr registered it, but ~benji is listed as maintainer.

 15:19 <cjwatson> xnox: I'd suggest making it William's problem :)

 15:19 <xnox> cjwatson: =)))))))))))

 15:20 <cjwatson> We can probably track down people to reassign things to an appropriate current team

 15:20 <xnox> cjwatson: excellent.

 15:20 <cjwatson> inc. pypi

 15:20 <barry> xnox: i think i have perms on the pypi project

 15:20 <xnox> i feel like i want to finish the port up, so i'll ping wgrant/barry about things i don't have access to. =) sounds good.

 15:21 <barry> xnox: yep.  i can admin a ton of lazr.* stuff

 15:21 <robru> #topic Any Other Business

 15:22 <xnox> Thanks everyone, it was a blast =) my last meeting for a while ;-)

 15:22 <slangasek> does xnox get to tell us what he's working on?

 15:22 <robru> xnox, you'll be back!

 15:22 <xnox> robru: we'll see.

 15:22 <sil2100> xnox: :<

 15:23 <xnox> slangasek: which bits you'd want me to talk about? systemd? whoopsie ids? python port? rumors from the office?

 15:23 <slangasek> xnox: the last!

 15:23 <slangasek> or, I don't know

 15:23 <slangasek> the whoopsie ids? :)

 15:23 <xnox> slangasek: well, i emailed you brian and ev about whoopsie ids already =)

 15:24 <xnox> slangasek: so in the office there are approximately 20 or so small boxes with bq written on them. I don't have a big enough bag to carry them all, what should I do?

 15:24 * xnox ponders about the post-room in the building.

 15:25 <slangasek> yes, but you haven't shared with the whole team about whoopsie ids

 15:25 <xnox> ok.

 15:25 <xnox> #topic Whoopsie IDs

 15:26 <xnox> So whoopsie when it generates crashes and submits them to error tracker uses a SHA512 hash of a "unique id" for a given machine.

 15:26 <xnox> Typically, we want to gather sets of errors comming from the same machine, but we don't really care how it's identified (hence the SHA512)

 15:27 <xnox> and we'd want to be able to track crashes from same machine across reinstalls.

 15:27 <xnox> for that we need to create unique ids. There are a few strategies implemented at the moment.

 15:27 <xnox> on i386/amd64 product_uuid is used.

 15:27 <xnox> however id generation is now a library which is used by other projects as well.

 15:28 <xnox> for example post-office service on ubuntu-touch uses those ids.

 15:28 <xnox> (post-office is something like push notifications to the devices I believe)

 15:28 <xnox> so product_uuid is ./sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid

 15:29 <xnox> do check yours to see what it's like =) on some of my hardware it's a generic 1234567890, but generally it's unique enough.

 15:29 <xnox> For virtual machines, one can pass --uuid flag to specify a product_uuid.

 15:29 <slangasek> mine says "44444444444444"

 15:30 <xnox> On armhf, product_uuid does not exist hence other bits of uniqueness are used - MAC address and IMEI (unique symcard modem id on GSM phones)

 15:30 <robru> mine looks mostly unique but it has a couple 'FFFF' clauses in it

 15:30 <xnox> slangasek: hm, we should probably black list it.

 15:30 <cjwatson> slangasek: chosen by fair dice roll

 15:30 <slangasek> :-)

 15:30 <xnox> =)))))))))))

 15:30 <stgraber> root@sateda:~# cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid

 15:30 <stgraber> cat: /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid: No such file or directory

 15:30 <xnox> .....

 15:31 <xnox> in cases where id cannot be determined whoopsie falls back through each one. However, one can also override the ID by supplying environment variable

 15:31 <cjwatson> Basically sensible on the systems I can readily get at

 15:31 <xnox> CRASH_DB_IDENTIFIER

 15:32 <xnox> so all of above is good, however it's quite unstable ids through the lifetime of a single boot and/or other operating modes.

 15:32 <stgraber> (that system ithout product_uuid is nothing fancy, it's a 1U supermicro server I use here as a router, it's got all the other product_* files, just not _uuid)

 15:32 <slangasek> oh, see, it's a whitebox server, that's why

 15:32 <slangasek> it's not unique

 15:32 <xnox> For example: product_uuid is root owned file, thus regular userss for libwhoopsie cannot get the same id as whoopsie itself.

 15:33 <xnox> also, if network interfaces are added or removed, and/or ofono (GSM/modem provider) is started or stopped ----- the unique id changes again.

 15:33 <xnox> and lastly if CRASH_DB_IDENTIFIER was used it's also unexposed to libwhoopsie users.

 15:33 <xnox> I've come up with a three step plan to address above issues in the context of rtm and ubuntu touch platform.

 15:34 <xnox> Firstly for the ubuntu-emulator, i've implemented generating uuid per instance at create time and passing --uuid option to qemu such that product_uuid exists on ubuntu-touch emulator i386

 15:35 <xnox> Secondly for ubuntu-touch armhf, I drop whoopsie.override to export and set CRASH_DB_IDENTIFIER cause armhf doesn't have product_uuid

 15:35 <xnox> next, I propose changes to whoopsie to export a world readable /run/whoopsie-id with the ID it chose to use, with a matching change to libwhoopsie0 to read that "cache" file at top priority

 15:36 <xnox> this way all root and non-root users are aligned on the same machine id through the lifetime of boot, irrespective of ofono starting/stopping and networking interfaces changing on the fly.

 15:36 <slangasek> xnox: "export and set" - where does it get the value?

 15:37 <xnox> and lastly, in addition to checking product_uuid, I propose to also check for /sys/class/android_usb/android0/iSerial which is Android specific serial number present on most recent devices.

 15:37 <slangasek> xnox: oh - why in /run/whoopsie-id, instead of /var/lib so it doesn't have to write it each boot?

 15:38 <xnox> slangasek: so $ ubuntu-emulator create -> uses libuuid to create ~/.local/share/ubuntu-emulator/$NAME/.uuid & .whoopsie-id (sha512 hash of .uuid)

 15:38 <xnox> for i386 --uuid is passed from .uuid by ubuntu-emulator run.

 15:38 <slangasek> yep - but you said armhf doesn't have uuid, so how do you inject it there?

 15:39 <xnox> for armhf "env CRASH_DB_IDENTIFIER=sha512-from-whoopsie-id" is written into /etc/init/whoopsie.override as passing it as a kernel cmdline arg looked very ugly.

 15:39 <slangasek> ah, so it's actually written by ubuntu-emulator into the filesystem

 15:39 <slangasek> gotcha

 15:39 <xnox> (so at create base image instance construction time)

 15:39 <slangasek> nice

 15:40 <slangasek> sounds pretty slick to me

 15:40 <xnox> slangasek: re: /var/lib vs /run/ -> I am undecided. With all of the above fixes I believe ids are stable across reinstalls and hence stable on each boot, hence it can live in /run. I am open to writting ot /var/lib as well.

 15:40 <xnox> which is similar to dbus/machine-id.

 15:41 <slangasek> xnox: /var/lib guarantees its presence before whoopsie has started, or if whoopsie fails to start on a reboot for some reason

 15:41 <xnox> slangasek: true. And e.g. installers could write that file out as well.

 15:41 <slangasek> could still be a race if you needed it on first boot, but, well, you don't have much opportunity to crash things on first boot

 15:41 <xnox> ..

 15:42 <slangasek> xnox: thanks for pulling this together

 15:42 <xnox> for an epilogue, I'd like to mention other machine IDs used on our systems.

 15:42 <slangasek> and I think it's useful to have this explained before you go, as I imagine we'll be using it for some time to come

 15:42 <slangasek> other machine IDs> uhoh :)

 15:42 <bdmurray> xnox: so will you switch the merge proposal to use /var/lib?

 15:42 <xnox> dbus uses /dev/urandom to essentially generate /var/lib/dbus/machine-id. All I know dbus system daemon does not start without it. But not much else about it.

 15:42 <xnox> bdmurray: yeap.

 15:43 <xnox> and there is a newish systemdish proposal for /etc/machine-id, which by default is generated by systemd first-boot system unit, and is /var/lib/dbus/machine-id compatible. In the future I can see it used more universally to identify "install id" (as it's persistant for a lifetime of a single installation)

 15:44 <xnox> and systemd also offers "boot-id" to identify an individual boot. (helpful to sort out logs/events as to wether they belong to current or subsequent boot, when e.g. time jitters as well)

 15:45 <xnox> /etc/machine-id is a bit broken at the moment as our livefs builders spit it out on disk image =) something to fix in the future.

 15:45 <xnox> And that's it.

 15:45 <xnox> More Q&A?!

 15:45 <bdmurray> xnox: why don't you useâ€½

 15:46 <xnox> bdmurray: Ð° Ð·Ð°Ñ‡ÐµÐ¼? =)

 15:47 <xnox> oh, there is whoopsie preferences dbus interface through which one can query their id.

 15:47 <xnox> it's useful to browse your own crashes on errors.u.c when authenticated.

 15:48 <slangasek> would be good to have that on the commandline

 15:48 <xnox> dbus-send --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=com.ubuntu.WhoopsiePreferences /com/ubuntu/WhoopsiePreferences com.ubuntu.WhoopsiePreferences.GetIdentifier

 15:48 <slangasek> fwiw I'm hearing reports from ogra_ + ev that the errors.u.c interface may not actually work

 15:48 <xnox> slangasek: commandline just for you ^

 15:48 <bdmurray> won't that be the identifier in /var/lib?

 15:48 <slangasek> I don't want a commandline just for me

 15:48 <slangasek> I want a commandline for the rest of us

 15:48 <slangasek> ;)

 15:48 <slangasek> bdmurray: yes

 15:48 <xnox> bdmurray: once above is merged, it indeed will be =)

 15:48 <xnox> all of my branches are not merged yet. I'll be sheparding for them to be merged.

 15:49 * slangasek nods

 15:49 <ogra_> the ID seems to be changed regulary on the device or some such

 15:49 <slangasek> which I believe means that you'll be nagging me after you've left the company and while I'm on vacation, if I'm not mistaken

 15:49 <ogra_> (someone pointed me to a bug, got to dig it up)

 15:49 <slangasek> ogra_: that part is known and is the bit we're already fixing

 15:49 <ogra_> ah, k

 15:49 <bdmurray> slangasek: hmm? it might not work because the system identifier has changed on the device

 15:49 <ogra_> well then it should just work, no ?

 15:49 <slangasek> ogra_: I thought you were asserting that crashes from a *current* run were not findable on errors.ubuntu.com.  If it's just the other thing, then yeah, it's well in hand

 15:49 <xnox> ogra_: well, i have 3 merge proposals to address whoopsie id stability as explained above =)

 15:50 <slangasek> awesomesauce

 15:50 <slangasek> ok, so, I need to run here

 15:50 <ogra_> slangasek, well, i didnt kill any apps, so i only referred to the crashes that i saw with .uploaded suffix

 15:50 <ogra_> for these i wasnt able to find anything

 15:50 <slangasek> ogra_: yes, so it's an open question whether they happened during the current boot or not

 15:50 <ogra_> right

 15:50 <slangasek> anyway - thanks for the meeting all

 15:51 <bdmurray> ogra_: did you check /var/log/upstart/whoopsie.log for the OOPS ID?

 15:51 <slangasek> keep up the great work

 15:51 <bdmurray> ogra_: then look up the corresponding oops?

 15:51 <slangasek> robru: don't forget to #endmeeting on your way out :)

 15:51 <robru> is it over? ;-)

 15:51 <xnox> dunno, do we have AOB people?

 15:52 <xnox> (.... before we jump)

 15:52 <ogra_> bdmurray, nope, i only checked the return value from the debus call

 15:52 <ogra_> *dbus

 15:52 <xnox> http://goo.gl/ncjXiY

 15:53 <xnox> ogra_: check that ofono is running; check id from the dbus call; stop ofono, check id again.

 15:53 <bdmurray> ogra_: so the unique identifier for the crash, the OOPS ID, gets storted in the whoopsie log file. from that oops page there will be a link to the problem bucekt

 15:53 <xnox> ogra_: i believe at the moment they will be different, but with my proposed patches it will stay the same.

 15:56 <ogra_> will chefck both (once i have the time ... meetings ... )

 15:57 <robru> #endmeeting
