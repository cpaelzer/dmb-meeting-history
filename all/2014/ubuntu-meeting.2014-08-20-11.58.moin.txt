 11:58 <jared> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 11:58 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Aug 20 11:58:53 2014 UTC.  The chair is jared. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 11:59 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for August 20, 2014.

 11:59 <jared> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 11:59 <jared> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 11:59 <jared> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 11:59 <jared> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 11:59 <jared> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 11:59 <jared> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:22 <RoozbehShafiee> yes

 12:22 <jared> RoozbehShafiee: what that means is we feel it's possible you might meet the criteria but we can't see it clearly enough now to be sure. If you're willing to wait around after the meeting we can go through some information on how to prepare the application a little better

 12:25 <jared> #subtopic Tribaal

 12:25 <Tribaal> Hi everyone!

 12:25 <jared> Hello Tribaal, can you please introduce yourself to the board

 12:25 <RoozbehShafiee> jared: we have Iran ubuntu loco team meeting. but after that we can talk about it :)

 12:25 <Tribaal> So my name is Chris "Tribaal" Glass, I'm an Ubuntu user since breezy.

 12:26 <Tribaal> I'm French, but I was born and raised in Switzerland - and recently moved to Tanzania

 12:26 <Tribaal> I'm a software engineer, passionate about "cloud" technologies and distributed systems

 12:27 <Tribaal> I currently work for Canonical in the Landscape team, and do quite some openstack work (although not direct contributions yet)

 12:28 <popey> "While I am a Canonical employee this is my own initiative, and is neither required nor sanctionned by my employer. I feel that I belong as a member of the community in my own right"  ← I like this

 12:29 <Tribaal> I did a few contributions along the years, especially as part of LoCos and forums in the beginning, then to code and packages more recently

 12:29 <Tribaal> popey: thanks, I would be the second Ubuntu member in my team (of 13), it's not a requirement at all

 12:29 <Tribaal> I just felt it was a natural step to take for me at this point

 12:30 <Tribaal> I will also apply for upload rights in the future, but that is a separate process :)

 12:30 <cyphermox> great :)

 12:30 <Tribaal> One particular highlight of my "contributions"

 12:30 <jared> Tribaal: thanks for the well prepared application, one question. I clicked through to find out about the Tanzanian LoCo but couldn't find much. Is there a wiki page or website?

 12:30 <Tribaal> that is dear to me

 12:31 <Tribaal> jared: oh, not at the moment unfortunately - I took over really recently (last week), because I discovered a basically dead LoCo on arrival in Tanzania

 12:31 <jared> Tribaal: ah fair enough. Just curiosity really.

 12:31 <Tribaal> jared: I really hope to revive the LoCo, the number of Users in Tanzania is quite high

 12:32 <belkinsa> +1

 12:32 <popey> How long have you worked at Canonical? Did you work on Ubuntu before that?

 12:32 <Tribaal> popey: I work for Canonical since... Jan 2012

 12:33 <Tribaal> popey: most of my contributions to Ubuntu before that were "soft" (LoCos, forums, install parties)

 12:33 <rickspencer3> I wouldn't underestimate the value of those contributions

 12:33 <popey> Yeah, that's some of the most valuable. Especially in your own time.

 12:33 <Tribaal> popey: but many of my contributions since then were not motivated by my work

 12:33 <Destine> +1

 12:33 <Tribaal> indeed

 12:34 <Tribaal> I'm not minizing the importance of community at all :)

 12:35 <popey> I have no more questions.

 12:35 <jared> So anymore questions from the other board members or shall we vote?

 12:35 * belkinsa is ready to vote

 12:35 <jared> #vote Tribaal for Ubuntu Membership

 12:35 <meetingology> Please vote on: Tribaal for Ubuntu Membership

 12:35 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1/-1/+0 #channelname)

 12:39 <belkinsa> Not a problem.

 12:39 <jared> Alright, we'lll move on to the last applicant

 12:40 <jared> #subtopic filipsohajek

 12:40 <filipsohajek> Hi, I give it up, i don't have enough contributions, and i'm not prepared for it. Thanks

 12:40 <belkinsa> ...

 12:40 <Tribaal> oh

 12:40 <belkinsa> I will speak to him if possible.

 12:41 <jared> Hm, well if anyone knows filipsohojek please let them know we're here to help if they have any questions

 12:41 <belkinsa> And that too.

 12:41 <rickspencer3> :(

 12:41 <rickspencer3> would have been nice to have provided some encouragement

 12:42 <Tribaal> yeah... but he quit so fast :(

 12:43 <jared> Ok, well that being said I'll end the meeting unless anyone else has any other business?

 12:44 <jared> RoozbehShafiee: we end the meeting for the logs but we're happy to discuss still, just so you don't think we're going to ignore you

 12:44 <silverlion> o/

 12:45 <jared> silverlion: how can we help

 12:46 <silverlion> jared : I am sorry, I was told to be here in this meeting of the ubuntu community

 12:46 * silverlion feels bad to be late

 12:46 <silverlion> but traffic is to blame

 12:46 <cyphermox> silverlion: are you here to cheer for someone?

 12:47 <silverlion> cyphermox : no belkinsa told me to be here today ... just got approved by the mailing list

 12:47 <silverlion> never mind I'll catch with her later

 12:47 <silverlion> disregard my disturbance.

 12:47 <belkinsa> silverlion, you are already a member and you don't need to do anything else.

 12:47 <popey> ☻

 12:47 <popey> Welcome anyway ☻

 12:47 <belkinsa> anything else more for it*

 12:47 <cyphermox> if you got approved, the best we can do is probably just congratulate you and apologize we couldn't do it "in person" last time :)

 12:48 <jared> silverlion: no disturbance at all, well timed to be honest

 12:48 <silverlion> jared beg your pardon?

 12:49 <jared> silverlion: I was just saying you weren't disturbing, it was a well timed entrance as we'd just finished the applications for this meeting

 12:50 <silverlion> jared a ok, now i understood

 12:51 <jared> Cool

 12:52 <jared> Well it appears there isn't any other business?

 12:52 <belkinsa> I think we need to help RoozbehShafiee still.

 12:53 <jared> #endmeeting
