 16:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1248283 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "juju userdata should not restart networking" [High,Triaged]

 16:15 <arosales> I think rbasak marked the dbus as invalid

 16:15 <arosales> and juju-core has the bug targetted for 1.18 which should be in trusty in the next couple of weeks

 16:15 <jamespage> indeed - speaking of which we need the FFe for juju-core

 16:15 <jamespage> I'll do that

 16:16 <arosales> jamespage thanks I think fwreade was also compiling a list of bugs and features that will be landing

 16:16 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/horizon/+bug/1259166

 16:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1259166 in horizon (Ubuntu Trusty) "Fix lintian error" [High,Triaged]

 16:16 <arosales> zul ^

 16:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1273877 in neutron (Ubuntu Trusty) "neutron-plugin-nicira should be renamed to neutron-plugin-vmware" [High,Triaged]

 16:17 <zul> arosales:  yep

 16:17 <gaughen> o/

 16:17 <arosales> jamespage are you the neutron resident expert still?

 16:18 <jamespage> yeah - we need to get that in for the next o/s milestone

 16:18 <jamespage> if someone wants to learn how todo a rename its a good example

 16:18 <arosales> takers?

 16:18 <arosales> also this one looks like a good opp

 16:18 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dovecot/+bug/1278897

 16:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1278897 in dovecot (Ubuntu Trusty) "dovecot warns about moved ssl certs on upgrade" [High,Triaged]

 16:19 <jamespage> that's the policy one

 16:19 <jamespage> I don't think debconf is being used appropriately

 16:20 <arosales> any folks interested in those two bugs?

 16:20 <arosales> gaughen, could you follow up on those two for appropriate owners?

 16:21 <jamespage> coreycb is going to pickup the rename

 16:22 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:22 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:22 <arosales> jamespage, smoser any BPs you want to hit here?

 16:22 <arosales> I think smoser said he was going to update his I called out last week

 16:23 <smoser> i dont have any specifically.

 16:23 <smoser> in general, people need to just be aware that thursday is feature freeze

 16:23 <jamespage> I'll flag up the openstack charms one

 16:23 <jamespage> charm work is always loaded to back cycle but there are alot of work items on that BP still

 16:23 <jamespage> (and only one reviewer/lander right now)

 16:23 <smoser> if you have features not in, you need to file FFE for those. or postpone.

 16:24 <arosales> curtain, openstack charms, ceph, mysql alt, cloud-init, openstack (general) are all in the "red"

 16:24 <arosales> be a good week to get BPs updated to reflect reality

 16:25 <jamespage> mysql is OK - we have alot in the NEW queue awaiting AA review

 16:25 <arosales> jamespage ack

 16:25 <arosales> and I am sure ceph is ok

 16:25 <jamespage> the only thing that might not make it is percona-server - I've just reviewed Perconas first version of packaging - but it needs a bit of work still

 16:25 <arosales> smoser is following up on curtin and cloud-init

 16:25 <jamespage> arosales, yeah - I  have a few WI's on that BP that will probably drop off post firefly release

 16:26 <arosales> and you already called out openstack*

 16:26 <jamespage> like all the mod_fastcgi stuff

 16:26 <arosales> #action gaughen ensure BPs are updated

 16:26 * meetingology gaughen ensure BPs are updated

 16:26 <arosales> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:27 <arosales> caribou doesn't look to be here

 16:27 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:28 <psivaa> hello from my side:

 16:28 <psivaa> the same failures with smoke tests that i posted last week and they only need test code adjustments:

 16:28 <psivaa> 1. tomcat (control port not starting to listen due to lack of entropy)

 16:28 <psivaa> 2. test_mod_php on lamp server tests

 16:28 <psivaa> 3. minimal virtual installs on amd64 bloarting by about 5 MB

 16:28 <arosales> psivaa, Hello

 16:28 <psivaa> arosales: hello ^

 16:28 <psivaa> i can't do much of the testcode since server developers own it :)

 16:28 <arosales> psivaa, did you try rbask suggestion re entropy from last week?

 16:29 <arosales> and I think jamespage said you could bump the server size by 5mb

 16:29 <psivaa> arosales: i haven't but as i said i can't push to the ubuntu-test-cases/server branch

 16:30 <arosales> and I thought rbask acked the lamp tests?

 16:30 <smoser> psivaa, do you have a merge proposal ?

 16:30 <smoser> one of us can certainly merge it if you have one.

 16:31 <psivaa> smoser: ok, i could do the MP's for the tomcat and the size issue and there is already an MP for the php failure

 16:31 <psivaa> https://code.launchpad.net/~psivaa/ubuntu-test-cases/mod_php-fix/+merge/204273 needs merging

 16:32 <smoser> ok. thanks.

 16:32 <psivaa> thank you and that's all from me

 16:32 <arosales> psivaa, ok so hopefully we can get those resolved this week

 16:33 <psivaa> arosales: ok

 16:33 <arosales> psivaa, ping in ubuntu-sever if you need an ack

 16:33 <arosales> psivaa, thanks

 16:33 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:33 <smb> Nothing from my side this week. If there are not questions. Or do you have something sforshee?
