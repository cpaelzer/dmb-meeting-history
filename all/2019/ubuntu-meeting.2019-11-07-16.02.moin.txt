 16:12 <bdmurray> Apparently julian thinks we should work on this

 16:13 <infinity> Should we pass it by the security team for an audit to see if it's a security issue?

 16:13 <infinity> Crashing on invalid input always smells possibly exploitable.

 16:13 <juliank> +1

 16:14 <bdmurray> Okay, can somebody ping the guarder of the van in their channel?

 16:14 <infinity> Cando.

 16:14 <bdmurray> and I'll card it

 16:14 <bdmurray> bug 1848856

 16:15 <xnox> +1 on what infinity said

 16:15 <xnox> infinity:  should we private security it?

 16:15 <infinity> No.

 16:15 <bdmurray> it'd still be archived

 16:15 <xnox> ah, didims

 16:15 <infinity> It's not private if the fix is upstream.

 16:16 <infinity> xnox: "diddums"

 16:16 <vorlon> duodenums

 16:16 <infinity> duodiddum

 16:16 <infinity> s

 16:16 <bdmurray> It looks like didrocks is talking to the people in bug 1848856 so lets leave it with him

 16:16 <ubottu> bug 1848856 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "Upgrade from 19.04 to 19.10 with zfs on root fails with grub syntax error" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1848856

 16:16 <xnox> does it not start with a silent 'k'?

 16:17 <bdmurray> nothing new in rls-ee

 16:17 <bdmurray> although what is the status of bug 1848211?

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1848211 in valgrind (Ubuntu Focal) "valgrind fails to use debug symbols from glib/gtk" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1848211

 16:18 <bdmurray> it seems stalled upstream too

 16:18 <bdmurray> Is there anyway we could get that moving?

 16:18 <tdaitx> did anyone notice that the income bug tasks html has a bug? It spells "Łukasz Zemczak" as "ukasz Zemczak"

 16:19 <bdmurray> tdaitx: sssh

 16:19 <sil2100> oh no, my fancy L

 16:19 <tdaitx> should I have said feature?

 16:19 <bdmurray> it's been broken forever

 16:20 <infinity> sil2100: Don't you mean your fancy W?

 16:20 <sil2100> infinity: I guess it's a bit of both, looking like a fancy L but sounding like a fancy W

 16:21 <bdmurray> I don't think see any other bugs worth discussing

 16:21 <xnox> rbalint:  is the valgrind issue the same as WSL one?!

 16:22 <bdmurray> ‽

 16:22 <xnox> rbalint:  the one from yesterday? about the linker

 16:22 <xnox> and the offset pointing beyond end of file blah balh

 16:22 <infinity> xnox: ⸘‽

 16:22 <rbalint> xnox, it seems similar, may be with the same root cause!

 16:23 <bdmurray> What wsl issue is this?

 16:23 <rbalint> bdmurray, https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4461

 16:23 * xnox the new systemd group chat name is «pɯǝʇsʎs»

 16:24 <rbalint> +1 for picking the valgrind card, too

 16:25 <bdmurray> rbalint: What do you mean "picking"?

 16:26 <xnox> bdmurray:  i think he means trying valgrind against rebuilds as suggested to try with WSL issue.

 16:26 <rbalint> bdmurray, i think it is in incoming

 16:26 <rbalint> i meant handling it as rls-ff-tracked

 16:26 <bdmurray> okay, I'll card it and move it into Committed in case people can pick up more

 16:26 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:27 <bdmurray> rbalint: Can you update the valgrind bug with info about the WSL ideas?

 16:28 <bdmurray> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:28 <bdmurray> vorlon: Can you lead this bit?
