 15:13 <xnox> ah

 15:13 <tdaitx> any more questions?

 15:13 <cyphermox> ohh

 15:13 <juliank> their mirrors fail if you have a file of size N and do a partial request for N-; they send you a redirect rather than a 416 with range: byte */N

 15:14 <tdaitx> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-dd-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <xnox> juliank, fun

 15:14 <xnox> tdaitx, hmmm. i guess we should update the url to -ee-  no?

 15:14 <bdmurray> aren't we on ee now?

 15:14 <bdmurray> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ee-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:14 <tdaitx> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ee-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:16 <bdmurray> there's not much new there

 15:16 <bdmurray> or really nothing new

 15:16 <tdaitx> move along?

 15:16 <vorlon> there are 3 high in incoming, what should we do with them?

 15:17 <bdmurray> target the update-notifier one

 15:17 <bdmurray> bug 1821412

 15:17 <ubottu> bug 1821412 in update-notifier (Ubuntu) ""System program problem" report button does nothing" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821412

 15:18 <vorlon> +1

 15:18 <bdmurray> I guess I should test bug 1825021 again

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1825021 in apt (Ubuntu) "apt's dpkgpm.cc WriteApportReport function should gather more data" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1825021

 15:19 <bdmurray> Given what juliank said

 15:19 <juliank> yup

 15:19 <bdmurray> I'll card it

 15:19 <bdmurray> Or there is a card already

 15:19 <bdmurray> Is that card prioritized?

 15:19 <juliank> bdmurray: I mean, it also means that the modify PATH thing in u-r-u is useless with upgrades from cosmic and later

 15:20 <juliank> You'd have to set the apt DPkg::Path option to actually set a path with those

 15:20 <vorlon> I'll prioritize it

 15:20 <bdmurray> juliank: but it happened on upgrade from cosmic2disco so it did work

 15:21 <juliank> odd

 15:21 <juliank> hmm

 15:21 <juliank> no wait, it's only in disco

 15:21 <juliank> so it's upgrades from disco that will start misbehaving

 15:21 <juliank> maybe

 15:21 <juliank> not sure

 15:21 <juliank> Like I don't know what is in that imported dir

 15:22 <bdmurray> juliank: which dir? imported in u-r-u only contains invoke-rc.d

 15:22 <juliank> yeah that dir I think

 15:23 <juliank> Like if you add something in there in eoan, it won't be used by disco

 15:23 <juliank> that is, disco->eoan upgrades

 15:23 <bdmurray> I hear you

 15:24 <bdmurray> so either way that needs testing and I'll update the card

 15:24 <bdmurray> that leaves bug 1812688 as high

 15:24 <ubottu> bug 1812688 in automake-1.16 (Ubuntu) "self-check-report.sh fails on armhf/disco, was set to skip as an ubuntu delta without explanation" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1812688

 15:25 <vorlon> yeah we should probably at least revert that and leave it on the pile

 15:25 <vorlon> so +1 from me for taking it

 15:25 <bdmurray> Okay, will target / card

 15:26 <bdmurray> that's it then

 15:27 <tdaitx> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:27 <tdaitx> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:29 <gaughen> rbalint, xnox which of you are going to pick up those systemd related things

 15:30 <vorlon> the systemd autopkgtests continue to have a distressingly high failure rate

 15:30 <xnox> yeah

 15:30 <juliank> whoa that queue is small

 15:30 <infinity> Don't queue shame me.

 15:30 <xnox> we need a merge of v241 or the v242rcX and like investigate what's wrong.

 15:31 <rbalint> i take it

 15:31 <vorlon> xnox: v241? what does that have to do with systemd test flakiness?

 15:31 <gaughen> thank you rbalint

 15:31 <xnox> vorlon, to gather new different flakiness!

 15:31 <vorlon> uh

 15:32 <vorlon> xnox: so the recent history of retries shows different tests failing, etc

 15:32 <xnox> storage -> needs to be properly de-raced

 15:33 <cyphermox> I'm happy to take pyparted

 15:33 <xnox> boot-smoke -> we fail to reboot 10 times in a row

 15:34 <vorlon> xnox: do you also have busybox+glibc/s390x? (which is only not late now because I had a reupload)

 15:34 <xnox> no, not yet

 15:34 <gaughen> rbalint, I carded it

 15:34 <gaughen> cyphermox, I'll creat a card

 15:34 <vorlon> xnox: but you promiiiised

 15:34 <cyphermox> gaughen: thanks

 15:35 <vorlon> xnox: or do you need infinity to look at it?

 15:35 <infinity> I don't own a mainframe.

 15:36 <vorlon> infinity: but you have a jumprope

 15:36 <infinity> I... Wat?

 15:36 <vorlon> infinity: setjmp

 15:36 <infinity> Oh.

 15:36 <doko> must be freezing without a mainframe in the room

 15:36 <rbalint> lintian is failing in Debian, too, it guess it will be fixed there soonish

 15:37 <vorlon> infinity: (busybox changed its setjmp/longjmp usage, and it works in Debian w/ glibc 2.28, same binary fails w/ glibc 2.29)

 15:37 <infinity> Yeah, the lintian issue is clearly upstream.

 15:37 <infinity> vorlon: Did you try with 2.28 in cosmic?

 15:37 <infinity> vorlon: (to rule out gcc build target differences, etc)

 15:37 <vorlon> infinity: yes

 15:37 <infinity> Kay.

 15:38 <infinity> I blame IBM.

 15:38 <gaughen> seems we're done with proposed-migration stuff

 15:38 <tdaitx> #topic AOB

 15:43 <vorlon> looks like no other business :)
