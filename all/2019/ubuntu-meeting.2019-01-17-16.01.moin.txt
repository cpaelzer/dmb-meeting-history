 16:11 <waveform> rbalint, I've got an updated package in my PPA: https://launchpad.net/~waveform/+archive/ubuntu/pkg

 16:11 <bdmurray> bug 1804673 - will there be a cosmic SRU for that?

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1804673 in gnutls28 (Ubuntu Cosmic) "gnutls causes gnome-music segmentation fault" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1804673

 16:12 <xnox> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestone/ubuntu-18.04.2

 16:12 <waveform> rbalint, however the relevant upstream bug (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=919564) seems ... well, I'm not sure what they're going to do

 16:12 <ubottu> Debian bug 919564 in src:ruby-albino "ruby-albino: must alter (build) dependency on python-pygments" [Normal,Open]

 16:12 <juliank> bdmurray: I gotta write up a test case for the SRU, but I was busy with the other stuff :)

 16:12 <bdmurray> Maybe we should look at the rls-bb-tracking list?

 16:12 <bdmurray> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:13 <xnox> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1670291

 16:14 <rbalint> waveform, tried updating ruby-albino deps and did fix the test but maybe i missed something

 16:15 <rbalint> waveform, thanks, i'll follow up later

 16:16 <bdmurray> cyphermox: is bug 1401532 in progress?

 16:16 <ubottu> bug 1401532 in grub2-signed (Ubuntu Bionic) "GRUB's Secure Boot implementation loads unsigned kernel without warning" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1401532

 16:20 <cyphermox> yes still in progress, I got the underlying work done in disco late last week

 16:20 <cyphermox> now to do the SRUs

 16:20 <cyphermox> vorlon: should this be targetted for 18.04.2?

 16:20 <cyphermox> (we might not get an answer now)

 16:20 <cyphermox> ok; anything else for point release?

 16:20 <bdmurray> There sure are a lot of bugs with bionic tasks. Maybe I should cull the list and look for important ones.

 16:20 <cyphermox> heh

 16:23 <cyphermox> #topic AOB

 16:23 <bdmurray> Next Monday is a US Holiday but I'll be working.

 16:23 <cyphermox> any AOB?
