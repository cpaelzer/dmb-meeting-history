 20:35 <wxl> there

 20:35 <wxl> that's right

 20:35 <wxl> ok

 20:35 <wxl> Hi Jacob :)

 20:36 <diddledan> we know what we're doing :-)

 20:36 <vlijm> Hi, and thanks fo meeting me

 20:36 <bashfulrobot> Trust us.

 20:36 <vlijm> I do :)

 20:36 <wxl> i mean there are some things i know, at least

 20:36 <Kilos> brave man

 20:36 <wxl> Anyways, please introduce yourself, give us your wiki & Launchpad pages and tell us anything you might feel relevant.

 20:37 <vlijm> her we go: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/vlijm

 20:38 <vlijm> Ubuntu user since 2011 (I believe), currently member of the Ubuntu Budgie core team

 20:38 <vlijm> Ask Ubuntu active user

 20:39 <vlijm> What can I say?

 20:39 <vlijm> wrote quite a lot of stuff for Unity (mostly indicators)

 20:39 <vlijm> Now writing stuff for Ubuntu Budgie etc.

 20:40 <vlijm> Oh, wait you asked for Launchpad, that's ~vlijm

 20:40 * bashfulrobot posts easy link - https://launchpad.net/~vlijm

 20:41 <wxl> Great!

 20:42 <wxl> Anyone here want to give kudos and support of Jacob?

 20:42 <bashfulrobot> Is it appropriate if I left a testimonial?

 20:42 <wxl> Sure, doesn't hurt :)

 20:42 <diddledan> yes, popey did that for me when I joined and he was on the board at that time :-p

 20:42 <bashfulrobot> Well in that case....

 20:43 * popey arrives

 20:44 <Kilos> hi popey

 20:44 <diddledan> damn. when you speak ill of the devil

 20:44 * wxl images popey swooping in like Batman

 20:44 <diddledan> wxl: in his underwear? or was that Superman?

 20:44 <wxl> diddledan: I'm not sure whether or not popey has Batman underwear

 20:45 <diddledan> ... must be professional. :-p

 20:45 <popey> I just dropped by to say "holy cow" at the amount of work Jacob does on askubuntu. It's very impressive.

 20:45 <fossfreedom> \o ... happy to endorse Jacob - as project lead of UB have watched with interest how Jacob has made UB what it is today.  Equally in AU land - active and dynamic and eveyone just loves his well thought out contributions. Credit to Ubuntu

 20:45 <vlijm> :) thanks a lot!

 20:46 <bashfulrobot> Jacob (when he joined UB) came in mostly writing applets in Python. When we have a need to move these over to Vala - it did not even phase him even though one can argue over the merits of each language. We all have our fav tools. He dove right in. Continues to drive new features into the ecosystem that people outside of Ubuntu take advantage of. Does his best to support there as well. It is not uncommon for us to see Majaro users

 20:46 <bashfulrobot> in our forums who use some of the applets he has written. He is very active on a consistent basis in our team channels, Ask Ubuntu, our Discourse forum, etc. He spends the time.

 20:46 <vlijm> Thing is, always difficult to tell about oneself I guess, so please fire away

 20:47 <wxl> Membership Board: any questions for Jacob?

 20:47 <Kilos> nope i am happy

 20:47 <diddledan> I'm good :-)

 20:47 <bashfulrobot> I'm good
