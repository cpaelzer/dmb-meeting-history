 13:05 <cyphermox> #topic Review of previous action items

 13:05 <cyphermox> I suppose we could say a mailing list was agenda

 13:06 <cyphermox> that's being taken care of by Josh.

 13:06 <cyphermox> then there's mailman3 and openstack; but we should probably cover this as bugs in and of themselves

 13:06 <cyphermox> am I missing anything?

 13:07 <didrocks> I don't think you are

 13:07 <cyphermox> ok

 13:07 <cyphermox> #topic New MIRs

 13:07 <cyphermox> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:07 <cyphermox> there are 11 open bugs from that search, I don't know that we need to go through them, but we should see what we can unblock right now

 13:08 <jamespage> from an openstack perspective bug 1815991 can be pushed to next release

 13:08 <ubottu> bug 1815991 in masakari (Ubuntu) "[MIR] masakari and masakari-monitors" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1815991

 13:08 <jamespage> that feature is 'preview' imho

 13:08 <cyphermox> ok; that's good to know

 13:08 <jamespage> I'll comment

 13:09 <cyphermox> btw, that would just mean it will stay in this New list

 13:09 <doko> sorry, having some network issues here ...

 13:10 <cyphermox> doko: np

 13:11 <cpaelzer> I'm here

 13:11 <cpaelzer> sorry to be late

 13:12 <cyphermox> well, there are bugs in the new list; we should assign them, get them off the list... that's basically it

 13:12 <cyphermox> let's move on to the meat of this meeting

 13:12 <cyphermox> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 13:13 <didrocks> (yeah, I'm triaging some right now)

 13:13 <cyphermox> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:13 <cpaelzer> I have processed a few of jamespage last week

 13:13 <cpaelzer> ahve not found time this week yet

 13:13 <cpaelzer> but I could talk to the mailman3 related bugs

 13:13 <cpaelzer> you all have a mail with the subject "Status and next steps of the Mailman3 related MIRs"

 13:14 <cpaelzer> but we can as well talk that here

 13:14 <cpaelzer> The TL;DR is that I look for experience on glwelwyd, norm and python-django-extensions - and for a full review on  twitter-bootstrap and uwsgi

 13:14 <cpaelzer> If one or two of you could take the latter we could discuss the former here if you like

 13:15 <cyphermox> I answered on glwelwyd

 13:15 <cpaelzer> yep that is what I epected on that - thanks for the confirm

 13:15 <cyphermox> I think splitting the font out is the way to go, but it's something that takes time

 13:15 <cpaelzer> yep, and will be post buster but that is fine

 13:15 <cyphermox> the short-term would be to drop dep

 13:16 <cpaelzer> I'll put that task on the server Team

 13:16 <cpaelzer> drop-dep seems not to work well (without UI stuggle)

 13:16 <cyphermox> that means you're blocked with that MIR for this release though

 13:16 <cyphermox> your only short-term is dropping the depends

 13:16 <cpaelzer> nobody had hope for 19.04 anyway

 13:17 <cyphermox> I'll have a look at the two others for mailman3 next

 13:17 <cyphermox> what about openstack?

 13:18 <cyphermox> jamespage already mentioned masakari could wait a bit, but there's more

 13:18 <jamespage> I just noted the heat-dashboard one

 13:19 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: for my tracking and pinging which two do you mean with "the two others" the full reviews on twitter-bootstrap and uwsgi or my questions on norm and python-django-extensions ?

 13:20 <cyphermox> I meant full review of twitter-* and uwsgi

 13:20 <cpaelzer> thanks++

 13:20 <cyphermox> I can answer the other questions, after the meeting

 13:20 <cpaelzer> great

 13:20 <cyphermox> jamespage: you mean https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/heat-dashboard/+bug/1750576?

 13:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1750576 in heat-dashboard (Ubuntu) "[MIR] heat-dashboard" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 13:21 <jamespage> yes

 13:21 <cyphermox> I never got a response there

 13:21 <cyphermox> or you mean you noted for your team to action it?

 13:21 <jamespage> I also see you asked on bug 1543754 but I've not responded

 13:21 <ubottu> bug 1543754 in python-pykmip (Ubuntu) "[MIR] barbican, python-pykmip" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1543754

 13:21 <cyphermox> oh ok

 13:21 <jamespage> cyphermox: leave those both with me - I'll chase coreycb and deal with the pykmip one myself

 13:22 <cyphermox> fwiw, for tests I don't expect them to be *fixed*, just that if they can't be enabled we should have a papertrail of why

 13:22 <cpaelzer> I'd take usbguard off the list and handle that this week

 13:22 <cpaelzer> didrocks: this came from seb - do you know if this is 19.04 urgent or just 19.10 material?

 13:23 <jamespage> cyphermox: ack understand - tbh the unit testing across horizon + dashboards generally needs improvement - its not been revisited since the archive re-org re bd's vs runtime depends

 13:23 <cyphermox> ok

 13:23 <cyphermox> anything else?

 13:24 <didrocks> cpaelzer:I can ask, but I don't think it's 19.04 material or I would have been pinged

 13:24 <cyphermox> #topic Any other business?

 13:24 <cyphermox> same question, different form; any OB?

 13:25 <cpaelzer> ok didrocks, then any time this week will be early enough

 13:25 <didrocks> cpaelzer: doing as we speak :)

 13:25 <didrocks> cpaelzer: "maybe for next cycle"

 13:25 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks

 13:25 <didrocks> thx ;)

 13:27 <cyphermox> #endmeeting
