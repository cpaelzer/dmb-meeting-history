 15:17 <ubottu> bug 1831252 in initramfs-tools (Ubuntu Bionic) "panic=-1 is completely ignored by the initrd causing unexpected behaviour" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1831252

 15:17 <bdmurray> ogra: Are you planning on working on that bug?

 15:18 <ogra> bdmurray, i discussed it with xnox and thought this is foundations land

 15:19 <ogra> we have fixed it downstream for the specific customer that had issues with it though (by simply setting panic=30)

 15:19 <ogra> so i wasnt actually planning to ...

 15:19 <vorlon> I don't understand how the initramfs handling of the panic argument on the kernel commandline in any way impacts the kernel's behavior

 15:20 <ogra> it doesnt

 15:20 <vorlon> I expect that to be handled in kernel

 15:20 <vorlon> I agree it's foundations' responsibility if there's a bug in initramfs-tools

 15:20 <vorlon> I just don't yet understand the stated bug

 15:21 <vorlon> I guess we should take it for investigation

 15:21 <cyphermox> otoh later you'll have a mangled kernel cmdline in userspace; is that an issue? why are we even mucking with panic= in initramfs?

 15:21 <ogra> panic=-1 is a kernel option to force immediate reboot (vs using a positive value for delay)

 15:21 <vorlon> cyphermox: the kernel commandline is not writable by init

 15:21 <cyphermox> vorlon: no, but things in initramfs may want it for some reason

 15:22 <cyphermox> and it would be in some environment, even if it's not modified in /proc/cmdline

 15:22 <ogra> and in the initrd script there is no handling of negative values so it drops you to a shell instead of rebooting

 15:22 <vorlon> right, so if the kernel panics, it itself should see the panic=-1 on the (immutable) commandline

 15:22 <vorlon> and reboot

 15:22 <cyphermox> yup

 15:22 <vorlon> and bugger userspace

 15:22 <ogra> except that its not the kernel that panics but an initrd script that fails

 15:22 <vorlon> you're saying the initramfs script fails because the option is set?

 15:22 <ogra> then the panic() function kicks in ... fails and drops to a shell

 15:23 <ogra> yes

 15:23 <vorlon> ok

 15:23 <ogra> it has no handling for panic=-1

 15:23 <vorlon> so yes, let's dig into that

 15:23 <gaughen> vorlon, thoughts on the importance?

 15:23 <vorlon> gaughen: medium, really

 15:23 <ogra> if you use secureboot you probably dont want the system to drop you into a shell at any time ... in case an admin has set panic=-1

 15:23 <gaughen> should we shove this discussion in the bug?

 15:24 <ogra> s/shell/root shell/

 15:24 <xnox> bah

 15:24 <xnox> bah

 15:24 <xnox> bah

 15:24 <vorlon> black sheep

 15:24 <bdmurray> have you any wool?

 15:25 <gaughen> xnox!

 15:25 <gaughen> welcome

 15:25 <gaughen> missed you

 15:25 <gaughen> xnox, don't worry rbalint gave your status

 15:25 <xnox> status report no ready: openssl, zecureboot, subiquity, systemd, kernel =)

 15:25 <bdmurray> bug 1823434 came out of rls-dd review

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1823434 in pkg-config (Ubuntu) "pkg-config ftbfs in disco" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1823434

 15:25 <gaughen> xnox, we've moved on

 15:26 <vorlon> I've confirmed the build failure

 15:26 <vorlon> in ee

 15:27 <vorlon> I'm surprised it's not also reported in Debian, but it looks like we have a newer version than they do

 15:28 <gaughen> I think we should handle this one. Will card it

 15:29 <vorlon> I think we should (auto-)commit to all ftbfs fixes of our packages in main

 15:30 <gaughen> I'm okay with us quickly going through these, just quick.

 15:30 <gaughen> next one bdmurray!

 15:31 <bdmurray> bug 1798369

 15:31 <ubottu> bug 1798369 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Reinstall Ubuntu (with preserving existing data) shows error message due to "Could not get lock /target/var/cache/apt/archives/lock"" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1798369

 15:31 <bdmurray> I tested this the other day and while I didn't get the same error message I did still get an error

 15:32 <vorlon> did this one come up in a different context last meeting?

 15:32 <vorlon> the bug is familiar

 15:32 <bdmurray> Yes, does that option still exist was the question so I tested it

 15:32 <cyphermox> we did bring up other ubiqutiy bugs last meeting

 15:32 <vorlon> ok

 15:34 <xnox> vorlon:  panic is also used by initramfs, and drops to shell with '-1' setting instead of actually panicing kernel, for it to read panic= and do the instant reboot.

 15:34 <xnox> vorlon:  the panic() function of initramfs.

 15:34 <gaughen> xnox, you're living in the past!

 15:34 <gaughen> we've moved on

 15:34 <vorlon> xnox: so there's only impact if something else in the initramfs is broken

 15:34 <xnox> vorlon:  yes.

 15:35 <vorlon> hence, medium

 15:38 <bdmurray> That's it for high bugs

 15:39 <vorlon> I notice this is in the list https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1825001

 15:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1825001 in apt (Ubuntu) "Allow archives to send a 4xx response to tell apt to try again later" [Wishlist,Triaged]

 15:39 <vorlon> triaged as wishlist

 15:39 <vorlon> but it's a request from Canonical IS

 15:39 <gaughen> bdmurray and cyphermox are going to meet offline and burn through the whole ee list

 15:40 <vorlon> because they want to mitigate the impact of apt client requests when the pipe is over capacity

 15:41 <juliank> oh, god I was scrolled up in the buffer

 15:42 <juliank> So the main issue I think is that systemd does not give us an option to do retries on timers

 15:42 <xnox> vorlon:  do they want to return that to _all_ clients or _some_ clients?

 15:42 <vorlon> juliank: added a comment to clarify: I think what we actually care about is a user agent in the apt requests

 15:42 <vorlon> xnox: ^^ that

 15:42 <juliank> vorlon: There's a different bug for interactive user agent

 15:42 <vorlon> ah

 15:42 <vorlon> then maybe this bug should be wontfix

 15:42 <juliank> vorlon: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1825000

 15:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1825000 in apt (Ubuntu) "Add ability for mirrors to distinguish interactive and non-interactive apt runs" [Wishlist,Triaged]

 15:42 <vorlon> or fix released

 15:43 <vorlon> ok then I think the latter (with the lower bug number) is the actually interesting one

 15:43 <juliank> vorlon: I want to have real retrying if something failed temporarily, but it's blocked on systemd

 15:43 <juliank> Or writing a daemon or something

 15:43 <vorlon> juliank: ok, well I think /that/ is truly wishlist

 15:44 <juliank> Yes, that's what I discussed w/ someone on IRC, and hence the reason why I marked it as wishlist

 15:44 <vorlon> whereas injecting a different user agent for u-u so that the archive can selectively shed requests when under load is more important

 15:44 <juliank> But that's not entirely clear

 15:44 <juliank> We should inject a user agent when running from timers I guess

 15:44 <vorlon> juliank: what do you think about bumping priority of LP: #1825000 and putting it in the queue?

 15:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1825000 in apt (Ubuntu) "Add ability for mirrors to distinguish interactive and non-interactive apt runs" [Wishlist,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1825000

 15:44 <vorlon> yeah

 15:45 <gaughen> vorlon, juliank you two done?

 15:45 <juliank> Like, also for apt-get update which runs by apt-daily.timer

 15:45 <gaughen> nope

 15:45 <vorlon> (do the json hooks give us enough now to inject a U-A header?)

 15:45 <juliank> Let's bump it to something useful

 15:45 <juliank> vorlon: No

 15:45 <vorlon> ok

 15:45 <gaughen> juliank, vorlon shall I card this?

 15:45 <vorlon> gaughen: yes please

 15:46 <bdmurray> Oh, there was one more bug a friend brought up.

 15:46 <gaughen> moving on

 15:46 <gaughen> oooh

 15:46 <bdmurray> bug 1831453 ;-)

 15:47 <ubottu> bug 1831453 in subiquity (Ubuntu) "[Hyper-V] Install issue for Ubuntu 19.04" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1831453

 15:47 <gaughen> oh me!

 15:47 <gaughen> I thought that would come up at the end in other topics

 15:47 <gaughen> thank you bdmurray

 15:47 <bdmurray> What can I say except "you're welcome"

 15:48 <gaughen> bdmurray, did you see my eye rolling unicorn gif?

 15:49 <gaughen> I figured you'd see it since it involved a unicorn and I know how you feel about unicorns

 15:49 <gaughen> ALTHOUGH, we still don't know who is responsible for the unicorn

 15:50 * gaughen is singing "let it go"

 15:51 <vorlon> I don't understand, what is the reason for this bug being brought in?

 15:51 <vorlon> who is running subiquity in hyper-v?

 15:51 <vorlon> and why

 15:51 <gaughen> the bug submitter

 15:52 <vorlon> I don't think it's a priority for us to support subiquity under hyper-v

 15:52 <vorlon> we provide cloud images for hyper-v

 15:53 <vorlon> and if the submitter is doing this for installer testing, any bugs found on hyper-v only are not a priority
