 16:06 <juliank> ok we can go faster now

 16:06 <sil2100> waveform: I confirmed that the daily-built images boot so I guess it was something busted in the local live-build run, let's debug it later ;p

 16:09 * juliank almost pastged in #ubuntu-installer

 16:09 <juliank> doko: ok, the on-board wifi is crap, but luckily I had lte :)

 16:10 <bdmurray> infinity doesn't seem to be in here

 16:12 <bdmurray> vorlon: what's next on the agenda? there was some discussion at the last minute about what the agenda should really be

 16:13 <bdmurray> s/minute/meeting/

 16:14 <vorlon> ok, what was the outcome of that discussion?

 16:14 <vorlon> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:14 <bdmurray> well doko wanted to add a whole bunch of stuff

 16:15 <doko> bdmurray: don't you see the rls-bb-incoming bugs?

 16:15 <bdmurray> doko: ?

 16:15 <doko> LINK: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:15 <vorlon> doko: can you email the foundations list with any proposed additions to the agendas so that there's a paper trail?

 16:16 <doko> didn't we agree on that already two weeks ago?

 16:16 <vorlon> agree on what?

 16:16 <vorlon> I wasn't here 2 weeks ago so I don't know what was agreed

 16:16 <doko> to walk over https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:16 <doko> every week

 16:17 <vorlon> ok; the current topic is bugs. bdmurray ?

 16:17 <bdmurray> bug 1772222

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1772222 in rsyslog (Ubuntu Bionic) "dangling symlink in /etc/rsyslog.d breaks rsyslogd" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1772222

 16:17 <xnox> that bug number is ugly

 16:17 <bdmurray> I found that when I was reviewing the rls-bb-incoming bugs

 16:17 <bdmurray> xnox: 4 of a kind!

 16:18 <vorlon> bdmurray: throw it to the backlog?

 16:18 <vorlon> rather, I will

 16:18 <bdmurray> Is that conjure-up's fault though?

 16:19 <bdmurray> vorlon: ack, thanks

 16:19 <vorlon> I think it's rsyslog's fault that it breaks under these conditions

 16:19 <xnox> bdmurray, both.

 16:19 <xnox> bdmurray, conjure-up should have cleaned up its mess; and rsyslog should be more resiliant

 16:19 <vorlon> card created

 16:19 <vorlon> bdmurray: next?

 16:20 <bdmurray> okay, moving on bug 1766102 - adam targetted it to bionic and I wonder if it really should be

 16:20 <ubottu> bug 1766102 in debhelper (Ubuntu Bionic) "dh_installchangelogs fails if version is 0" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1766102

 16:20 <bdmurray> or rather should we tag it notfixing

 16:21 <vorlon> bdmurray: agreed, notfixing

 16:22 <vorlon> if infinity has another reason to think it should be SRUed, he can follow up

 16:22 <bdmurray> juliank: you seemed to have some idea about bug 1801629. Should it be fixed in ubiquity?

 16:22 <ubottu> bug 1801629 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Disco) "xubuntu-core needs to depend on cryptsetup and lvm2 or 'apt autoremove' will make a LUKS+LVM encrypted root partition non-bootable" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1801629

 16:23 <juliank> bdmurray: yes, it should

 16:23 <juliank> bdmurray: it's just a matter of running the command from the comment in the installed system after having done all package changes

 16:23 <cyphermox> so they dropped relevant deps from their seed?

 16:23 <vorlon> no, we changed the behavior of autoremoval

 16:23 <juliank> cyphermox: the problem is that my "manually installed" minimization script runs on the "live" image

 16:24 <cyphermox> ah, right

 16:24 <juliank> it marks the packages as auto that are reachable from a metapackage

 16:24 <vorlon> juliank: are you on track to fix that for 18.04.2, given the bug targeting?

 16:24 <vorlon> (upload deadline: yesterday or so)

 16:24 <juliank> and cryptsetup and friend are recommended for that

 16:25 <juliank> vorlon: I have no idea of ubiquity code, so maybe someone else wants to take that over

 16:25 <juliank> vorlon: ah, but this only affects 18.10, not 18.04

 16:25 <bdmurray> oh, well then that makes things easier

 16:25 <juliank> except for the OEM image which seems to do its own thing

 16:27 <vorlon> oh, ok

 16:27 <vorlon> moving on then?

 16:28 <juliank> guess so

 16:28 <bdmurray> what actions should we take on that? card it for disco, won't fix for cosmic and something else for oem?

 16:28 <juliank> there is a card for it in committed, it might want to go the the backlog

 16:29 <juliank> I pulled it into in progress for analysing

 16:29 <juliank> I might keep it open for cosmic in case we do a respin for apt

 16:31 <vorlon> so it sounds to me like everything that needs doing is done

 16:32 <bdmurray> okay, then bug 1811695 - juliank do you have an opinion on what update-manager / aptdaemon should be doing here?

 16:32 <ubottu> bug 1811695 in update-manager (Ubuntu Disco) "/usr/bin/update-manager:RuntimeError(org.freedesktop.DBus.Python.RuntimeError):_on_clicked:_deferable:_convert_dbus_exception:_convert_dbus_exception:cancel:__call__:call_blocking:wait_for_lock:acquire:acquire:_inline_callbacks:get_uid_from_dbus_name:return_value:_inline_callbacks:_cancel:_inline_callbacks" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1811695

 16:33 <juliank> that's a long title

 16:33 <juliank> am

 16:33 <juliank> um

 16:33 <juliank> wait and retry

 16:34 <juliank> kind of similar to what mvo had in mind for apt: https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/merge_requests/6

 16:34 <juliank> "apt: retry acquire the cache if it is already locked for 120s"

 16:34 <juliank> in any case, that should not be a new bug

 16:35 <gaughen> vorlon, cyphermox has a wiki page, I think, for running this meeting - could we move to using that consistently?  then if we all agree to add a topic, we can just update that

 16:35 <bdmurray> juliank: you mean not new for disco?

 16:35 <juliank> yeah, that sounds like a generic thing

 16:35 <vorlon> gaughen: ok, no one has told me where this wiki page is :)

 16:35 <bdmurray> juliank: okay, I'll look for previous ones

 16:35 <bdmurray> vorlon: that's because he's making it right now

 16:36 <cyphermox> not wiki

 16:36 <cyphermox> http://people.ubuntu.com/~cyphermox/meetings/foundations.html

 16:36 <bdmurray> since gaughen called him out ;-)

 16:36 <gaughen> close enough.. I almost said a wiki-like-thng

 16:36 <gaughen> thing

 16:36 <juliank> bdmurray: could also pop up a diaalog saying "Busy, try again later" or something I guess

 16:36 <vorlon> not editable

 16:36 <vorlon> cyphermox: can you move it to the wiki? :)

 16:36 <cyphermox> nope.

 16:36 <vorlon> ok

 16:36 <vorlon> my browser can't read people.u.c

 16:36 <cyphermox> because there's javascript in there, to shuffle

 16:36 <vorlon> I guess we'll never know what it says

 16:36 <vorlon> heh

 16:36 <cyphermox> :)

 16:37 <cyphermox> your browser can't p.u.c?

 16:37 <bdmurray> juliank: oky, thanks

 16:37 <vorlon> cyphermox: yes, it's difficult that way

 16:37 <cyphermox> "what a p.o.s" ;)

 16:37 <vorlon> it protects me from viewing sites that people won't let me edit

 16:37 <cyphermox> hahaha

 16:38 <xnox> win

 16:38 <vorlon> bdmurray: any more on bugs?

 16:38 <cyphermox> point is, it could sure be elsewhere than specifically there

 16:38 <bdmurray> If I can't fix it, I don't want to see it.

 16:38 <cyphermox> I'm sure we could have a ~foundations or something so everyone could modify.

 16:38 <bdmurray> vorlon: nope, not today

 16:38 <vorlon> ok

 16:39 <bdmurray> everyone could modify but vorlon couldn't see?

 16:39 <juliank> I can't even ssh into those servers as me I think

 16:39 <vorlon> [TOPIC] Team proposed-migration report

 16:40 <vorlon> [LINK] http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:40 <vorlon> doko: is this your topic to drive?

 16:41 <juliank> (it should be...)

 16:41 <doko> I can, ...

 16:41 <xnox> systemd is in a better shape now, but still not migratable yet

 16:41 <juliank> doko is our excuses wizard, right?

 16:41 <doko> things to look at: spice

 16:41 <xnox> and juliank was doing gnupg stuff, no?

 16:41 <doko> enigmail

 16:41 <doko> heat-dashboard

 16:41 <juliank> xnox: yeah, I replaced the autopkgtest

 16:41 <vorlon> I'm confused by spice, because lz4 didn't previously list it as a blocker

 16:41 <doko> lintian ftbfs

 16:42 <doko> buls

 16:42 <vorlon> ah spice has a new version in -proposed that passed for the first time

 16:42 <doko> vuls even

 16:42 <doko> xnox: gnupg2 is fixed?

 16:42 <vorlon> so we can badtest && rerun the test with all-proposed (doing)

 16:42 <juliank> vorlon: that is annoying

 16:42 <vorlon> that leaves systemd as the lz4 blocker

 16:42 <juliank> doko: yes, gnupg2 is fixed

 16:42 <juliank> need to retrigger

 16:42 <xnox> hmmmm heat-dashboard & horizon is like jamespage and/or his friends?

 16:43 <xnox> maybe coreycb

 16:43 <vorlon> xnox: if we rerun systemd autopkgtests for lz4 with all-proposed are they going to pass now?

 16:43 <xnox> vorlon, yes v239 is broken for lz4, v240 is fixed for lz4

 16:43 <xnox> vorlon, but there are other systemd regressions in v240

 16:43 <xnox> vorlon, it is safe to release lz4 without systemd

 16:43 <doko> juliank: can you do that?

 16:43 <juliank> yes

 16:43 <vorlon> xnox: ok, will override

 16:43 <xnox> vorlon, the systemd test suite was "lets test a bug in lz4, yeah, still there" but now 'lz4 is fixed and not buggy'

 16:43 <coreycb> xnox: yes heat-dashboard & horizon are ours

 16:44 <xnox> coreycb, please fix them =) or pester people. they look hot on http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:44 <xnox> coreycb, well ubuntu-openstack portion of the report

 16:44 <vorlon> xnox: this will of course make systemd autopkgtests fail consistently in devel, but that's more or less status quo

 16:44 <xnox> vorlon, yes!

 16:44 <coreycb> xnox: will do

 16:44 <vorlon> ok, hinted

 16:45 <doko> juliank: gnupg2 triggers some failing tests itself

 16:45 <sil2100> I could try looking at heat-dashboard I guess?

 16:45 <sil2100> Ah, coreycb is on it

 16:46 <sil2100> Goooood

 16:46 <sil2100> ;)

 16:46 <juliank> doko: meh, there are no changes in gnupg outside debian/tests

 16:47 <xnox> vorlon, ah, looks there is upstream progress https://github.com/kapouer/marked-man/issues/19

 16:47 <juliank> xnox: The user named '~xnox' has no PPA named 'ubuntu/nonvirt'

 16:47 <vorlon> xnox: huzzah

 16:47 <juliank> xnox: failing software-properties test case

 16:47 <xnox> juliank, that one is dangerous!

 16:47 <xnox> no no that's different!

 16:48 <juliank> xnox: https://objectstorage.prodstack4-5.canonical.com/v1/AUTH_77e2ada1e7a84929a74ba3b87153c0ac/autopkgtest-disco/disco/armhf/s/software-properties/20190130_180736_23562@/log.gz

 16:48 <juliank> xnox: but only one failure, that's odd

 16:49 <vorlon> xnox: are you taking an action to follow up w/ coreycb and jamespage on heat-dashboard, horizon?

 16:49 <vorlon> oh, coreycb already replied, sorry ;)

 16:49 <juliank> xnox: it's working on the test after

 16:50 <xnox> add-apt-repository ppa:xnox/nonvirt --yes --no-update

 16:50 <vorlon> doko: you seem to have skipped over pillow in your list; perhaps you know the status but I don't

 16:50 <xnox> i'll work on software-properties adt

 16:51 <doko> vorlon: mir pending security review

 16:51 <vorlon> ok

 16:51 <xnox> $ lxc launch ubuntu-daily:disco

 16:51 <xnox> cannot read mount namespace identifier of pid 1: Permission denied

 16:52 <vorlon> doko: and do you know anything about lintian's ftbfs? "file-references-package-build-path" unexpected output, seems like a toolchain behavior difference vs Debian

 16:52 <doko> no, didn't look yet

 16:52 <vorlon> ok

 16:53 <vorlon> sounds like we've identified next steps on a reasonable chunk of these, and the queue is definitely coming don

 16:53 <vorlon> down

 16:53 <vorlon> so I'm happy with that

 16:53 <vorlon> doko: anything further to discuss?

 16:54 * xnox is afk

 16:55 <coreycb> xnox: fyi  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django-debreach/+bug/1805690  will unblock horizon. it has a security team ack now.

 16:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1805690 in python-django-debreach (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-django-debreach" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:55 <doko> no, the other stuff is still grayed out ...

 16:55 <vorlon> ok

 16:55 <juliank> vorlon, doko is that https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=920536?

 16:55 <vorlon> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:55 <ubottu> Debian bug 920536 in src:lintian "lintian: fails to build because of test failure" [Serious,Open]

 16:55 <juliank> Fix FTBFS by avoiding "self" false-positives when checking for file-references-package-build-path in the Lintian test suite. (Closes: #920536)

 16:55 <vorlon> juliank: yes; so how about if I just remove the package from -proposed and wait for Debian to fix it (thanks)

 16:56 <vorlon> anything else?

 16:56 <cyphermox> yep

 16:56 <cyphermox> I'll put the meeting stuff on the wiki under FoundationsTeam/

 16:56 <cyphermox> vorlon: that way we can edit

 16:56 <bdmurray> There's a FoundationsTam wiki?

 16:56 <cyphermox> there is

 16:56 <cyphermox> it's old

 16:56 <bdmurray> older than us?

 16:56 <cyphermox> yeah

 16:57 <sil2100> Older than the world

 16:57 <cyphermox> I mean. *SO* old

 16:57 * xnox back

 16:57 <vorlon> cyphermox: ta

 16:57 <xnox> coreycb, tah

 16:57 <vorlon> cyphermox: share the exact link once it exists?

 16:57 <cyphermox> I guess take the opportunity to update the wiki page Members section if you want, too

 16:57 <vorlon> (or declare it now, before it exists :)

 16:57 <cyphermox> vorlon: yup

 16:58 <cyphermox> MeetingScript

 16:58 <cyphermox> whatever.
