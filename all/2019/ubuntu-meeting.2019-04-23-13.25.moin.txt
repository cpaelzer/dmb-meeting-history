 13:25 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 13:26 <cpaelzer> actions from last time were

 13:26 <cpaelzer> a) cyphermox to look for uwsgi (he did)

 13:26 <cpaelzer> b) all to focus on the 19.04 release (which we all did I guess)

 13:27 <cpaelzer> c) discussions on twitter-bootstrap (for mailman3) to siwtch to a newer version (handled on the bug and upstream)

 13:27 <cpaelzer> no old actions left that I'd know of

 13:27 <cpaelzer> anyone else old actions to discuss?

 13:28 <cpaelzer> I consider that as "no"

 13:28 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 13:28 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:28 <cpaelzer> which comes down to only https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/masakari-monitors/+bug/1815991

 13:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1815991 in masakari-monitors (Ubuntu) "[MIR] masakari and masakari-monitors" [Undecided,New]

 13:28 <cpaelzer> this was deferred to 19.10 already

 13:29 <cpaelzer> still it needs to be assigned

 13:29 <cpaelzer> any volunteers?

 13:29 <cpaelzer> jamespage: you said you want more "field testing" of this

 13:30 <cpaelzer> jamespage: do yu want this reviewed as is - or at a later version later in the 19.10 cycle?

 13:30 <cpaelzer> coreycb: ^^ ?

 13:30 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yes - I expect the first POC deployments in the next month or so

 13:30 <jamespage> cpaelzer: we can defer review until after that for 19.10

 13:30 <cpaelzer> jamespage: ok, I'll mark incomplete and assign it to you

 13:30 <cpaelzer> jamespage: then it is off our list until you set it back

 13:30 <cpaelzer> ok?

 13:30 <jamespage> so yes there will be a new version for 19.10 but right now it will broadly be == 19.04 codebase

 13:30 <jamespage> cpaelzer: fine with me

 13:31 <coreycb> cpaelzer: works for me as well

 13:31 <cpaelzer> bug updated
