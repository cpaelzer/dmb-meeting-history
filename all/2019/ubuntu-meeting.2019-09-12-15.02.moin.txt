 15:05 <sil2100> tdaitx: your turn, around?

 15:05 <vorlon> oh also I guess ghc transition finished in the last week :)

 15:06 <sil2100> Guess Tiago is gone?

 15:06 <sil2100> Anyway, I'll go now

 15:07 <sil2100> - SRU reviews and releases

 15:07 <sil2100> - Kernel reviews

 15:07 <sil2100> - FFe reviews

 15:07 <sil2100> - Identified and fixed eoan update-manager regression caused by recent ubuntu-release-upgrader

 15:07 <sil2100> - Discussed and prepared a spec for the ubuntu-image work needed for UC20 support

 15:07 <sil2100> - Booking stuff for the release sprint

 15:07 <sil2100> (done)

 15:07 <waveform> * delved into migration of boot configuration on older platforms and edge cases

 15:07 <waveform> * discovered various issues with ancient firmware (that shipped with bionic)

 15:07 <waveform> * deduced a new config that works on both old and new firmwares

 15:07 <waveform> * diagnosed an issue in livecd-rootfs: pi images no longer point the cloud-init seed to the boot partition (in the last hour - patch to be filed)

 15:07 <waveform> * diddled the u-boot patches around until they made a vague sort of sense for submission

 15:07 <waveform> * delighted in the production of a pi4 kernel by Hui Wang, and hence...

 15:08 <waveform> * ditched my own efforts on the pi4 kernel, but then...

 15:08 <waveform> * debated the possibilities of multiple kernels on an image with sil2100 and vorlon given that the new pi4 kernel efforts appear to be pi4 only (currently incompatible with older variants)

 15:08 <waveform> done ... with apologies to bdmurray

 15:08 <sil2100> hah!

 15:08 <sil2100> Too bad Brian's not around to fully appreciate this

 15:08 <sil2100> bdmurray is off today still I guess

 15:08 <waveform> that's why I figured someone should take his shtick ;)

 15:09 <sil2100> No infinity on the channel

 15:09 <sil2100> Ah, he's out this week too

 15:09 <sil2100> xnox is on plumbers I guess? Same for cyphermox?

 15:09 <waveform> yup

 15:09 <sil2100> doko: o/

 15:10 <vorlon> doko is at GNU cauldron so also maybe not available

 15:10 <doko> - started test rebuilds

 15:10 <doko> - filing bug reports for the test rebuild (in progress)

 15:10 <doko> - toolchain updates for linux 5.3

 15:10 <doko> - now in Montreal for the GNU Cauldron

 15:10 <doko> (done)

 15:11 <sil2100> \o/

 15:11 <sil2100> Any questions regarding status?

 15:11 <sil2100> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:11 <sil2100> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-dd-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:11 <rbalint> seems empty

 15:12 <sil2100> I guess nothing here

 15:12 <sil2100> For ee as well, everything prioritized

 15:12 <sil2100> No high+ bugs

 15:12 <sil2100> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:12 <sil2100> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:12 <sil2100> Can't remember, the imagemagick is blocked on an MIR?

 15:13 <sil2100> *imagemagick upload

 15:13 <rbalint> sil2100, yes LP: #1827442

 15:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1827442 in x265 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libheif" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1827442

 15:13 <doko> sil2100: the incoming report will be pretty full tomorrow ... maybe look at https://people.canonical.com/~doko/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20190906-eoan.html for now

 15:14 <sil2100> doko: we can take a look at that after proposed-migration then

 15:14 <sil2100> So next is liberror-perl, and that's assigned to me

 15:14 <sil2100> Didn't have time to look at it yet though

 15:15 <sil2100> netplan.io, I'd assume cyphermox was looking at that, maybe I should look at it as well since I wanted to dive into netplan anyway

 15:15 <sil2100> Anyone looking at it right now or can I card it and assign it to myself?

 15:16 <rbalint> regarding imagemagick how about building it without libheif, getting that migrated, then picking up libheif again for 20.04?

 15:16 <vorlon> rbalint: there's nothing else of interest in the imagemagick in proposed *except* the libheif re-enablement

 15:16 <rbalint> hm, actually vorlon volunteered doing htat

 15:17 <vorlon> well, LocutusOfBorg had some further changed, but I pinged him asking about this and he didn't respond

 15:17 <vorlon> also it was a revert of a CVE fix so no

 15:18 <vorlon> anyway, I think leaving it blocked as-is on the MIR is best

 15:18 <rbalint> vorlon, ok, no toolchain update made it more secure?

 15:18 <vorlon> not afaik

 15:18 <doko> awaiting security review

 15:18 <rbalint> vorlon, ack, thanks

 15:19 <sil2100> Next would be openssh, also unsatisfiable depends

 15:20 <sil2100> Anyone looking at that? Anyone have any additional info?

 15:21 <vorlon> sil2100: runit is trash and we should remove all references to it from the package

 15:21 <vorlon> (it's a non-init service monitoring framework that we want nothing of in Ubuntu, we use systemd)

 15:22 <vorlon> so someone want to look at that?

 15:22 <vorlon> or did I just volunteer myself ;)

 15:23 <sil2100> Was wondering about the latest upload since Colin did it, but then I saw it's a sync from Debian

 15:24 <sil2100> vorlon: will you card it and assign it to yourself? ;)

 15:24 <vorlon> no, but I'll work on it

 15:25 <sil2100> ...that's more than good enough!

 15:25 <sil2100> Anyway, I guess that's it then

 15:25 <cjwatson> I'm going to be pretty unhappy if every future openssh change turns into a merge

 15:25 <sil2100> doko: you wanted us to look at the test rebuild results for eoan, right?

 15:25 <cjwatson> If you want to do that then please consider neutering dh-runit rather than modifying openssh

 15:26 <cjwatson> vorlon: ^-

 15:26 <vorlon> cjwatson: ack

 15:27 <cjwatson> (since presumably the same thing applies to anything else that's had dh-runit-based patches accepted in Debian, either now or in the future)

 15:27 <doko> sil2100: yes, because I just finished filing the ftbfs / rls-ee-incoming issues

 15:29 <vorlon> cjwatson: (we could also make dh_runit invocation conditional on dpkg-vendor?)

 15:29 <cjwatson> Could, but cumbersome

 15:29 <sil2100> There's 44 packages that need attention from what I see, should we set some time next week maybe to fix some of them?

 15:29 <sil2100> (from the eoan test rebuild)

 15:29 <sil2100> gaughen: what do you think? ^

 15:29 <cjwatson> And I don't see why it would be correct to do it that way if the reason is that it's a distribution-wide policy to avoid runit

 15:29 <gaughen> sil2100, yes, we should.

 15:30 <cjwatson> But let me know if there's some reason I haven't thought of that makes it necessary

 15:30 <doko> sil2100: fine with me, then they are visible in the incoming bugs as well

 15:30 <sil2100> doko, gaughen: let's maybe work on getting a time-slot next week to work on that and see how it goes then

 15:30 <sil2100> We can do that after the meeting

 15:31 <sil2100> In the meantime, let's proceed

 15:31 <sil2100> #topic AOB

 15:32 <sil2100> Any other business?

 15:32 <sil2100> ...timeout!

 15:33 <sil2100> #topic Next chair

 15:33 <sil2100> I choose... xnox !

 15:33 <sil2100> #endmeeting
