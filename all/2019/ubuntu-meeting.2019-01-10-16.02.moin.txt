 16:03 <rbalint> (done)

 16:04 <bdmurray> no mwhudson or xnox

 16:04 <bdmurray> don't see infinity so juliank is up

 16:05 <juliank> doko: function multiversioning

 16:05 <cyphermox> bionic, cosmic:

 16:05 <cyphermox> - attempting to fix syslinux -- patch for gnu-efi 3.0.8 apparently needs update

 16:05 <cyphermox> but new patch FTBFS... annoying and hard to validate this SRU

 16:05 <cyphermox> xenial:

 16:07 <vorlon> waveform: hi, did anyone warn you about this?  any status you want to share?

 16:08 <sil2100> I think I forgot to mention to waveform to prepare notes beforehand!

 16:08 <tdaitx> besides drinking from the firehose

 16:08 <vorlon> :)

 16:08 <waveform> ahhh, that would've been ... erm ... useful :)

 16:08 <vorlon> no worries

 16:08 <vorlon> doko:

 16:08 <doko> - finished the disco / disco-gcc9 test rebuilds

 16:08 <sil2100> waveform: sorry! Well, I was writing those by hand in real time in the past as well when I first joined the team

 16:08 <cyphermox> \m/

 16:09 <vorlon> tdaitx:

 16:09 <cyphermox> that means I should go update my rpi3 now I guess

 16:09 <tdaitx> A happy new year to you all! And warm welcome to waveform =)

 16:09 <tdaitx> - openjdk 8 and 11 from oracle, openjdk 7 from icedtea update

 16:09 <tdaitx> - patch was made available during the holidays

 16:09 <tdaitx> * openjdk-lts autopkgtest disk space issues

 16:09 <tdaitx> - cosmic have autopkgtest enabled but it is not cleaning up tests

 16:09 <tdaitx> - checking a fix for disco (which also enabled autopkgtests)

 16:09 <sil2100> cyphermox: not yet! ;p

 16:09 <tdaitx> Other:

 16:09 <tdaitx> - classes by EOD today and again in two weeks (22-24th January)

 16:09 <waveform> and built u-boot 2018.07-rc3 (working on 3b and 3b+)

 16:09 <tdaitx> - apartment under renovation pushing me to work on odd hours sometimes, also need to run some errands every now and then, will notify on irc when something big is ahead

 16:09 <tdaitx> (done)

 16:09 <cyphermox> sil2100: ;.;

 16:09 <sil2100> cyphermox: ...soon

 16:12 <sil2100> - Discussion regarding core18 beta->candidate test feedback fetching

 16:12 <sil2100> (done)

 16:12 <bdmurray> Why are we fixing bileto?

 16:12 <cyphermox> huh, speaking of rpi3, is this still only for the rpi3 b+ or something? some newer rev of the hardware?

 16:12 <bdmurray> This includes some stuff I did before the break

 16:12 <sil2100> bdmurray: because people are using it

 16:12 <vorlon> cyphermox: if you wish, and the week after too :)

 16:13 <cyphermox> vorlon: zug zug

 16:13 <bdmurray> sil2100: I thought we wanted to get rid of it

 16:14 <sil2100> bdmurray: there's no decision regarding that yet

 16:14 <waveform> cyphermox, for the 3b and 3b+ (and allegedly 2b but I haven't tested that)

 16:15 <waveform> but none of the single-core models

 16:15 <sil2100> bdmurray: we're doing bare maintenance for now, so only fixing stuff when it breaks, but even then with not super high priority

 16:15 <cyphermox> waveform: thanks; I'll have to check again which rev I have... if it's not the right one I'll repurpose for legacy gaming anyway

 16:15 <cyphermox> waveform: I'll go add you to my meeting script now, too, I guess

 16:15 <doko> tdaitx: is the 11 update already released? can't find a tag

 16:15 <gaughen> sil2100, bdmurray we weren't doing any new work on bileto, but were keeping the lights on.

 16:15 <tdaitx> doko: no, not yet released, comes from partner

 16:15 <gaughen> but we had discussed that if at some point keeping the lights on got really hard, we would need to look at ending it

 16:15 <bdmurray> gaughen: so the lights went off and we turned them back on?

 16:16 <gaughen> bdmurray, we jiggled the switch

 16:16 <vorlon> other questions over status?

 16:17 <gaughen> cyphermox, did you push netplan.io to debian?

 16:17 <bdmurray> no questions here

 16:17 <cyphermox> negative, andrewsh did; he did put me up as uploader though

 16:18 <gaughen> excellent

 16:18 <cyphermox> I had caught up with him at Plumbers

 16:18 <gaughen> vorlon, that's all for me.

 16:18 <cyphermox> this is good.

 16:18 <gaughen> it is good.

 16:18 <vorlon> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:18 <vorlon> bdmurray: I wonder if we should talk valgrind

 16:18 <gaughen> there are none.

 16:18 <bdmurray> vorlon: I was thinking we sould

 16:18 <bdmurray> should

 16:18 <cyphermox> Zarro boogs found.

 16:19 <vorlon> LP: #1808508

 16:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1808508 in valgrind (Ubuntu) "Valgrind doesn't work in disco [Fatal error at startup: a function redirection which is mandatory for this platform-tool combination cannot be set up.]" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1808508

 16:20 <bdmurray> So that's keeping apport stuck in -proposed

 16:20 <vorlon> and it's fundamentally not an apport or valgrind bug, it's a bug in the filesystem as a result of usrmerge

 16:21 <vorlon> so I could probably see my way to a skiptest hint around apport currently, to unblock development

 16:21 <vorlon> but this is important to fix for release

 16:22 <bdmurray> vorlon: you also mentioned this would affect gdb too

 16:22 <vorlon> yes

 16:23 <doko> I hate the gdb debug symbols lookup code ...

 16:26 <vorlon> so one question is, if gdb and valgrind are the only things that need it, should we just extend their debug symbol lookup paths

 16:27 <vorlon> libunwind was suggested, but:

 16:27 <vorlon> $ strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libunwind.so.8|grep usr/lib/debug

 16:27 <vorlon> $

 16:27 <vorlon> so no hits there

 16:27 <vorlon> ah, and gdb actually uses /usr/lib/debug/.build-id

 16:27 <vorlon> so maybe only valgrind needs changing

 16:28 <juliank> vorlon: src/dwarf/Gfind_proc_info-lsb.c:      static const char *debugdir = "/usr/lib/debug";

 16:29 <juliank> but maybe it's disabled

 16:29 <doko> build id is used by debhelper v9 and above

 16:29 <vorlon> so we might as well fix valgrind and then we can have a philosophical discussion later about whether /usr/lib/debug should be usrmerged

 16:29 <juliank> I think I saw google-perftools broken once

 16:29 <vorlon> juliank: libc6-dbg  has .build-id

 16:29 <juliank> that was on my usrmerged debian system, though

 16:29 <vorlon> so I think the common case is handled

 16:29 <vorlon> alright, I think the quick path is to just fix valgrind

 16:30 <vorlon> any volunteers?

 16:30 <cyphermox> one other option might be to have the debug package generate the symlinks as needed?

 16:30 <vorlon> cyphermox: please no :)

 16:30 <cyphermox> oh, wait, no

 16:30 <cyphermox> yeah, no

 16:30 <cyphermox> ;)

 16:30 <cyphermox> I'm happy to fix valgrind

 16:31 <vorlon> cyphermox: assigning, thanks

 16:31 <cyphermox> card?

 16:31 <bdmurray> I can make a card for you buddy

 16:32 <vorlon> :)

 16:32 <bdmurray> tdaitx: Should there be a card for bug 1808383

 16:32 <ubottu> bug 1808383 in ant (Ubuntu Disco) "Java 9+ multi-release jars are not supported in ant tasks" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1808383

 16:34 <tdaitx> bdmurray: sure, I will create one for it

 16:34 <bdmurray> tdaitx: cool

 16:34 <bdmurray> that's it from me regarding bugs then

 16:35 <vorlon> [TOPIC] 18.04.2

 16:35 <vorlon> specifically bugs for 18.04.2, so maybe a subtopic :)

 16:35 <vorlon> do we have anything that we think should be fixed in point release but is not yet targeted?

 16:36 <vorlon> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/ actually shows no bugs targeted to 18.04.2 at all

 16:38 <vorlon> there are some subiquity cards targeted, which is understood

 16:38 <bdmurray> maybe I should get this u-r-u SRU done before the point release

 16:39 <juliank> My goal is to get bug 1787460 fixed

 16:39 <ubottu> bug 1787460 in linux-meta-hwe (Ubuntu) "Unattended upgrades removed linux-image-generic" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1787460

 16:39 <juliank> the apt part of it

 16:40 <juliank> feature bug 1811120 is also interesting, but could also wait

 16:40 <vorlon> juliank: is that in a card?

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1811120 in apt (Ubuntu Cosmic) "Backport auth.conf.d" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1811120

 16:40 <juliank> vorlon: it is

 16:40 <vorlon> juliank: can you put the 18.04.2 tag on the card?

 16:40 <juliank> vorlon: done

 16:40 <vorlon> the card for LP: #1793671 is targeted to 18.04.2 but is marked blocked

 16:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1793671 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Bionic) "Proprietary drivers are installed locally and not on the target system" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1793671

 16:41 <sil2100> I think we need https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/livecd-rootfs/+bug/1805668 on the milestone

 16:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1805668 in u-boot (Ubuntu Cosmic) "Building armhf and arm64 Raspberry Pi 3 images" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:41 <waveform> gets my vote :)

 16:41 <juliank> I'm untargeting "Make images not mark all task packages as manually installed" for 18.04.2

 16:41 <vorlon> sil2100: agreed, milestone set

 16:42 <juliank> because #ubuntu-devel just had some potentially related regressions

 16:43 <vorlon> juliank: doh, ok

 16:43 <juliank> (bug bug 1801629 fwiw)

 16:43 <ubottu> bug 1801629 in xubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "xubuntu-core needs to depend on cryptsetup and lvm2 or 'apt autoremove' will make a LUKS+LVM encrypted root partition non-bootable" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1801629

 16:43 <juliank> Should import as a card

 16:44 <vorlon> was https://bugs.launchpad.net/cryptsetup/+bug/1767527 mentioned already?

 16:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1767527 in cryptsetup (Ubuntu) "[18.04] Installation boot failure. WARNING: invalid line in /etc/crypttab" [Critical,In progress]

 16:44 <vorlon> we have an 18.04.2-targeted card for that

 16:44 <sil2100> vorlon: thanks!

 16:45 <vorlon> cyphermox: ^^ that cryptsetup bug has a card in progress that lies somewhere between you and xnox

 16:46 <vorlon> is it in progress from your POV?

 16:47 <vorlon> my question on the bug in October was never answered; marking it incomplete for now

 16:47 <vorlon> ok so anything else for 18.04.2?

 16:48 <vorlon> targeted bug list is now: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/?field.milestone%3Alist=86800

 16:48 <vorlon> going once...

 16:49 <vorlon> twice...

 16:49 <vorlon> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:49 <doko> wait, before AOB ...

 16:49 <doko> devel-proposed: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:49 <bdmurray> I'll be out tomorrow / swapping for some other holiday

 16:50 <vorlon> right

 16:50 <vorlon> apport already discussed

 16:50 <doko> the only one we addressed is the valgrind one

 16:50 <vorlon> anyone want to sort out autopkgtest/autodep8 regressing itself?

 16:52 <doko> the other high profile one is ros-ros-comm

 16:52 <doko> and systemd of course

 16:52 <vorlon> doko: feel free to follow up out-of-band, but are the linux/binutils autopkgtest regressions ignorable?

 16:53 <vorlon> ros-ros-comm looks like something that just needs a badtest hint rather than a regression we've caused

 16:53 <vorlon> paramiko is also blocked by sahara test failures which might be more real

 16:54 <doko> and foundations needs to file some MIRs: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 16:54 <vorlon> I don't think we should try to go through all of the rest right now, we clearly have a backlog due to the break

 16:55 <doko> that's fine, but then we should reserve some time next week

 16:55 <vorlon> doko: uchardet?

 16:56 <doko> yes, kronosnet, intel-ipset-*

 16:56 <doko> mailutils?

 16:56 <doko> maybe just a suggests

 16:56 <vorlon> how are those foundations? the mouseover says server

 16:56 <vorlon> emacs is desktop

 16:56 <vorlon> ;P

 16:56 <juliank> doko: I'm doing some autopkgtest stuff I could probably have a look at that

 16:56 <doko> ohh, even better =)

 16:57 <vorlon> anyway, someone want to volunteer please to open the MIR for uchardet?

 16:57 <doko> ok, then I'll write uchardet myself

 16:57 <vorlon> ok

 16:57 <vorlon> and then we'll close the meeting

 16:57 <vorlon> #endmeeting
