 15:13 <bdmurray> bug 1837068

 15:13 <ubottu> bug 1837068 in valgrind (Ubuntu) "libssh armhf autopkgtest failure on valgrind unhandled instruction: 0xEBAD 0x1CCA" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1837068

 15:15 <bdmurray> vorlon: should we card this?

 15:16 <vorlon> bdmurray: probably not

 15:16 <bdmurray> sil2100: did you look into bug 1833758?

 15:16 <ubottu> bug 1833758 in lvm2 (Ubuntu) "lvm2: vgcfgbackup in postinst takes several minutes" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1833758

 15:16 <vorlon> bdmurray: it looks like this changed in libssl, not in libssh or in valgrind, so it should probably just be marked as a badtest by the release team

 15:17 <bdmurray> vorlon: okay

 15:17 <sil2100> bdmurray: I'm ashamed to say that I did not, once again I have completely forgot about it

 15:17 <sil2100> I am a terrible mentee...

 15:17 <sil2100> I assigned myself to it now

 15:17 <bdmurray> sil2100: I'm gonna find a new one

 15:18 <gaughen> bdmurray, vorlon if we're not going to take this item, we should add a comment

 15:18 <gaughen> bdmurray, vorlon who's going to add a comment?

 15:19 <gaughen> and are we dropping the tag?

 15:19 <vorlon> yes, the tag should be dropped

 15:20 <gaughen> bdmurray, you going to do that? and add a statement as to why?

 15:20 <vorlon> done

 15:20 <bdmurray> gaughen: No because its already been done. ;-)

 15:20 <gaughen> bdmurray, I saw - slangasek did it!

 15:21 <gaughen> next

 15:21 <bdmurray> that's all the High and Undecided for rls-ee-incoming

 15:21 <cyphermox> ok

 15:21 <cyphermox> #topic Release incoming bugs (bionic)

 15:21 <cyphermox> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1833476 is Undecided

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1833476 in nginx (Ubuntu) "libssl1.1 version 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.2 breaks nginx ssl tests" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1833476

 15:24 <vorlon> should be targeted to bionic, since it's an SRU regression

 15:24 <vorlon> it's still incomplete so I'm not sure we should card it

 15:24 <bdmurray> that seems reasonable

 15:26 <bdmurray> that covers the bugs I guess
