 19:01 <rbasak> #topic Review of previous action items

 19:02 <rbasak> cyphermox to deal with PPU rights for Rosco2 and Eickmeyer

 19:02 <rbasak> sil2100 to send out announcements for Rosco2 and Eickmeyer

 19:02 <rbasak> cyphermox to fix the packageset-report script

 19:02 <rbasak> tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:02 <rbasak> slashd to follow up on the APAC Ubuntu community coverage

 19:02 <rbasak> Follow up on the ubuntustudio packageset upload permissions for Rosco2

 19:02 <cyphermox> my PPU actions are done

 19:02 <rbasak> Thanks!

 19:02 <sil2100> cyphermox: \o/

 19:02 <sil2100> Announcements were sent as well

 19:03 <cyphermox> the packageset-report script is changed, too; though I haven't really had much of a feedback on it

 19:03 <rbasak> I had a glance and it seemed reasonable

 19:03 <sil2100> cyphermox: I didn't see the code changes yet, yes, but the packageset changes you sent were ok

 19:04 <slashd> o/ no update on the APAC, still figure it out stuff with my APAC contact who wants to eventually apply for contrib devel

 19:04 <cyphermox> then let's consider this done?

 19:04 <rbasak> tsimonq2: sends his apologies

 19:04 <rbasak> So the first three are done then.

 19:04 <rbasak> 4 is to carry over

 19:04 <rbasak> #action tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:04 * meetingology tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:05 <rbasak> 5 is to carry over

 19:05 <sil2100> o/

 19:05 <rbasak> #action slashd to follow up on the APAC Ubuntu community coverage

 19:05 * meetingology slashd to follow up on the APAC Ubuntu community coverage

 19:05 <rbasak> Who owned 6?

 19:05 <sil2100> No one, this was more like a whole-team toppic

 19:06 <sil2100> i.e. us voting on Rosco2's packageset upload permissions

 19:06 <rbasak> Oh, I see.

 19:06 <rbasak> Where are we with that?

 19:07 <sil2100> So, I guess that's something we should discuss now

 19:07 <sil2100> Do we want to re-start the vote? Did anyone change their minds after our recent discussions and packageset changes?

 19:08 <rbasak> I have synced with cyphermox and I think we now understand each others position better

 19:10 <sil2100> I guess that in overall, for clarity, I would propose re-starting the vote for granting Rosco2 PPU rights to the ubuntustudio packageset

 19:10 <rbasak> I'm quite happy to give Rosco2 upload access to things that affect Ubuntu Studio but not other flavours, as a step towards what I hope would eventually be MOTU.

 19:10 <sil2100> Since we had far too many votes open last time for that that didn't resolve the issue

 19:10 <cyphermox> can we please use the right nomenclature though?

 19:10 <rbasak> However we have some trouble with how that squares with the packageset

 19:10 <cyphermox> ie. if it's PPU, it's PPU, if it's packageset, it's packageset

 19:10 <sil2100> cyphermox: understood

 19:10 <rbasak> Nevertheless I believe that would satisfy the TB requirement.

 19:10 <cyphermox> mixing an matching makes it really hard to understand

 19:11 <cyphermox> rbasak: AFAIK right now the only overlap is xfce* packages

 19:11 <cyphermox> it can be trivially fixed

 19:12 <sil2100> That's basically what I meant, anyway, do we need Rosco2 around for questions? I assumed we all know what we need to know, just that we need to come to a conclusion

 19:12 <Rosco2> o/

 19:13 <sil2100> Rosco2: thanks for being around o/

 19:14 <rbasak> cyphermox: that would bring us back to approving the packageset including all future changes though, versus approving a specific set or narrow definition.

 19:14 <cyphermox> sorry, I don't understand what you mean by that

 19:14 <sil2100> Well, I guess we'd be voting to grant upload rights to the packageset, whatever contents it has now or in the future

 19:15 <sil2100> Packagesets change, sometimes even quite dynamically, and that's normal

 19:15 <cyphermox> that's undeed what we should do

 19:15 <cyphermox> (I think)

 19:15 <cyphermox> I mean, I can remove the overlap now, I don't think we need to block on whether that's done or not just now

 19:16 <cyphermox> (we just need to decide)

 19:16 <rbasak> Sure

 19:16 <cyphermox> my opinion is: there are other packagesets in the same boat, we shouldn't special case; but I'm not against it

 19:16 <rbasak> But my point was that I felt that approving only the "narrow" set was appropriate right now.

 19:17 <cyphermox> ack

 19:17 <cyphermox> by narrow you mean without xfce?

 19:17 <sil2100> Should we vote? Since I'm sure Rosco2 is dying from all the suspense ;)

 19:17 <Eickmeyer> ^so am I.

 19:17 <cyphermox> sil2100: what is your opinion? xfce in or out?

 19:18 <cyphermox> slashd: ^

 19:18 <rbasak> By narrow I mean "stuff seeded by the flavour but not any other flavor" which right now means without xfce, AIUI, but may not be this in the future, so it's not the same thing.

 19:18 <Rosco2> If it makes a difference - I promise not to touch xfce packages without consulting the xubuntu guys

 19:18 <cyphermox> rbasak: well, we can only deal with what is currently real, can't address what isn't a problem right now

 19:19 <sil2100> cyphermox: I don't have a strong opinion, although seeing how big the ubuntustudio packageset will be big anyway, due to the nature of the project

 19:19 <sil2100> That being said, I would really prefer not to block on that, as cyphermox mentioned

 19:20 <slashd> cyphermox, I'm mixed feeling, can't really say 'yes' or 'no' on with or without xfce

 19:20 <rbasak> cyphermox: the point of a packageset approval is to deal with future changes also.

 19:21 <cyphermox> rbasak: sure, but we can only action the right now

 19:21 <rbasak> cyphermox: since I'm specifically reluctant about the defined future changes, PPU for a larger set would be more appropriate IMHO.

 19:21 <rbasak> Say for example PPU to the current contents of the packageset less xfce

 19:21 <cyphermox> there are two separate decisions: is the ubuntustudio packageset what it should be;  and are we ready to give upload rights for what the packageset should be

 19:21 <rbasak> If that is implemented technically by packageset approval, then that's fine by me.

 19:21 <sil2100> I would really not want that

 19:22 <sil2100> eh, ok, I see we still don't have a solid decision here among the team

 19:22 <rbasak> No :-(

 19:22 <sil2100> My rationale for just voting on the 'packageset' upload rights is: question - should Rosco2, as the maintainer of Ubuntu Studio, have upload rights to the ubuntustudio 'packageset'

 19:22 <cyphermox> I feel it's unfair to special-case ubuntustudio; it should be handled (right now) as all the other packagesets. That is, everything that is on the seeds/image is in the packageset.

 19:23 <cyphermox> sil2100: +1

 19:23 <sil2100> My answer is: yes, just like the maintainers of Xubuntu have access to the xubuntu packageset, mate to mate etc.

 19:23 <rbasak> cyphermox: I'm not special casing ubuntustudioi though

 19:23 <cyphermox> if we think packagesets aren't what they should; it's a separate action / voting / whatever to address that

 19:23 <cyphermox> rbasak: no, if you want to do a special PPU you're not, but I feel that's extra work for very little benefit

 19:23 <sil2100> cyphermox: agreed

 19:24 <rbasak> cyphermox: sure, so pragmatically let's save the work and give him the packageset ACL.

 19:24 <sil2100> Regardless of whether the current ubuntustudio packageset is correct or not in our terms, this doesn't change the fact that Ubuntu Studio should not be treated differently from other flavors

 19:25 <sil2100> If it's not, we need to keep working on fixing it, but it's neither Rosco2's or anyone else's from Ubuntu Studio's fault

 19:25 <sil2100> *If it's not correct

 19:25 <cyphermox> rbasak: that was my point yes

 19:25 <cyphermox> aye

 19:26 <cyphermox> are we ready to vote on rosco2's application then?

 19:26 <rbasak> cyphermox: right, but the motion would be different.

 19:26 <rbasak> I propose that we "give Rosco2 upload rights that are the current set of packages in the ubuntustudio packageset less xfce"

 19:26 <sil2100> I would not want that

 19:27 <cyphermox> neither do I

 19:27 <sil2100> I just want a vote: "give Rosco2 upload rights to the ubuntustudio packageset"

 19:27 <rbasak> I think your proposal is to "give Rosco2 upload rights equivalent to the existing definition of ubuntustudio that may change in the future according to that definition"

 19:27 <cyphermox> rbasak: I think we really are in full understanding now; just absolutely disagreeing ;)

 19:27 <sil2100> rbasak: I want to give him the same upload rights as any other flavor maintainers

 19:27 <rbasak> OK. Well we can vote if you like.

 19:27 <rbasak> Though a couple of members have sent apologies

 19:27 <rbasak> So we might struggle.

 19:27 <cyphermox> yeah, that's really quite unfortunately

 19:27 <sil2100> But they have sent their votes

 19:27 <cyphermox> *unfortunate

 19:28 <sil2100> Ah, they actually did not, crap

 19:29 <cyphermox> jbicha did

 19:29 <sil2100> Anyway, I'd propose starting the vote

 19:30 <slashd> sil2100, so voting to give same upload rights as any other flavor maintainers as you said ?

 19:30 <rbasak> Oh I forgot I'm chair

 19:30 <rbasak> Sorry

 19:30 <sil2100> slashd: yes, basically giving him upload rigths to the ubuntustudio packageset - so to the current packageset and however it will look in the nearest future

 19:31 <rbasak> #vote give Rosco2 upload rights to the ubuntustudio packageset - so to the current packageset and however it will look in the nearest future

 19:31 <meetingology> Please vote on: give Rosco2 upload rights to the ubuntustudio packageset - so to the current packageset and however it will look in the nearest future

 19:32 <rbasak> That's everyone here I think?

 19:32 <sil2100> Let's see if tsimonq2 can vote remotely maybe?

 19:32 <rbasak> The motion cannot then pass right now but it can go to email if absent members can vote offline.

 19:33 <Rosco2> Thanks all

 19:33 <Eickmeyer> What was jbicha's vote?

 19:33 <rbasak> Only one further +1 is required

 19:34 <Rosco2> Crossing fingers and plowing on :-)

 19:34 <teward> sil2100: do you need me to ping tsimonq2, who may actually be busy?  (I sent him an unrelated semi-urgent Lubuntu-infrastructure-related ping to no response a few hours ago, so...)

 19:34 <sil2100> rbasak: I guess let's move on then, tsimonq2 seems to be out of terminal

 19:34 <teward> (I may be able to ping him in another mechanism)

 19:34 <sil2100> teward: no need, we'll just do this offline I guess, through e-mail

 19:34 <teward> mmkay :)

 19:34 <teward> *returns to lurking*

 19:34 <cyphermox> oh; jbicha has not mentioned his stance on that vote

 19:35 <sil2100> Sadly

 19:35 <sil2100> I also thought he did

 19:35 <cyphermox> we'll finish this by email then

 19:35 <rbasak> #action tsimonq2, jbicha and micahg to vote on "give Rosco2 upload rights to the ubuntustudio packageset - so to the current packageset and however it will look in the nearest future"

 19:36 <rbasak> #topic (rbasak proxying) Private request

 19:36 <rbasak> One moment please, in a private channel. I think this can be resolved quickly.

 19:43 <rbasak> Done

 19:43 <rbasak> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 19:44 <rbasak> fossfreedom: o/

 19:44 <rbasak> Please could you introduce your application?

 19:47 <sil2100> hmmm

 19:47 <sil2100> I hope we have fossfreedom here

 19:47 <sil2100> In case not, to his defense: he did already introduce himself many meetings in the past

 19:47 <cyphermox> yup

 19:47 <rbasak> Let's move on, and we can come back later if he shows up. Unless we have some people who want to vote in his absence?

 19:48 <sil2100> rbasak: let's maybe continue, we can get back to this later or postpone to the next meeting

 19:48 <rbasak> acheronuk: are you here?

 19:48 <acheronuk> o/

 19:49 <rbasak> #info Deferred

 19:49 <rbasak> #subtopic Rik Mills (acheronuk)

 19:49 <rbasak> acheronuk: o/

 19:49 <rbasak> Please could you introduce your application?

 19:49 <acheronuk> I'm Rik Mills, the current mainly active Kubuntu developer

 19:50 <acheronuk> My application and reasons for applying can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RikMills/Applications/MOTU#Why_am_I_applying.3F

 19:50 <rbasak> Thanks!

 19:50 <rbasak> Any questions for acheronuk?

 19:50 * slashd reading his application page

 19:54 <slashd> acheronuk, If I see it right, you had ~10 sponsored upload in the past 3-4 month, how given you MOTU today will unblock you considering you don't have a huge amount of sponsored upload lately ?

 19:55 <sil2100> slashd: I suppose this was answered 'partially' in his application, I think

 19:55 * sil2100 reads it up again

 19:55 <cyphermox> yes

 19:55 <cyphermox> specifically where his link is anchored ;)

 19:55 <acheronuk> slashd: it will allow me to do more that I might have hesitated to invest time in or bother people (sponsors with). It would also allow me to assit more in transitions and autotests where direct uploads are not the permission problem

 19:55 <sil2100> I guess he does mention that he wants delays to be shortened, probably regarding NEW pacakge uploads?

 19:56 <acheronuk> slashd: yes, subject obviously to as much scrutiny as AAs gave before

 19:57 <slashd> acheronuk, okay

 19:57 <acheronuk> just I would not have to MOTU hunt. That actually has not been as much a probelm lately, but these things come and go

 19:57 <rbasak> Any more questions for acheronuk?

 19:58 <rbasak> #vote Grant acheronuk MOTU
