 15:15 <sil2100> I suppose this is still ongoing, right?

 15:15 <tsimonq2> Sorry, punt.

 15:15 <tsimonq2> Yeah.

 15:15 <sil2100> Let's carry it over then

 15:15 <sil2100> slashd to follow up on the APAC Ubuntu community coverage (carried over) <- slashd is not with us today so let's carry this over as well

 15:16 <sil2100> tsimonq2, jbicha and micahg to vote on "give Rosco2 upload rights to the ubuntustudio packageset - so to the current packageset and however it will look in the nearest future" <- this is done as votes happened via e-mail

 15:16 <sil2100> slashd to add acheronuk to MOTU <- I suppose this was done? /me checks

 15:17 <acheronuk> sil2100: someone did!

 15:17 <sil2100> Yes, it's done I see o/

 15:17 <sil2100> slashd to announce acheronuk's successful MOTU application <- I think this was done as well, but not sure if Eric did send it to all the required lists

 15:17 <sil2100> So let's carry it over for now

 15:18 <acheronuk> there was an email

 15:18 <acheronuk> might have been cyphermox

 15:18 <sil2100> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 15:18 <sil2100> #subtopic fossfreedom

 15:18 <sil2100> fossfreedom_: hello o/

 15:18 <fossfreedom_> hi!

 15:19 <sil2100> fossfreedom_: I guess we all know you already, but from the formal POV, could you introduce yourself? ;)

 15:19 <sil2100> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fossfreedom/UbuntuBudgiePackageSetApplication

 15:19 <fossfreedom_> My name is David Mohammed, I am the project lead of UB and I am today asking for consideration of packageset permissions for our project

 15:20 <sil2100> fossfreedom_: you currently have PPU rights to the main budgie packages, correct?

 15:20 <fossfreedom_> (btw thanks for refreshing the packageset list)

 15:20 <fossfreedom_> Yes - correct - I've listed those in the application also

 15:21 <sil2100> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/packagesets/disco/personal-fossfreedom

 15:21 <sil2100> cyphermox, tsimonq2, rbasak: any questions?

 15:21 <sil2100> (this is the list of current package upload permissions ^)

 15:22 <rbasak> No questions from me

 15:22 <tsimonq2> None from me either.

 15:23 <sil2100> cyphermox: ?

 15:23 <cyphermox> no

 15:24 <sil2100> Excellent

 15:27 <meetingology> Motion carried

 15:27 <sil2100> fossfreedom_: congratulations o/

 15:27 <tsimonq2> Congrats!

 15:27 <cyphermox> fossfreedom_: congrats

 15:27 <fossfreedom_> many thanks all - on behalf of our project ... much appreciation

 15:28 <sil2100> Does anyone remember what in this case should happen to the PPU permissions we have set up for fossfreedom_ in the past?

 15:28 <sil2100> Should we just leave it?

 15:28 <rbasak> Is the package a strict superset of personal-fossfreedom?

 15:29 <sil2100> rbasak: I see at least one package missing in ubuntu-budgie packageset in comparison to the personal-fossfreedom one

 15:29 <sil2100> But maybe it's not needed anymore (since not seeded?)

 15:29 <sil2100> budgie-welcome

 15:29 <fossfreedom_> which one?

 15:29 <rbasak> I wasn't around when personal-fossfreedom was created. IMHO that wasn't the intention of personal packagesets, so maybe it'd be nice to clean it up.

 15:29 <sil2100> fossfreedom_: ^ is that still a thing?

 15:29 <cyphermox> well, he does have upload rights for these pacakges in debian

 15:29 <sil2100> Same for rhythmbox-plugin-alternative-toolbar

 15:30 <sil2100> Ah, ok

 15:30 <cyphermox> so a distinct list is relevant

 15:30 <fossfreedom_> ah - that's now a snap - but yeah - for installers if they install budgie-welcome deb they are invited to install the deb

 15:30 <rbasak> If cleaning up, then we could switch to direct PPU for those.

 15:30 <fossfreedom_> snap

 15:30 <rbasak> And remove personal-fossfreedom.

 15:30 <rbasak> That shouldn't result in any functional difference to his upload permission

 15:31 <sil2100> Does anyone volunteer for adding fossfreedom_ to the ubuntu-budgie packageset and (as a separate task) clean up the personal-fossfreedom set?

 15:31 <cyphermox> well, it wouldn't, but sicne it's already there, there is no harm really

 15:31 <sil2100> (by clean up I mean, remove it and switch to direct PPU)

 15:31 <rbasak> I'm happy to take it but it won't be today, which isn't good.

 15:31 <sil2100> I don't mind either way I guess

 15:31 <cyphermox> the difference is that with a personal packageset we can actually extend the list ourselves instead of asking the TB

 15:31 <rbasak> (for him)

 15:31 <cyphermox> (given that we can do that by email, etc)

 15:31 <cyphermox> it's consistent with delegation

 15:32 <rbasak> cyphermox: yes, but it wasn't originally intended to use that mechanism instead of PPU for everyone

 15:32 <cyphermox> rbasak: tbh, the "intended" is unclear

 15:32 <rbasak> I guess we could, but AIUI we haven't actually taken a decision to do so

 15:32 <cyphermox> it's certainly easier for us to do things that way

 15:32 <rbasak> cyphermox: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/KnowledgeBase#Personal_packagesets_and_glob_expansions

 15:32 <cyphermox> I think it was mostly left to whomever requested it from the TB

 15:33 <cyphermox> sounds consistent

 15:33 <rbasak> It was only for special cases.

 15:33 <cyphermox> ie. a list of packages you get PPU for via Debian Dev could be considered a list that changes often

 15:34 <rbasak> If we want to do it for all PPUs, then fine, but I'd prefer to see us be consistent in how we use the mechanisms.

 15:34 <cyphermox> I mean, I don't care, but it really does seem easier if it was personal lists

 15:34 <cyphermox> it would 1) make it easier for us to extend the PPUs when people request more, and 2) make it easier to audit since the packagesets are already extracted and listed on a webpage

 15:34 <cyphermox> rbasak: +1 on consistency

 15:35 <cyphermox> I prefer the personal- lists.

 15:35 <rbasak> cyphermox: would you like to drive getting the DMB to agree to switch entirly to using the personal- lists?

 15:35 <cyphermox> sure

 15:35 <cyphermox> I'll put it on the agenda for next meeting

 15:35 <rbasak> Assuming my wording is exactly what you want?

 15:36 <rbasak> Sounds good, thanks.

 15:36 <cyphermox> sounds about right

 15:36 <sil2100> Ok, in that case I'll add fossfreedom_ to the packageset, and the rest we resolve next meeting

 15:36 <rbasak> I think I'm roughly on the fence, FWIW.

 15:36 <cyphermox> ok

 15:36 <rbasak> sil2100: +1

 15:37 <sil2100> #action sil2100 to add fossfreedom_ to the ubuntu-budgie packageset

 15:37 * meetingology sil2100 to add fossfreedom_ to the ubuntu-budgie packageset

 15:37 <cyphermox> I'm slightly on the side of personal-, because it's consistent with delegating to us giving the rights, whereas right now we need to ask the TB to run various commands

 15:37 <rbasak> cyphermox: up to you, but maybe an advance mailing list thread would be helpful on this one.

 15:37 <cyphermox> it could be just "edit-acl add <whatever to create a new list>"

 15:37 <cyphermox> rbasak: yeah

 15:37 <sil2100> #topic AOB

 15:37 <sil2100> Anything else?

 15:38 <rbasak> I'm interested in what Launchpad devs think.

 15:38 <rbasak> (on that topic, not AOB)

 15:38 <sil2100> ;)

 15:39 <tsimonq2> Rik told me that his announcements were already sorted.

 15:39 <tsimonq2> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2019-March/040618.html

 15:40 <tsimonq2> Otherwise, nothing else from me.

 15:40 <sil2100> Excellent

 15:40 <sil2100> Ok, let's end the meeting for today o/

 15:40 <sil2100> #endmeeting
