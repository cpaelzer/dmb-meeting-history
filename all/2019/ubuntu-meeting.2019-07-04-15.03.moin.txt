 15:07 <juliank> sil2100 is away

 15:08 <cyphermox> short week (July 1 is Canada Day)

 15:08 <cyphermox> mostly just grub, and figuring out what's up with the ftbfs on eoan with objcopy.

 15:08 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:09 <juliank> infinity is not in here, so me

 15:09 <juliank> (done)

 15:09 <juliank> waveform:

 15:09 <waveform> * Experimented with boot on the Pi4 (largely unsuccessfully thus far - nothing from u-boot); new firmware also seems to break existing u-boot on earlier pi models too

 15:09 <waveform> * Responded to comments on pi image building document

 15:09 <waveform> * Writing proposal for split bluetooth/non-bluetooth core images

 15:09 <waveform> * Attempted to merge core and classic bootscripts, but the A/B support in core is tricky to integrate with classic; will SRU existing eoan flash-kernel to bionic/disco first and merge afterward

 15:09 <waveform> * Discussed open-iscsi changes (decision: SRU to bionic/disco for non-degraded boot state on pi)

 15:09 <waveform> (done)
