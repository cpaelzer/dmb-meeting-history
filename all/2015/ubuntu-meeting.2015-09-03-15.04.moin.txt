 15:04 <tdaitx> - Fixed FTBFS in opencsg (LP: #1490091); no debian backport, debian does not use opengles2 for qt4-x11

 15:04 <tdaitx> - Investigating JRuby FTBFS due to failing spec tests (LP: #1491526); seems like many are due to build environment setup (eg. non-existing $HOME); local chroot has 2 failures and 2 errors, lp build has 21 failures and 13 errors

 15:04 <tdaitx> - Investigating openscad FTBFS on armhf (LP: #1491553, Debian #797816); there are lots of failures in LP and Debian due to conflicting declaration between GL and ES2 (search for "khronos_ssize_t gl3.h"); any reason not to define "khronos_ssize_t" as "ptrdiff_t" instead of "signed long int"?

 15:08 <tdaitx> well, it did get my attention

 15:08 <caribou> sil2100 doesn't seem here

 15:08 <robru> vacation

 15:08 <caribou> k then my turn

 15:08 <slangasek> tdaitx: package builds shouldn't rely on $HOME being set fwiw; if something wants to write to $HOME during the build, create a scratch directory inside the package build tree and set the env var to point there

 15:08 <caribou> Bugfix:

 15:09 <caribou> - lucid -> precise -> trusty upgrade issue

 15:10 <slangasek> pitti has a conflict this afternoon but sent me his status

 15:10 <slangasek> apport:

 15:10 <tdaitx> slangasek, do you recall any package that does that? I would like to take a look and replicate it

 15:10 <slangasek> - stop requiring apt lists to make origin check work with system-images (#1489410)

 15:10 <slangasek> autopkgtest:

 15:10 <slangasek> - Spent way too much time trying to find a non-hackish solution to detect and clean up leaked background processes which cause eternal hangs (hello deja-dup tests!) (#1488359)

 15:10 <slangasek> - various bug fixes and stabilization from daily test watching

 15:11 <slangasek> - enable britney/cloud testing for precise (mostly for kernel/dkms)

 15:11 <slangasek> - big catch-up on bug triage

 15:11 <slangasek> (done)

 15:11 <infinity> tdaitx: If a testsuite actually relies on $HOME in a way that's a pain to patch out, you can just mkdir foo && HOME=foo ./testsuite

 15:11 <barry> tdaitx: tox used to but doesn't need to any more.  you might find a solution in its older vcs history

 15:11 <infinity> tdaitx: But I generally view that as an upstream bug worth fixing.

 15:11 <slangasek> tdaitx: not offhand no, but what infinity said

 15:12 <slangasek> being sure to also remove foo/ in the clean target then

 15:12 <bdmurray> investigation into gtk+3.0 trusty crash rate increase and bucket not updating

 15:13 <tdaitx> infinity, slangasek, barry thanks, I will check if the jruby folks can update their test

 15:14 <robru> cyphermox: ;-)

 15:15 <slangasek> any questions over status?

 15:15 <infinity> tdaitx: It's widely considered very poor practice in the free software world for a build to ever leave its build tree, so shouldn't be a hard sell upstream.

 15:16 <tdaitx> infinity, indeed, but right now I'm not sure if the mspec tests is something they own or just got from somewhere else

 15:16 <cyphermox> no questions from me

 15:17 <slangasek> tdaitx: either way, worst case is they should be able to do the same HOME= trick upstream :)

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:17 <slangasek> anything else today?

 15:17 <barry> monday is a usa holiday

 15:17 <slangasek> o yes

 15:17 <cyphermox> Monday is a holiday in Canada too

 15:17 <caribou> as surprizing as it may seem, it is *not* a holiday in France

 15:18 <tdaitx> wut? it is a holiday in Brazil as well

 15:18 <infinity> caribou: The French would have to work before it would make sense to observe Labour Day.

 15:18 <doko> http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/ftbfs/

 15:19 <slangasek> infinity: they already celebrated it in May, be impressed that they're not taking it twice

 15:19 <doko> at least in main, there is some stuff belonging to foundations ...

 15:19 <barry> so, summer ends in may in france?

 15:19 <cyphermox> doko: I'll fix up curl today.

 15:19 <slangasek> http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/ftbfs/#core specifically, I believe?

 15:19 <cyphermox> (not ftbfs, but you know what I mean)

 15:19 <doko> curl isn't on this list ;p

 15:19 <slangasek> doko: or is there something other than those that you wanted to draw attention to?

 15:20 <cyphermox> not yet!

 15:20 <cyphermox> :)

 15:20 <infinity> cyphermox: You mean the curl-udeb thing?

 15:20 <cyphermox> yeah

 15:20 <barry> i'll look in to python-*

 15:20 <infinity> cyphermox: I think fixing maas is the right answer.

 15:20 <doko> plus: http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-ppc64el-20150902-wily.html  (note these are not ppc64el only)

 15:20 <cyphermox> infinity: it is

 15:20 <infinity> cyphermox: Given that curl-udeb was empty before it was dropped, so they can't possibly have been using it. :P

 15:20 <cyphermox> oh, it was?

 15:20 <infinity> Yeah.  That's why it was dropped.

 15:20 <infinity> It was clearly broken for several releases.

 15:20 <cyphermox> heh

 15:20 <infinity> With not a single person complaining.

 15:20 <infinity> Which is a fair sign no one was using it.

 15:21 <barry> hahahaha dep-wait on pypy*

 15:21 <doko> barry, look first at the pypy MIR, then these will clear up ;-P

 15:21 <doko> dh-exec

 15:21 <cyphermox> infinity: it's not a very much used feature, it's mostly just enrolling maas devices via the ISO

 15:21 <doko> rpm

 15:21 <cyphermox> I'll ask harder if we can just drop that altogether...

 15:21 <doko> sssd?

 15:21 <infinity> cyphermox: Oh, the "enlist in MaaS" bootloader option on the server CD?

 15:22 <doko> libpod-readme-perl

 15:22 <infinity> cyphermox: If that actually relied on curl-udeb, they haven't tested it in years...

 15:22 <cyphermox> infinity: well, it's maas-enlist-udeb that requires curl-udeb

 15:22 <slangasek> doko: heh, rpm shows up as part of the ubuntu-desktop package set, not core

 15:22 <infinity> doko: sssd is RAOF's.

 15:22 <cyphermox> the only thing I could think of to use that was the enlist in MAAS option from the CD

 15:22 <doko> and a lot of perl stuff here: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:23 <infinity> cyphermox: Your logic is sound, but they supposedly test that feature.  So, could need more investigating.

 15:23 <cyphermox> easy enough to test anyway

 15:23 <infinity> Oh look, another java/maven explosion.

 15:23 <infinity> Why, java, why?

 15:24 <infinity> doko: The majority of those perl modules can probably get hand-waved in with a minimal review and subscriber, but I guess we should file a big bug and go through the motions.

 15:24 <slangasek> tdaitx, robru: http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/ftbfs/#core should be driven to zero for release, can you take a look at these and see which ones you can help with?  (feel free to ask any of the core-devs if you have questions)

 15:25 <robru> slangasek: sure

 15:25 <tdaitx> slangasek, sure

 15:26 <doko> infinity, likely, but maybe check as well if they are maintained by the perl team

 15:26 <cyphermox> infinity: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12263705/ don't think they were testing it, otherwise it magically worked without that for some reason

 15:26 <infinity> doko: Yeah.  Most probably are, they have most of CPAN packaged. :P

 15:26 <cyphermox> (that's from debian-cd)

 15:26 <doko> java is known, and ruby is known too, wanted somebody to look at rails; how we can avoid it

 15:27 <infinity> cyphermox: Well, it may well be that maas-enlist-udeb doesn't actually need curl-udeb.

 15:27 <infinity> I'll pick up the firefox FTBFS, I'm sick of arguing with people about it.

 15:29 * pitti rentre -- qu'est-ce que j'ai perdu ? :-)

 15:30 <slangasek> pitti: un peu de ceci, un peu de c'là

 15:30 <infinity> in 250

 15:30 <slangasek> pitti: we're just about wrapped here, can you join mumble?

 15:30 <infinity> ...

 15:30 <pitti> I'm in

 15:34 <slangasek> I think we're done here then

 15:34 <slangasek> unless there's anything else
