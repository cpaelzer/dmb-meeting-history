 16:33 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:34 <tyhicks> Thanks to Rhonda D'Vine (rhonda) for help on security updates for the community supported wesnoth-1.10 last week. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:34 <tyhicks> (LP: #1445688)

 16:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1445688 in wesnoth-1.10 (Ubuntu Utopic) "private file disclosure issue (CVE-2015-0844)" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1445688

 16:34 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:35 <tyhicks> jdstrand is busy atm so we'll skip him for now

 16:35 <tyhicks> he can jump in if he frees up

 16:35 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: go ahead

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 16:35 <mdeslaur> Im currently sponsoring ffmpeg

 16:35 <mdeslaur> tomorrow I have patch piloting duties

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I just published a few updates, and I have a couple more to test

 16:36 <mdeslaur> and I completely forgot about the openssl precise update that I started, which I'll look into again

 16:36 <mdeslaur> that's about it form me, sbeattie?

 16:36 <essembe> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:36 <mdeslaur> essembe: INTRUDER!

 16:36 <tyhicks> who's this guy

 16:36 <essembe> oh bah

 16:36 <sarnold> he looks shifty

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:37 <sbeattie> I'm finishing up preparing the trusty apparmor SRU, I just have a couple of snags I hit to smooth out.

 16:38 <sbeattie> And then I'll switch to focusing on the gcc-pie work

 16:38 <sbeattie> I need to look at tyhicks patchset to support systemd, so we can land that work when W opens

 16:38 <sbeattie> that's pretty much it for me. tyhicks?

 16:39 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: back to your openssl precise update - is that to enable tlsv1.2 by default for clients?

 16:41 <tyhicks> I'm on CVE triage this week

 16:41 <tyhicks> I have a short week and will be off Thursday and Friday

 16:41 <tyhicks> I need to circle back to a number of things that were ignored during the ramp up to the Vivid release

 16:42 <tyhicks> and I want to finish the kernel patches for AppArmor kernel keyring mediation

 16:42 <tyhicks> it would be nice if I could get those patches out for review before Thursday but I'm not sure

 16:42 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:42 <mdeslaur> tyhicks: yes, that's it

 16:42 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:42 <jjohansen> I have a short week this week, I will be off Friday

 16:43 <jjohansen> I have a couple backported CVE kernel fixes to look at and discuss with the kernel team

 16:44 <jjohansen> I also have a couple more apparmor patches to get out to the kernel team, so we can get the fixes into the next round of kernels

 16:44 <jjohansen> bug #1430546

 16:44 <ubottu> bug 1430546 in linux (Ubuntu) "apparmor kernel BUG kills firefox" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430546

 16:45 <jjohansen> being one of them (sorry I seem to have lost my browser tabs)

 16:46 <tyhicks> no problem

 16:46 <jjohansen> and then its back to the apparmor upstream cleanup. I plan to finish up with the domain transition cleanup/fixes this week (not that I didn't plan on finishing that bit last week :/)

 16:47 <jjohansen> I think that is it from me sarnold you're up

 16:47 <tyhicks> jjohansen: I noticed that a new AA kernel bug came in (LP: #1448912)

 16:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1448912 in AppArmor "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1448912

 16:48 <jjohansen> tyhicks: oh I hadn't noticed that one, yet. I'll poke at that one too, this week

 16:48 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:49 <tyhicks> sarnold: go ahead :)

 16:49 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week; I will be working more on openstack updates, and getting the hang of how the different openstack services work, etc.

 16:50 <mdeslaur> sarnold: FYI, I think the updates in the ppa are now out of date, more CVEs came out in the meantime

 16:50 <sarnold> I think I'll poke at the horizon service this week, and try to reproduce one of the issues on serverstack and try to find out if th e issue affects precise or not, and I'd love love love to get an update out the door, but .. thursdays always come so quickly

 16:51 <sarnold> mdeslaur: yes, I think most of those updates are now stale :(

 16:51 <tyhicks> getting an update out this week would be great since you're in the happy place

 16:51 <tyhicks> it is always a little more difficult on cve triage weeks

 16:51 <sarnold> yes

 16:51 <sarnold> so very much yes :)

 16:51 <tyhicks> sarnold: do you plan on updating the packages with the new fixes?

 16:52 <sarnold> tyhicks: I can give it  ashot, I haven't actually looked into the details of any of the fixed packages in the ppa, excepting the one horizon issue

 16:52 <sarnold> .. nor the details of the subsequently discovered CVEs

 16:52 <tyhicks> sarnold: ok, we'll discuss it more in a little bit

 16:53 <sarnold> I may also do some apparmor patch reviews for distraction along the way

 16:53 <sarnold> that's me, chrisccoulson?

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> This week, I need to get chromium out

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I'll also be working through code reviews (my queue is quite large now)

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> And I'm currently looking at a browser crash on the phone

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, it's business as usual (hopefully)

 16:55 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:55 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:56 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
