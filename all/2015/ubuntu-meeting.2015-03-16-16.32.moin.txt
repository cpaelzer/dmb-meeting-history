 16:32 <tyhicks> Your contributions are very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:32 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:32 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:35 <tyhicks> lets come back to him

 16:35 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: go ahead

 16:36 <jdstrand> oh sorry

 16:36 <jdstrand> I can go now or after mdeslaur

 16:37 <tyhicks> jdstrand: go ahead :)

 16:37 <jdstrand> ok

 16:37 <jdstrand> so, the performance reviews are all done

 16:38 <jdstrand> I've been discussing snappy signatures and hashes with mvo, tyhicks and mdeslaur. we are getting real close to agreement. after which, I'll write it up

 16:38 <jdstrand> I will be working on snappy hw access this week, and snappy frameworks

 16:39 <jdstrand> all this snappy work will lead into more review tools work as well as click-apparmor

 16:39 <jdstrand> I'm also working on an embargoed issue

 16:39 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I just published some USNs

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I plan on working on php5, libav, and an embargoed issue this week

 16:40 <mdeslaur> that's about it for me, sbeattie?

 16:40 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week.

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'm currently refreshing my gcc-5 pie package against newer versions in the toolchain-r ppa

 16:41 <sbeattie> after that, will continue testing there.

 16:41 <sbeattie> I need to do some apparmor patch review

 16:42 <sbeattie> oh I didn't get to the dhclient not getting its profile applied under snappy, will poke more at that this week

 16:42 <sbeattie> that's it for me, tyhicks?

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm on the community role this week

 16:44 <tyhicks> today, I'll be working on testing and fixing any bugs found in the libapparmor aa_features string parsing routines

 16:44 <tyhicks> jjohansen thinks he spotted a bug (he's probably right) and that patch really needs tests

 16:45 <tyhicks> after that, I think we're really close to landing the libapparmor parser cache API in upstream AppArmor

 16:45 <tyhicks> I'll also be working on AppArmor kernel keyring mediation for user data encryption

 16:46 <tyhicks> and, if I have time, I'll finish up the patches to fix bug #1430532 and send them out for review

 16:46 <ubottu> bug 1430532 in AppArmor "libapparmor needs a public function to break a context into a label and mode" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430532

 16:46 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:46 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:47 <jjohansen> I am on apparmor again this week. I need to finish up with my patches for Bug 1431717, Bug 1430546. I need to follow up with the latest Bug fixes pushed to the kernel team and make sure all patches are on all the kernels they should be.

 16:47 <jjohansen> I'm sure there will be some more to do around the libapparmor cache API, and once that lands I can push my series around dfa testing.

 16:47 <jjohansen> And then its back to the upstreaming work.

 16:47 <ubottu> bug 1431717 in AppArmor "audit qualifier does not become effective" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1431717

 16:47 <ubottu> bug 1430546 in linux (Ubuntu) "apparmor kernel BUG kills firefox" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430546

 16:48 <tyhicks> jjohansen: there's an email to the lsm list that you should probably have a look at

 16:48 <tyhicks> jjohansen: it is in the stacked lsm patch set thread

 16:48 <jjohansen> tyhicks: yeah there are several emails to the list I need to reply too

 16:49 <tyhicks> jjohansen: stephen smalley points out a potential layering issue in apparmor

 16:49 <jjohansen> yep

 16:50 <jjohansen> that is it for /me sarnold you're up

 16:50 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week, and it's another short week for me

 16:51 <sarnold> there are outstanding MIR requests and outstanding openstack testing and updates to work on, not sure which ones I'm going to work on this week, but both are large enough that it's unliekly either one will be completed

 16:52 <sarnold> I'll talk with tyhicks afterwards to figure out the priorities

 16:52 <sarnold> chrisccoulson?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> Hi :)

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> This week, I'm still trying to remove Oxide's dependency on GL share groups. I have a prototype, but it doesn't work yet

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I've also got an embargoed issue to fix

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> other than that, I'm hoping for no surprises this week :)

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:54 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: were you able to get to all the pending merge request reviews last week?

 16:55 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: it's been at least 24 hours without a flash update, so perhaps you'll get one of those :)

 16:55 <tyhicks> heh

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> tyhicks, not all. But the most important ones are done

 16:55 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: good! :)

 16:56 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:56 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
