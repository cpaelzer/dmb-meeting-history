 16:32 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:32 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I'm out all week as I'm going to a conference

 16:33 <mdeslaur> today I'm preparing my travel laptop

 16:33 <mdeslaur> that's it from me, sbeattie, you're up

 16:33 <sbeattie> I'm taking cve triage for mdeslaur this week, since he's gone and I'll be at a conference next week, when it would be my turn.

 16:34 <sbeattie> I'm testing my fix to the apparmor 2.10 regression that prevented it from migrating to wily from proposed

 16:34 <sbeattie> I've also got openjdk-6 on my plate this week

 16:35 <sbeattie> That's pretty much my priorities for this week. tyhicks, you're up.

 16:36 <tyhicks> I'm on community this week

 16:36 <tyhicks> I have a couple designs to work on

 16:38 <tyhicks> I have an embargoed issue

 16:39 <tyhicks> I need to drum up someone to verify the fix for bug #1473584

 16:39 <ubottu> bug 1473584 in linux-manta (Ubuntu Vivid) "AUDIT_USER_AVC messages are not printk'ed when auditd is not running" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1473584

 16:39 <tyhicks> I think jjohansen is going to help me there if he has a chance

 16:39 <jjohansen> sure

 16:40 <tyhicks> and I need to finish the fix for a stale dcache issue in eCryptfs reported on Friday

 16:40 <tyhicks> shouldn't be much work left there

 16:40 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:40 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:40 <jjohansen> I need to finish investigating bind mount issue with apparmor lxd in snappy

 16:40 <jjohansen> look into secure exec around the 4.2 rebase of apparmor

 16:40 <jjohansen> send some apparmor patches upstream for 4.3

 16:40 <jjohansen> still need to finish reviewing the dconf userspace patches

 16:40 <jjohansen> continue working on the fix for bug #1448912

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1448912 in AppArmor "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference (aa_label_merge)" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1448912

 16:41 <jjohansen> thats it for me sarnold you're up

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:42 <sarnold> I need to have a conversation with till about testing ippusbxd, when doing the mir I wondered if it was working as advertised, and realized that we can't really test this thing end-to-end like we do with most packages

 16:43 <sarnold> most of the work with the mir is done, it'd just be useful to have an irc chat with till, rather than back-and-forth over bugmail. oh well, it'll work either way..

 16:44 <sarnold> I suspect I'll pick up more MIRs this week, though may do reactive work if needed

 16:44 <tyhicks> sarnold: he should be catchable over irc

 16:44 <sarnold> and might do an apparmor review or two for a change of pace

 16:44 <sarnold> tyhicks: yeah, I suspect summertime has just made it less likely for us to see each other

 16:44 * tyhicks nods

 16:44 <tyhicks> sarnold: would you be able to publish the openstack updates today?

 16:44 <sarnold> tyhicks: sure

 16:45 <tyhicks> sarnold: that'll be a huge help - thanks!

 16:45 <tyhicks> sarnold: we can sync up afterwards

 16:45 <sarnold> it'll feel great have those moving :)

 16:45 <tyhicks> Chris is likely having connectivity issues

 16:45 <tyhicks> yes

 16:45 <tyhicks> I think we're done with stand-up reports

 16:45 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:46 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
