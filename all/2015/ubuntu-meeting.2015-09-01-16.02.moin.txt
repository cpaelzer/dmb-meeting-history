 16:03 <jamespage> rharper collect team thoughts on whether we should have something like numad and other NUMA related placement stuff

 16:03 <jamespage> rharper, hows that coming along?

 16:04 <rharper> jamespage: oi

 16:04 <rharper> hehe

 16:04 <jamespage> carry over?

 16:04 <rharper> same place as last week

 16:04 <smb> jamespage, There is a Debian packaging in process right now

 16:04 <jamespage> #action rharper collect team thoughts on whether we should have something like numad and other NUMA related placement stuff

 16:04 * meetingology rharper collect team thoughts on whether we should have something like numad and other NUMA related placement stuff

 16:04 <jamespage> smb, oh - right

 16:04 <rharper> maybe;  I'll likely have a session on that at our next sprint and have something proposed for 16.04

 16:04 <jamespage> smb, is that uploaded or pending FFe?

 16:04 <jamespage> rharper, sounds like one for the  next sprint

 16:05 <jamespage> rharper send email to TB about bcache-utils into trusty

 16:05 <smb> jamespage, was uploaded to Debian but had some FTBS afaik

 16:05 <jamespage> rharper, that one was for you as well

 16:05 <arges> we're fixing a build bug or rather kamal is

 16:05 <smb> When that is resolved we try some other ffe

 16:05 <jamespage> ack

 16:06 <rharper> jamespage: I've got it ready for review; need to sync with maas team on details w.r.t whether bcache-tools goes into the default image or if it's OK to be just in-archive

 16:06 <rharper> I'll send it out for server team review today

 16:06 <jamespage> ok - sounds like we can remove that from the list

 16:06 <jamespage> next

 16:06 <jamespage> smoser, rharper get other packages into cloud-image necessary for storage features.

 16:06 <jamespage> I'm assuming thats linked to your comment above?

 16:06 <rharper> it's related, though we did want to have wily get all 3

 16:07 <rharper> in the installed image IIRC

 16:07 <rharper> smoser: ^^

 16:07 <rharper> and then discuss whether to update/change previous images

 16:07 <smoser> rharper and i will look at that later today ?

 16:07 <smoser> rharper, ^ the '?' was to you.

 16:07 <rharper> especially trusty w.r.t new features which may regress folks

 16:07 <rharper> smoser: yes

 16:07 <smoser> but lets talk about that.trusty is more complex.

 16:07 <rharper> correct

 16:07 <jamespage> ok - lets move on - sounds like you guys have it in hand

 16:07 <jamespage> #topic Wily Development

 16:08 <jamespage> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WilyWerewolf/ReleaseSchedule

 16:08 <jamespage> UI and Doc freeze coming up in the enxt two weeks

 16:08 <jamespage> Beta Freeze on 24th probably the most pertinent - for this meeting

 16:08 <jamespage> as I think we'll be doing the Final beta right?

 16:09 <jamespage> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <jamespage> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:09 <jamespage> hmm sparese

 16:09 <jamespage> sparse rather

 16:09 <jamespage> looks like a few problems

 16:10 <jamespage> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1478149

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1478149 in python-tornado (Ubuntu Wily) "python-tornado tests fail against python3.5" [High,Triaged]

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1474667 in ceilometer (Ubuntu Vivid) "log dir permissions are incorrect" [Undecided,In progress]

 16:10 <jamespage> needs a priority

 16:10 <jamespage> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1481337

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1481337 in keepalived (Ubuntu Vivid) "keepalived makes a floating IP available on more than one host after configuration reload" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:10 <jamespage> smoser, rbasak - I think I saw you guys discussion that one right?

 16:10 <jamespage> oh and http://launchpad.net/bugs/1398999

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1398999 in nova (Ubuntu Wily) "Block migrate with attached volumes copies volumes to themselves" [Undecided,Triaged]

 16:10 <smoser> well, i put some comments tehre. yeah.

 16:12 <jamespage> hmm - looks like some movement in libvirt 1.2.17 and above with regards to block migration

 16:13 <hallyn> smb, zul: ^ seen that?

 16:13 <jamespage> but we don't have that in wily yet - can we see if we can pull something in - that sounds useful

 16:13 <jamespage> ?

 16:13 <smb> hallyn, nope

 16:14 <jamespage> thats a really important bug to resolve with regards to instance migration on compute nodes for openstack

 16:14 <rharper> jamespage: is it sufficient to pull in just that or all of 2.17  ?

 16:14 <jamespage> rharper, I'd defer to those more knowlegable but I suspect a pick is just fine

 16:14 <rharper> arges zul and hallyn can confirm the PITA that is libvirt

 16:15 <rharper> jamespage: ok

 16:15 <jamespage> rharper, can you confirm an owner?

 16:15 <rharper> jgrimm: ^^

 16:15 <rharper> jamespage: punting to mangler to assign

 16:15 <jamespage> I've raised a libvirt task as well

 16:16 <jamespage> ack

 16:16 <arges> libvirt 1.2.18 can be synced btw

 16:16 <jgrimm> rharper, ack

 16:16 <hallyn> zul: were you going to merge 1.2.18 this week?

 16:16 <jamespage> #action jgrimm to look for owner for libvirt cherrypick or sync

 16:16 * meetingology jgrimm to look for owner for libvirt cherrypick or sync

 16:16 <arges> also libvirt-python is behind too

 16:16 <jamespage> sounds like things need a catchup

 16:17 <jamespage> jgrimm, ok if I leave that with you to chase?

 16:17 <jamespage> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)
