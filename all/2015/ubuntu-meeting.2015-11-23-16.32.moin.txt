 16:33 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:33 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm testing some icedtea-web updates, and I have an embargoed update to test

 16:35 <mdeslaur> after that, I'll be going down the list, as usual

 16:35 <mdeslaur> that's it

 16:35 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm currently digging in to a couple of build failures I hit after building the vast majority of main with gcc-pie

 16:36 <sbeattie> I also have openjdk-7 packages to test

 16:36 <sbeattie> and that will probably consume my short week this week (US thanksgiving)

 16:37 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:37 <tyhicks> I need to restart the mapplauncherd review (preempted last week by another code review)

 16:37 <tyhicks> I want to start working on AppArmor policy loads inside of a user namespace

 16:38 <tyhicks> and I need to do some snappy sprint prep

 16:38 <tyhicks> short week for me (US holiday + I'm off Wed)

 16:38 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:38 <jjohansen> its a short week for me too due to the thanksgiving holiday, I need to finish up with bug 1446906, and send out a couple more patches for the apparmor kernel SRU for review, and the get back to working on stacking

 16:38 <ubottu> bug 1446906 in lxc (Ubuntu) "lxc container with postfix, permission denied on mailq" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1446906

 16:39 <jjohansen> thats it for /me sarnold you're up

 16:40 <sarnold> I'm on community this week; short week, thanksgiving; I'm finishing the libmicrohttp* MIR, starting DPDK, and reviewing some of the apparmor kernel patches that I assume are headed my way

 16:40 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> I've got a chromium update to sponsor this week, I'm also still waiting for a thunderbird release

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> I shall be preparing an Oxide release for next week as well

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> In addition to that, I've got quite a lot of reviews to get through. I've just done one

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> I'm currently trying to get the camera working in the browser - it's just crashing atm, but I hope to have that done this week

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> Then I plan to work on what we discussed at the sprint for bug 1447345

 16:42 <ubottu> bug 1447345 in Oxide "Support the unprivileged namespace sandbox" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1447345

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> I think that's it

 16:42 <tyhicks> busy week :)

 16:42 <chrisccoulson> (no short week for me)

 16:43 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
