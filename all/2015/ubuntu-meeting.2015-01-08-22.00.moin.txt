 22:00 <belkinsa> Have I forgotten anyone?

 22:00 <belkinsa> Who is all for the meeting?

 22:01 <hggdh> this we are all there

 22:01 <belkinsa> Okay, PaulW2U is ready too.

 22:01 <belkinsa> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!  The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards.  We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as foll

 22:01 <belkinsa> ows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO). Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions. During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applica

 22:01 <belkinsa> nt. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:02 <belkinsa> #topic PaulW2U's Application

 22:02 <belkinsa> Are you ready PaulW2U?

 22:02 <PaulW2U> Yup

 22:02 <belkinsa> Go ahead, please introduce yourself.

 22:02 <PaulW2U> Good evening. My name is Paul White, living near Bristol in SW England.

 22:02 <PaulW2U> My Launchpad and Wiki pages are - https://launchpad.net/~paulw2u & https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulW2U

 22:02 <PaulW2U> I started using Ubuntu in May 2010, participating in the forums and reporting bugs, mostly while using the current development version.

 22:03 <PaulW2U> I also test ISOs for Ubuntu and its main flavours from pre-alpha to final release - approaching 400 tests so far.

 22:03 <PaulW2U> My main contribution is my involvement with the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. 69 issues so far, 56 consecutively without a break.

 22:03 <PaulW2U> I started by just writing a few summaries each week but now I also search for links to stories and proof read the final draft prior to release.

 22:03 <PaulW2U> I have often been the sole contributor dealing with the news content before pleia2 or jose add statistics, review and publish.

 22:03 <PaulW2U> That concludes my application. Thank you for your time this evening.

 22:04 <jose> he's a great contributor for sure, he's been definitely been giving a hand a lot lately :)
