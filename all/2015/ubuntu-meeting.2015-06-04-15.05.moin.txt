 15:14 <slangasek> cool, thanks

 15:14 <slangasek> any questions?

 15:15 <slangasek> barry: what are the snappy discussions you're in right now?  python-related, or something else?

 15:15 <barry> slangasek: mostly python related

 15:15 * slangasek nods

 15:15 <barry> i.e. next step in python snaps

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:17 <slangasek> you might all be interested to know that multiple architecture support in scalingstack is coming along

 15:18 <slangasek> I understand we're able to deploy ppc64el compute nodes in the stack, even if they're not allowed to talk to the network afterwards ;)

 15:18 <infinity> That bit's a problem with the openstack setup in Boston in general, not ppc.

 15:18 <infinity> FWIW.

 15:18 <slangasek> so that's exciting and hopefully we'll see more efficient use of our ppc64el hardware soon... as well as our new arm64 hardware coming online for use

 15:18 <infinity> (amd64 instances also can't talk to the world)

 15:18 * slangasek nods

 15:19 <slangasek> infinity: any new updates on that today, or is that the current state?

 15:19 <infinity> Nothing new from me.

 15:19 <slangasek> also, once we have this working on scalingstack, the next step is to do the same in canonistack so that anyone can request a power or arm64 VM when they need it \o/

 15:20 <barry> nice

 15:20 <cyphermox> yay

 15:20 <slangasek> (not in prodstack though, because none of us needs to run our production services on anything but the default architecture in prodstack :)

 15:21 <infinity> Bah.  prodstack will be 100% POWER by the end of 2017.

 15:21 <slangasek> ok, but you still won't get to /request/ a POWER compute node in prodstack ;)

 15:21 <infinity> (Dear irresponsible Linux "journalists", please take the above out of context without noting the sarcasm)

 15:22 <slangasek> it's actually just going to be the result of linguistic drift

 15:22 <slangasek> prodstack -> pordstack -> powrdstack

 15:22 <infinity> porkstack seems a more likely destination.

 15:23 <slangasek> will our DCEs be responsible for basting it as it slowly rotates?

 15:23 <slangasek> anyway

 15:23 <slangasek> anything else? :)

 15:23 <cyphermox> slangasek: one turn cold side, one turn hot side. you need large pork.

 15:24 <cyphermox> nothing else for the meeting ;)

 15:24 <slangasek> #endmeeting
