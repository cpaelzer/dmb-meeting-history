 16:40 <jdstrand> Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:40 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:40 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:40 <jdstrand> I plan to attend UOS, particularly for the core and convergence tracks

 16:41 <jdstrand> then I'm working on the seccomp SRU

 16:41 <jdstrand> (which is in progress)

 16:41 <jdstrand> I've also got an ubuntu-core-security SRU I am preparing

 16:42 <jdstrand> and then need to implement something for seccomp policy regeneration on policy updates for ubuntu core

 16:42 <jdstrand> and review tools updates for snaps

 16:42 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:42 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:42 <mdeslaur> I have a short week as I'm off on thursday

 16:42 <mdeslaur> I'm working on updates, and have a bunch more that are in various stages of testing

 16:43 <mdeslaur> that's about it, sbeattie...

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week.

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'll be keeping an eye on UOS as well

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:43 <sbeattie> I need to harangue mdeslaur or jdstrand to sponsor my rsyslog and apparmor SRUs for trusty.

 16:44 <sbeattie> I also have a pending apparmor upload for wily when it opens

 16:44 <sbeattie> And I need to get on with gcc-pie testing.

 16:45 <sbeattie> That's pretty much my week. tyhicks is out, so jjohansen?

 16:45 <jjohansen> I have next cycle of kernel sign-offs to do this week

 16:46 <jdstrand> sbeattie: are the bugs all ready and you are satisfied with apparmor and rsyslog? I'd be happy to do the pocket copy for you

 16:46 <jjohansen> For apparmor I am still cleaning up the domain transition bits and hunting bugs, improving, extending or writing new regression tests around that

 16:46 <jdstrand> sbeattie: is the apparmor upload a merge of what went to Debian?

 16:46 <jjohansen> jdstrand: infinity will probably do the pocket copy

 16:47 <jjohansen> jdstrand: oops sorry, ignore that

 16:47 <jdstrand> sorry, I'm asking sbeattie questions during your report

 16:47 <jdstrand> I was slow to ask

 16:47 * jjohansen missed the sbeattie bit and thought that was a kernel question

 16:47 * sbeattie waits for jjohansen to finish

 16:47 <jjohansen> heh, well if I had read who you were poking

 16:47 <jjohansen> ...

 16:48 <jjohansen> sbeattie: go

 16:48 <sbeattie> jdstrand: I do need to finish up the paperwork on the SRU bugs.

 16:48 <jdstrand> sbeattie: just ping me when you want me to copy to trusty-proposed

 16:48 <sbeattie> jdstrand: and I haven't looked at the debian upload, I'll do that as well.

 16:48 <jdstrand> sbeattie: what is left on the gcc pie work?

 16:49 <jdstrand> sbeattie: are you ready for me to stop firing questions at you?

 16:49 <sbeattie> jdstrand: I need to do a few more test rebuilds

 16:49 <sbeattie> jdstrand: heh. :)

 16:49 <jdstrand> sbeattie: ah good, so then after that, you can hand to doko?

 16:49 <jdstrand> sbeattie: or is there more?

 16:50 <sbeattie> ah, sorry, one of us needs to do some benchmarking as well.

 16:51 <jdstrand> ok

 16:51 <jdstrand> seems this week your plate is full for benchmarking. we can circle back around to that when tyler is back

 16:52 <sbeattie> okay

 16:52 * jdstrand is done firing questions at sbeattie

 16:52 <jdstrand> sbeattie: thanks :)

 16:53 <jdstrand> jjohansen: ok, feel free to proceed. that said, I have a question for you already

 16:54 <jjohansen> jdstrand: fire

 16:54 <jdstrand> is the 'cleaning up the domain transition bits' part of the upstreaming work?

 16:54 <jjohansen> I think so

 16:55 <jdstrand> ok, good. we'll (and this is for all of the team, not just you/the upstreaming work) need to come up with a plan after tyler gets back for what to focus on

 16:55 <jdstrand> for the cycle

 16:56 <jjohansen> ack

 16:56 <jdstrand> obviously, the upstreaming work is important-- I'd just like to map everything all out

 16:56 <jdstrand> pull people in, etc

 16:56 <jdstrand> anyhoo-- that isn't a question-- just me commenting

 16:56 <jdstrand> jjohansen: please proceed :)

 16:57 <jjohansen> well thats it for me :), sarnold you are up

 16:57 <sarnold> I'm on CVE triage this week; I'll also be checking in on UOS; I'll also be working on testing openstack updates

 16:58 <jdstrand> sarnold: how are the openstack updates going? I saw the question to beisner. are you unblocked?

 16:59 <sarnold> jdstrand: no, his answer is helpful but it doesn't really provide an immediate "do this" kind of answer; the mysql charm bug is https://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/mysql/+bug/1423153 and I didn't see any discussion how to retrieve the password via the juju relations, and I don't know why a five or six week old fix isn't working..

 17:00 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1423153 in percona-cluster (Juju Charms Collection) "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.passwd no longer exist" [High,Fix released]

 17:00 <jdstrand> sarnold: ok, can you follow up with them on irc outside of the meeting?

 17:01 <sarnold> jdstrand: I've asked for information on the bug to find out what the right answer is for finding the password.. if they report back that the answer is to use the relatin-get mechanism, then I think I'm going to file a ahndful of bugs on documentations and go annoy jcastro's stackoverflow answers..

 17:01 <jdstrand> and let me know how I can help unblock you

 17:01 <sarnold> jdstrand: thanks

 17:01 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson ?

 17:01 <jdstrand> that all sounds fine, but let's also make sure we are moving forward

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> so, it's a short week for me this week. I shall be hoping that I don't have to deal with any more issues on arale, so I can get planned work done :)

 17:02 <jdstrand> (which, you are doing the right thing, just want to make sure we don't stall out on email/bug reports/etc)

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> I'm going to be working through code reviews (doing the camera branch right now)

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> and I want to get https://code.launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/oxide/media-permissions in to a state where it can land too

 17:03 <jdstrand> those kinda go hand in hand, right?

 17:03 <chrisccoulson> Sort of - camera works on the desktop already (with the permissions branch)

 17:04 * jdstrand nods

 17:04 <jdstrand> is arale looking ok now?

 17:04 <chrisccoulson> It is. Nobody has pinged me today anyway :)

 17:05 <jdstrand> well, that's a start :)

 17:05 <jdstrand> are there any browser/oxide UOS meetings?

 17:05 <jdstrand> s/meetings/sessions/

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> I also got Firefox 38 building on precise last week with the updated compiler (see gcc-mozilla and hardening-wrapper in https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-security/+archive/ubuntu/ppa and firefox in https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-security/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> That seems to be working ok :)

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> UOS - I'm not sure about that. I haven't checked the schedule

 17:05 <chrisccoulson> I've not scheduled anything

 17:06 <chrisccoulson> Firefox 38 is next week btw

 17:06 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 17:06 <jdstrand> if you could keep an eye out for meetings wrt that, that would be great. if you need one of us to attend in your absence, let us know

 17:07 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: ^

 17:07 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
