 20:01 <elacheche_anis> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:01 <elacheche_anis> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:01 <elacheche_anis> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:01 <elacheche_anis> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:01 <elacheche_anis> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:03 <Kilos> hi ahoneybun

 20:04 <niedbalski> Hello Jorge Niedbalski, I am a developer/sysadmin working daily with Linux since 2001 (mostly Debian). I use Ubuntu as my development and production OS since the precise release (12.04).

 20:04 <niedbalski> My wiki page is: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/niedbalski, My launchpad page is: http://launchpad.net/~niedbalski

 20:04 <elacheche_anis> Welcome niedbalski :)

 20:04 <elacheche_anis> Any questions for niedbalski ?

 20:05 <toddy> niedbalski: Do you make support or something for Ubuntu in your free time or is it all in your working hours by Canonical?

 20:05 <Kilos> niedbalski  why did you take so long to apply for membership?

 20:05 <elacheche_anis> niedbalski, as I can see you're a full time employee @canonical.. Why you're interested to be a Ubuntu Member :)

 20:06 <niedbalski> toddy, I do bug reporting for personal (desktop, server) stuff, such as lightdm or any issue that I found while using the operating system as an user.

 20:06 <niedbalski> Kilos, mostly by ignorance :)

 20:07 <Kilos> np

 20:07 <wxl> niedbalski: do you package for debian?

 20:07 <Kilos> glad you came here now

 20:07 <wxl> niedbalski: are you involved in your loco at all? (not sure where you live)

 20:07 <niedbalski> Kilos, I was not fully aware on this process, or how much time this could take.

 20:07 <toddy> niedbalski: Do you in a LoCo?

 20:09 <niedbalski> wxl, toddy The Loco in Santiago, Chile ( the place I live ) is actually not fully active, but I have participated on a couple of local free/open OS installation sessions supported by the LoCO.

 20:09 <wxl> niedbalski: your participation can always make it more active ;) good to hear!

 20:09 <PabloRubianes> niedbalski: there's any plan to reboot the loco?

 20:09 <PabloRubianes> the loco council could help

 20:09 <elacheche_anis> niedbalski, as I can see you're a full time employee @canonical.. Why you're interested to be a Ubuntu Member :)

 20:10 <niedbalski> elacheche_anis, it is a matter of personal interest, there is no a special relation between my job and this application.

 20:11 <elacheche_anis> Great :)

 20:11 <Kilos> cool, nice to see

 20:11 <toddy> niedbalski: are there many installation sessions? How often are there the sessions? On every release?

 20:12 <niedbalski> toddy, there is a broader event for open-source installation , not only Ubuntu (however it is the most used one) (www.flisol.info) it is a yearly event.

 20:12 <elacheche_anis> I forget to ask if there is any supporters here tonight :)

 20:14 <elacheche_anis> So.. Any more questions? or shall we vote?
