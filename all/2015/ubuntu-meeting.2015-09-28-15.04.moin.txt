 15:04 <Laney> #subtopic bdmurray to setup a pad for the dmb to collaborate on response for noskcaj

 15:05 <Laney> any news?

 15:05 <bdmurray> I ended up creating a bzr branch

 15:05 <Laney> I missed that

 15:05 <Laney> does it have anything useful in?

 15:06 <bdmurray> I don't think so.

 15:06 <Laney> what's next then?

 15:06 <bdmurray> Nope, nothing in it.

 15:08 <bdmurray> I think "micahg to get Noskcaj feedback"

 15:08 <Laney> bit concerned that this drags on

 15:09 <bdmurray> well we could start adding our own feedback then

 15:09 <Laney> right

 15:09 <Laney> I didn't -1 the application but those who did could start to work on it...

 15:10 <Laney> xnox: that includes you

 15:11 <Laney> #subtopic Laney to start an onboarding page for new dmb members

 15:11 <Laney> I didn't do this yet :(

 15:11 <Laney> I am kind of annoyed at myself for not getting around to it

 15:11 <Laney> and I will put it on my calendar for friday afternoon

 15:12 <Laney> done

 15:12 <Laney> #action laney stop slacking and write onboarding page

 15:12 * meetingology laney stop slacking and write onboarding page

 15:12 <Laney> #subtopic michag to confirm if mozc packageset change happened

 15:13 <Laney> did, yes?

 15:13 <Laney> Archive Upload Rights for ubuntu-input-methods-dev: archive 'primary', package set 'input-methods' in wily

 15:13 <Laney> #subtopic michag to follow up with Unit193 about their application and a meeting date

 15:13 <Laney> NFI

 15:13 <Laney> #action michag to follow up with Unit193 about their application and a meeting date

 15:13 * meetingology michag to follow up with Unit193 about their application and a meeting date

 15:14 <bdmurray> I seem to recall that happening but not the outcome.

 15:16 <Laney> can't find any mail anyway

 15:16 <Laney> #topic PPU application: ShuiLu Pi for ubuntukylin-default-settings

 15:16 <Laney> pishuilu: hey, it's now your turn

 15:16 <Laney> can you introduce yourself and your application?

 15:16 <pishuilu> ok

 15:16 <Laney> #chair bdmurray

 15:16 <meetingology> Current chairs: Laney bdmurray

 15:16 <Laney> (brb)

 15:17 <pishuilu> I am a member of Ubuntu Kylin team.

 15:17 <pishuilu> I maintain ubuntukylin-default-settings package.

 15:18 <pishuilu> This package contains a number of system configurations.

 15:19 <pishuilu> For example, firefox search engine and start page, default language for installer images, fix zip fie display of garbage characters

 15:19 <pishuilu> etc

 15:20 <cyphermox> Do you have plans to start maintaining other packages in ubuntukylin, or other packages in general?

 15:20 <xnox> pishuilu: have you come across something that you wanted to customize, but it wasn't in fact customizable at all? Ie. impossible to set some kind of a setting, cause there is no such setting. And how did you resolve such requests?

 15:21 <pishuilu> cyphermox: Now I maintain ubuntukylin-default-settings and ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntukylin package

 15:22 <pishuilu> Later will also maintain other Ubuntu Kylin packages

 15:24 <bdmurray> pishuilu: Could you answer xnox's question?

 15:24 <pishuilu> xnox: Sometimes I should create a script to execute

 15:25 <pishuilu> shell script

 15:26 <pishuilu> Like fix bug LP: #1462848 (fix zip file display of garbage characters)

 15:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1462848 in Ubuntu Kylin "The name of the expanded files for zip file display of garbage characters" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1462848

 15:30 <bdmurray> pishuilu: Have you followed the work in bug 1422290 which seems like it may be a proper fix?

 15:30 <ubottu> bug 1422290 in unzip (Ubuntu) "Default charsets handling for Windows archives in CJKV+th locale" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1422290

 15:30 * xnox ponders if my question got through

 15:30 <xnox> pishuilu: have you come across something that you wanted to customize, but it wasn't in fact customizable at all? Ie. impossible to set some kind of a setting, cause there is no such setting. And how did you resolve such requests?

 15:30 <pishuilu> cyphermox: But I can't maintain all Ubuntu Kylin packages. some packages will be maintained by other colleagues.

 15:31 <cyphermox> of course

 15:34 <bdmurray> pishuilu: have you seen the other questions asked of you by xnox and myself?

 15:34 <pishuilu> bdmurray: I don't follow  bug 1422290. I fix some questions which is not fixed by upstream. If upstream fix this bug ,I will undo this configuration.

 15:34 <ubottu> bug 1422290 in unzip (Ubuntu) "Default charsets handling for Windows archives in CJKV+th locale" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1422290

 15:37 <pishuilu> xnox: sorry , I miss your question.

 15:37 <xnox> pishuilu: have you come across something that you wanted to customize, but it wasn't in fact customizable at all? Ie. impossible to set some kind of a setting, cause there is no such setting. And how did you resolve such requests?

 15:38 <pishuilu> ok

 15:38 * stgraber waves (my phone lied to me)

 15:39 <pishuilu> xnox: I think if it wasn't in fact customizable at all, so this bug is not for this package.

 15:40 <pishuilu> xnox: This package function is system configuration.

 15:40 <xnox> pishuilu: so you never modified anything in ubuntu, or request to be modified in ubuntu to customize stuff??

 15:43 <pishuilu> xnox: I mean configuration is not modifying some package source.

 15:44 <pishuilu> xnox: For exmaple, replace the specific icon

 15:45 <pishuilu> configure defaults.list of applications etc.

 15:50 <bdmurray> pishuilu: Could you comment on happyaron's caveat regarding a need "to be more careful"?

 15:51 <pishuilu> xnox: You mean that modify some package source and submit patches to upstream?

 15:52 <pishuilu> bdmurray: ok

 15:54 <pishuilu> bdmurray: happyaron's caveat mean : when I fix a bug ,I should consider a problem more comprehensively

 15:54 <bdmurray> pishuilu: And what steps are you taking to do that?

 15:57 <pishuilu> When I fix a bug , first I should think this bug's influence of the whole system

 15:58 <pishuilu> so I can consider a problem more comprehensively

 15:59 <bdmurray> Can you give us an example of how you've done that?

 16:00 <pishuilu> Details should be considered in all kinds of unexpected circumstances

 16:01 <pishuilu> For example , fix bug 1462848

 16:01 <ubottu> bug 1462848 in Ubuntu Kylin "The name of the expanded files for zip file display of garbage characters" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1462848

 16:03 <Laney> (I have one when you're finished)

 16:03 <Laney> (then we should wrap up as we're over time already)

 16:03 <pishuilu> I didn't consider the previous zh_CN outside

 16:05 <pishuilu> Laney: I am sorry. Spent so much time !

 16:07 <Laney> It's okay

 16:07 <Laney> bdmurray: you want to ask more?

 16:07 <pishuilu> I should consider zh_CN,zh_TW,zh_HK etc.

 16:08 <bdmurray> Laney: no, that's okay

 16:09 <Laney> ty

 16:09 <Laney> pishuilu: What testing do you do on the package before asking for it to be uploaded?

 16:09 <Laney> Do you test it on a non Chinese system for example?

 16:11 <pishuilu> Laney: I test it on Chinese system.

 16:12 <pishuilu> Because Ubuntu Kylin provide for the use of Chinese users

 16:12 <Laney> I'm worried about cases where I have normal Ubuntu and Ubuntu Kylin installed at the same time

 16:12 <Laney> like if I have a Chinese friend who uses my computer

 16:13 <Laney> I don't want the Kylin settings to break anything on my account

 16:14 <pishuilu> Laney: I see what you mean

 16:16 <pishuilu> Laney: I should make some configurations  effect only in zh_CN.

 16:17 <Laney> yes, you can also look at the $DESKTOP_SESSION environment variable

 16:17 <Laney> it's also valid to be chinese and not use kylin :)

 16:18 <pishuilu> Laney:OK, I know.

 16:18 <pishuilu> Thanks.

 16:18 <Laney> ok, thanks
