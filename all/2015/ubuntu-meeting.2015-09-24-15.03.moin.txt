 15:11 <tdaitx> pitti, nice prototype

 15:11 <barry> just to say, i haven't heard anything about location or confirmation yet

 15:12 <pitti> tdaitx: the joy of AMQP fanout queues, learned about that new toy today :)

 15:12 <caribou> barry I saw it scheduled in Austin, dunno if it is definitive

 15:12 <tdaitx> the doc says austin, tx

 15:12 <pitti> barry: ah, so it's not even clear that we'll have it in that week in the first place?

 15:12 * pitti urgently needs to buy tickets for the systemd conf (or not, if it's in that week and in the US

 15:12 <barry> caribou: ah, cool thanks.  i thought it was likely austin given the new office

 15:12 <pitti> Austin? ok, then definiitvely no double-conf, this is utterly hard to get to

 15:13 <barry> pitti: the last i heard from slangasek, confirmation is still pending, but if it happens it'll be that week

 15:13 <pitti> barry: ack, thanks

 15:13 <barry> #topic AOB

 15:13 <barry> anybody else have anything fun for this week?

 15:13 <cyphermox> still harvesting tomatoes.

 15:14 <pitti> cyphermox: me too! we've had plenty this year with this fantastic summer

 15:14 <cyphermox> indeed.

 15:14 <barry> cyphermox: i'm jealous.  i was just telling pitti how weak our tomato harvest was this year

 15:14 <cyphermox> and cucumbers were going quite well too.

 15:14 <barry> beautiful fall weather tho, so i'm working out on the porch today

 15:15 <cyphermox> lucky

 15:15 <cyphermox> that's all I have in OB anyway :)

 15:15 <barry> cool, anyone else?

 15:16 <cyphermox> oh actually

 15:16 <cyphermox> if someone with SRU powers could review the grub SRU in trusty queue

 15:17 <barry> so, dates are locked down, but location is still tbd with austin the current target
