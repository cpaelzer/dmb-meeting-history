 15:08 <tdaitx> slangasek, will do, thanks =)

 15:09 <cyphermox> oh, and I forgot, some citrain babysitting

 15:09 <infinity> tdaitx: Yeah, I came to the same conclusion, so my issue is elsewhere. :P

 15:09 <bdmurray> updated retracer.py not to log the swift token as it is noisy in the logs

 15:10 <bdmurray> âœ” done

 15:10 <sil2100> bdmurray: \o/ thanks!

 15:10 <pitti> autopkgtest: Teach britney and autopkgtest about supporting running kernel-related tests (DKMS, LXC, etc.) on multiple kernels. This requires keeping track of test triggers, calculating/triggering reverse dependencies on supported architectures only, some rewiring of britney's logic, exposing runtime kernel information in the results, etc. We are 90% there, then we have fully automatic regression

 15:10 <pitti> testing on all supported releases and kernels. While painful, this also led to some much more robust concepts and code in britney.

 15:10 <pitti> apport: Work on yet undisclosed security issue

 15:10 <pitti> misc:

 15:10 <pitti> - fix broken chef, puppet, and crash autopkgtests

 15:10 <pitti> - python-dbusmock: Review/merge pete-wood's NetworkManager template improvement, land it in all places

 15:10 <pitti> - Update SRU policy proposals, send new proposals to TB list

 15:10 <pitti> ^D

 15:10 <sil2100> I now need to get the livecd-rootfs hack back for the overlay...

 15:10 <infinity> - Kernel SRU wrangling

 15:10 <infinity> - Planning release sprint

 15:10 <infinity> - Hunting glibc test regressions

 15:10 <infinity> - Fixed a dpkg trigger loop in software-center

 15:10 <infinity> - More s390x meetings, planning, and bootstrapping

 15:10 <infinity> (done)

 15:12 <slangasek> * interviews

 15:12 <slangasek> * s390 recruiting attempts

 15:12 <slangasek> * a bit of cdimage handholding for a snappy image release

 15:12 <slangasek> * discussions about how to help get juju-core into main for 15.10

 15:12 <slangasek> * minor consulting on the pocket desktop seed

 15:12 <slangasek> * next week:

 15:12 <slangasek> * out on vacation

 15:12 <slangasek> (done)

 15:12 <slangasek> questions on status?

 15:14 <slangasek> [TOPIC] team sprint

 15:14 <slangasek> just a quick status update for everyone

 15:14 <slangasek> planning on this is still in progress.. we are still targeting the first week in November

 15:15 <caribou> during UOS ?

 15:15 <slangasek> however it looks like we'll probably move continents, Bluefin is already booked up that week

 15:15 <slangasek> caribou: correct

 15:15 <barry> slangasek: awesome, i've never been to antartica!

 15:15 <infinity> slangasek: Asia? :)

 15:15 <slangasek> trolls, I'm surrounded by trolls

 15:15 <sil2100> Asia would be nice

 15:15 <slangasek> so, we're looking at locations in the US

 15:15 * bdmurray weeps

 15:15 <infinity> Boourns.

 15:16 <caribou> yep was a good Rock group

 15:16 <slangasek> as soon as we have something locked in, you'll get an email

 15:16 <cyphermox> :/

 15:16 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:16 <slangasek> anything else today?

 15:17 <infinity> I suppose I should have done the stgraber thing and announced my upcoming travel.

 15:17 <infinity> I'll be in SF for Connect next week, and in Detroit for $reasons the week after (working, though).

 15:17 <pitti> US> bummer for conf overlap with Berlin :/

 15:17 <bdmurray> I'll be out at a conference a couple of days (W, Th) next week.

 15:18 <slangasek> infinity: yeah, doko is there next week too

 15:18 <infinity> slangasek: Connect, I hope, not Detroit.  The latter could get awakward.

 15:18 <infinity> awkward, too.

 15:18 * slangasek gives infinity an awk award

 15:19 * infinity goes awakward toward all the waks.

 15:19 <cyphermox> are there sed awards too?

 15:19 <infinity> cyphermox: The sed award is usually "you should have used awk".

 15:19 <slangasek> infinity: heresy

 15:19 <infinity> I stand by it.

 15:20 <slangasek> right, anything else?
