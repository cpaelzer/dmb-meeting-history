 15:03 <Laney> #startmeeting DMB 2015-02-16

 15:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Mon Feb 16 15:03:35 2015 UTC.  The chair is Laney. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:03 <meetingology> 

 15:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:03 <Laney> greetings

 15:04 <Laney> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:04 <Laney> #subtopic Extend DD PPU to cover DM too (Laney)

 15:04 <Laney> sorry I didn't do this :(

 15:04 <Laney> #action Laney to amend https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess#Debian_Developers_applying_for_Per-Package_upload_rights to apply to DM too

 15:04 * meetingology Laney to amend https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess#Debian_Developers_applying_for_Per-Package_upload_rights to apply to DM too

 15:05 <Laney> #subtopic Status of Jackson Doak's (email) application

 15:05 <Laney> umm...

 15:05 <Laney> AFAIK only ScottK and I have voted for this one

 15:05 <Laney> what's preventing the rest of you?

 15:05 <Laney> (he keeps pinging)

 15:08 <xnox> Laney: i'm siding between -1 or 0 (obstaining)

 15:09 <Laney> just vote, whatever it is :-)

 15:09 <xnox> Laney: unfortunately, I think I'm biased on this application due to past experience with Jackson. Maybe it can get a fresh look with newly elected DMB members.

 15:09 <xnox> (it being his application)

 15:10 * bdrung_work has a too huge email backlog.

 15:11 <Laney> bleh

 15:11 <Laney> please find the time, not fair to make people wait for this long

 15:11 <Laney> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 15:12 * bdrung_work has to find the email thread

 15:12 <Laney> #topic utlemming's application for PPU and Cloud Image Package set

 15:12 <Laney> utlemming: yo

 15:12 <Laney> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/utlemming/PackageSet

 15:12 <utlemming> Hello :)

 15:12 <Laney> can you briefly introduce your application?

 15:12 <utlemming> Sure

 15:13 <utlemming> The purpouse of this package set is to support the use of Ubuntu Cloud Images and there use

 15:13 <utlemming> For some time we have been producing Cloud Images that work on Vagrant, as well as watching after tooling

 15:13 <utlemming> This package set was put together to watch after that use case.

 15:15 <Laney> looks like these are packages which you use to work with various clouds/instances from the outside, rather than stuff which is actually installed in the images themselves, right?

 15:16 <utlemming> A little bit of both, actually

 15:16 <utlemming> Open-vm-tools and Virtualbox have compotents that get installed in the images.

 15:16 <utlemming> While Vagrant and the API tools are used to manipulate a running instance.

 15:17 <utlemming> WALinuxAgent is used for bootstrapping Windows Azure instances.

 15:17 <utlemming> And Cloud-init it is the real meet of a cloud-image. I try to get all the special sauce for the Cloud-images into Cloud-init.

 15:19 <Laney> ack

 15:19 <Laney> bdrung_work / xnox / stgraber: any qs at this point?

 15:21 <bdrung_work> utlemming, is there any collaboration between Debian and Ubuntu on these packages?

 15:21 <xnox> utlemming: what is the overlap between "traditional" cloud-init cloud image and a snappy image?

 15:21 <xnox> utlemming: or rather overlap between proposed packageset and snappy images.

 15:22 <utlemming> bdrung_work: great question -- the short answer is that I have tried to work with Debian on that. I have reached out multiple times on WALinuxAgent. However, Microsoft considers us the upstream on that. I have been working with the Vagrant community, to get some changes upstream to Debian.

 15:24 <utlemming> xnox: there is a little overlap for Snappy. Cloud-init is core to snappy, and _all_ the special sauce needs to be there. We are trying to roll everything into Cloud-init to support Snappy. For example, I am working with VMware to try to get Snappy support.

 15:26 <xnox> utlemming: how do you perform testing, especially for something like cloud-init which has a huge test-matrix given number of ubuntu releases X environment types X environment providers?

 15:26 <xnox> anything you can share to achive good coverage? And does it benefit other parts of Ubuntu? (e.g. Core)

 15:28 <utlemming> xnox: automation...there is simply no other way. I've been working to expose that information publicaly (i.e. cloud.qa.ubuntu.com just appeared two weeks ago [thanks stgraber]). The team is working on building images from proposed, and starting with 15.04, images are being built in Launchpad.

 15:29 <utlemming> xnox: right now we build cloud imags based on archive changes, and we are going to get that extended to building from proposed. The vision is to spot when a change in the -proposed pocket happens and then kick a build to automated testing. From there, we will have a process that flags when something goes wrong.

 15:30 <utlemming> xnox: and for the kernel, we are actively working with the kernel team to pre-test changes before the kernel even hits -proposed on all the major clouds.

 15:31 <xnox> very good.

 15:31 <Laney> #chair xnox

 15:31 <meetingology> Current chairs: Laney xnox

 15:31 <Laney> (brb)

 15:31 <utlemming> xnox: the benefit here to core is that the cloud gives us the flexiability and "elastisity" to be able to spot problems before they ever hit the archive. My goal is to make sure that Ubuntu -proposed is stable for our Cloud users and by extension, the server, core and desktop users (as far as the overlap goes)

 15:31 <xnox> Laney: wtf?! =)

 15:33 <xnox> stgraber: any questions from you?

 15:34 <stgraber> nope

 15:35 <xnox> bdrung_work: ?

 15:35 * xnox is lingering time until laney is back.

 15:35 * xnox is out of questions

 15:36 <Laney> utlemming: We like to have each packageset have a description that allows you to come back to the DMB via email in future when you want new packages added

 15:36 <Laney> So that we can say 'ah yes, this fits' and add stuff with no fuss

 15:36 <Laney> can we come up with one for the cloud set?

 15:36 <utlemming> Laney: how about "Packages for the creation and use of Ubuntu Cloud Images and derivatives"?

 15:38 <bdrung_work> utlemming, how you decide the set of clouds to test Ubuntu on? what is needed to run tests on a new cloud?

 15:40 <Laney> "Packages required to create, bootstrap, use or configure Ubuntu Cloud images and their derivatives"?

 15:40 <utlemming> bdrung_work: generally, if the cloud is automatable and we have accounts. AWS, Azure, GCE and Openstack (which cover the vast majority of instances) are the prime clouds. If we can create an instance and then throw it away and get the results, we'll test on it.

 15:40 <utlemming> Laney: I like your description better :)

 15:41 <Laney> great

 15:41 <Laney> I'm done with qs

 15:45 <Laney> bdrung_work: xnox: stgraber: more questions? or vote?

 15:46 <stgraber> I'm ready to vote

 15:48 <Laney> right

 15:48 <Laney> silence is assent from the rest of you
