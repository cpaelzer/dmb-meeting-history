 16:12 <xnox> doko, it did do 4k builds already. they are cloning that builder at the moment to get more going.

 16:12 <slangasek> xnox: 4k?  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+builds?build_text=&build_state=built&arch_tag=s390x shows only 154 successful builds

 16:12 <chiluk> Working on 1432871 coreutils ftbfs - Turns out the testcase needed to be updated.  None of the testcases were being run prior because df would fail to read the mount table, and thus were auto-skipped.  The root issue appears to still exist upstream.  debdiff that fixes the failing testcase is waiting in 1432871 for upload and SRU approval.

 16:12 <chiluk> http://pad.lv/1347788 - Fix exists on unstable branch.  May consider moving xenial tun unstable find-utils like fedora, centos, and suse.

 16:16 <slangasek> any questions over status?

 16:20 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:20 <slangasek> pitti, xnox: could we sync quickly regarding autopkgtest on s390x?

 16:21 <pitti> we did in a PM, but sure, let's repeat here

 16:21 <slangasek> (here, or after meeting)

 16:21 <pitti> so my "minimal must have" requirements are:

 16:21 <pitti> - deboostrap works

 16:21 <slangasek> pitti: we haven't all three of us synced in a PM ;)

 16:21 <pitti> - LXC works

 16:21 <pitti> - I get at least 15 CPUs and 30 GB of RAM to have enough capacity to keep up

 16:21 <pitti> (preferably distributed over two VM instances, or perhaps 4

 16:22 <xnox> that.

 16:22 <pitti> there's a longer list of things which make this nicer (boot loader for vmdeboostrap and QEMU, cloud images,  scalingstack etc.), but that's not critical

 16:22 <xnox> slangasek, once debootstrap works and lxc works, and like i can run one autopkgtest successfully the request will be to get machine(s) access to pitti to hook the rest of things up.

 16:23 <slangasek> pitti: so one thing I heard said earlier was that we maybe didn't want to turn on autopkgtest gating for s390x until more is built because otherwise things will fail due to dependencies

 16:23 <slangasek> and I disagree with that

 16:23 <pitti> why wouldn't we do that?

 16:23 <pitti> we only hold back on regressions, not on failures

 16:23 <pitti> and we now track regression vs. alwaysfail per-arch

 16:23 <pitti> why wouldn't we enable normal gating, I mean

 16:23 <xnox> slangasek, i never said anything about disabling gating...

 16:23 <slangasek> I think we should turn on gating sooner rather than later

 16:24 <slangasek> xnox: ok, that's what I heard, so I wanted to be clear :)

 16:24 <pitti> so even if all tests fail initially, that just won't catch regressions, but not hold anything back

 16:24 <xnox> slangasek, in that case - when can we have autopkgtest machines provisioned? =)

 16:24 <xnox> and shall those just be clones of buildds ?! =)

 16:24 <slangasek> xnox: I don't know; we need to talk to kip/tinoco/cpaezler

 16:25 <xnox> (well, autopkgtest need different network and firewall, so assume it's not the same as lp-buildds)

 16:25 <slangasek> the buildds aren't done with the same VM config we requested for autopkgtest

 16:25 <xnox> slangasek, and by we you mean I, or You? =)

 16:25 <slangasek> xnox: yes

 16:25 <slangasek> anyway

 16:25 <xnox> lovely.

 16:26 <slangasek> assuming there are no hang-ups on the VM provisioning side, I think we should be aiming to have autopkgtest enabled for s390x by early next week

 16:26 <xnox> ack.

 16:26 <slangasek> since a lot of packages are getting built right now, and this may be our one chance to *get* a baseline for their test results in xenial

 16:27 <slangasek> unless pitti has another idea about how to get baseline results en masse, after the packages have already built+migrated to xenial?

 16:27 <xnox> i assume we can retrigger testing of all -release pocket on s390x.

 16:27 <pitti> slangasek: we can trigger the tests against -release too

 16:28 <xnox> and if they pass, that will become the baseline.

 16:28 <slangasek> ok

 16:28 <pitti> britney won't do it for us of course, but it's easy enough to come up with a list of run-autopkgtest commands to do it

 16:28 <slangasek> then that's probably a good idea to do, and then we don't have to worry so much about the timing of the autopkgtest bring-up

 16:28 <slangasek> I still want us to get that ASAP however :)

 16:28 <pitti> i. e. we grab s390x Packages.gz, and issue a request for all packages that we built

 16:29 <slangasek> [ACTION] slangasek and xnox to pursue s390x VMs for autopkgtesting before next week

 16:29 * meetingology slangasek and xnox to pursue s390x VMs for autopkgtesting before next week

 16:30 <slangasek> alrighty

 16:30 <slangasek> xnox: and nice work getting s390x going

 16:31 <xnox> thank you, there is a lot of stuff to fix still.

 16:31 <slangasek> I'd congratulate infinity too but I'm glad he's elsewhere :)

 16:31 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:32 <xnox> well him, colin and william did the black magic of bring up first buildd and that was dandy.

 16:32 <doko> heh, its disabled now

 16:33 <slangasek> the builder? it's torn down for cloning

 16:33 <doko> but I like the build times, some under 1min

 16:33 <slangasek> they'll be making 28 of them shortly

 16:34 <slangasek> probably the easiest new arch bring-up ever, at least once the hardware is in place ;)

 16:35 <pitti> and it seems we've got plenty this time

 16:35 <pitti> I still remember the scarcity of arm back then

 16:35 <cyphermox> doesn't take much mainframe to split up into chunks that are useful

 16:35 <slangasek> yes, there's generally no shortage of server-grade zSeries hardware

 16:36 <slangasek> obviously what we should do is move all of prodstack onto the z13
