 16:12 <arosales> rbasak: thanks

 16:12 <rbasak> I'm (still) working on MySQL 5.6. I think it'll make it though.

 16:15 <arosales> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:15 <caribou> arosales: nothing on my radar for this week

 16:15 <arosales> caribou: ok, thanks for joining

 16:15 <arosales> #info no agenda items for Server & Cloud Bugs

 16:16 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:16 <hallyn> ok, so,

 16:16 <hallyn> should we drop this item?  we no longer have a contact point, really,

 16:17 <hallyn> beisner: ^ do you want to take on this topic?

 16:17 <hallyn> you can bring up any known outstanding failures...

 16:17 <beisner> hi all

 16:17 <hallyn> in which case arosales should take an action to change this ^ in the agenda :)

 16:17 <beisner> matsubara and I have been working to review the tests in the CI and QA teams which are server-centric.

 16:17 <arosales> if beisner agrees I certainly can :-)

 16:18 <beisner> there is a transition happening now on that, so no news to report atm.

 16:18 <hallyn> "(beisner|matsubara)" perhaps

 16:18 <arosales> #action [arosales] update QA contact to beisner | matsubara

 16:18 * meetingology [arosales] update QA contact to beisner | matsubara

 16:18 <hallyn> beisner: thanks

 16:18 <beisner> yes i'd say it is safe to remove psivaa

 16:18 <beisner> thank you

 16:18 <arosales> #action beisner | matsubara confirm QA contact

 16:18 * meetingology beisner | matsubara confirm QA contact

 16:18 <arosales> beisner: thanks for the update

 16:19 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:19 <smb> Nothing from the kernel side right now. From the Xen side the last libvirt update caused some new issues which I will fix. Ideally when rebuilding libvirt and qemu after moving Xen to 4.5. Not sure I get the final review done before FF.

 16:19 <hallyn> smb: there's an issue with vlans in trusty 3.13 kernel, fwiw

 16:19 <smb> hallyn, got a bug #

 16:19 <hallyn> not yet, asked thereporter if he minded opening a bug

 16:19 <hallyn> just a heads-up

 16:20 <smb> hallyn, ok thanks

 16:20 <hallyn> smb,

 16:20 <hallyn> what does "Ideally when rebuilding libvirt and qemu after moving Xen to 4.5." mean?

 16:20 * smb thinks he is using vlans with trusty

 16:20 <hallyn> are you asking for us to do something different when uplaoding those?

 16:21 <smb> hallyn, Just that I have to do no-change-rebuild after updating xen

 16:21 <hallyn> oh, ok - thx.  btw, https://lists.linuxcontainers.org/pipermail/lxc-users/2015-February/008542.html

 16:21 <smb> hallyn, Though a quick ping on irc when changing libvirt or qemu would be nice as well

 16:21 <hallyn> (is the original vlan bug report)

 16:22 <hallyn> smb: ok.

 16:22 <smb> hallyn, it was a bit like playing whack-a-dpkg to keep my ppa current lately ;)

 16:22 <arosales> smb: thanks for the update.

 16:23 <arges> hallyn: bug 1410852 ^^

 16:23 <ubottu> bug 1410852 in lxc "restarting container with a vlan interface results in kernel stack trace" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1410852

 16:23 <arges> is that it?

 16:23 <arosales> hallyn: may I give you an action to follow up on the issues with vlan in trusty 3.13 bug with smb?

 16:23 <arosales> or is that the one from arges :-)

 16:24 <hallyn> arosales: i'm just asking for it to be reproted against th ekernel :)

 16:24 <arges> hallyn: i can target that bug to linux, if that's the right one

 16:24 <hallyn> arges: looks like same bug, different reporter

 16:24 <arosales> hallyn: understood

 16:24 <arges> hallyn: ack

 16:24 <hallyn> arges: cool, thanks

 16:25 <arosales> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events
