 16:34 <tyhicks> Thanks to you all for your assistance in keeping Ubuntu secure! :)

 16:35 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:35 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:36 <jdstrand> hopefully today I will finish the big review tools update that will make the store and packages work as well for snappy apps and frameworks as for clicks

 16:36 <jdstrand> that got delayed a bit last week due to store api changes and LP being down (I wanted to pull down everything from the store and compare existing tools with trunk)

 16:36 <jdstrand> that's all resolved, just need to go through the output now

 16:38 <jdstrand> I've been working quite a bit on processes surrounding security support for system-image variants of Ubuntu (eg, touch and core)

 16:38 <jdstrand> that will continue

 16:38 <jdstrand> there is work planning with tyhicks

 16:39 <jdstrand> and I hope to at least start if not finish (for wily) handling seccomp policy upgrades on snappy

 16:39 <jdstrand> which will then need an SRU, at which point I will also do an SRU for ubuntu-core-security. that SRU work is likely next week

 16:39 <jdstrand> I have two embargoed items

 16:41 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I guess I'm up

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I'm about to publish an ipsec-tools update for precise

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and I have some openssl updates that will be going out today that disable export ciphers

 16:42 <mdeslaur> after that, I'll be working on testing an apache2 update for precise that backports ecc support and better dh handling

 16:42 <mdeslaur> I also have some qt updates to test

 16:42 <mdeslaur> I am also looking into a glibc tzdata regression that is causing mercurial to FTBFS on 32 bit platforms

 16:42 <mdeslaur> that's it from me, sbeattie, you're up

 16:42 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'm working through the backlog of outstanding apparmor patch reviews.

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'm also working on testing for the apparmor trusty SRU

 16:44 <sbeattie> I still have the gcc pie work on my plate.

 16:44 <mdeslaur> mmm....pie

 16:44 <mdeslaur> (that joke never gets old)

 16:44 <sbeattie> and I have an nbd updtae simmering on the back burner.

 16:45 * sbeattie takes a note to use cooking analogies for all his future status reports)

 16:45 <sbeattie> that's it for me. tyhicks?

 16:45 <tyhicks> sbeattie: is it still possible to land the PIE change for wily?

 16:46 <sbeattie> I think so, yes.

 16:46 <tyhicks> ok

 16:46 <tyhicks> I'm handling bug triage this week

 16:46 <mdeslaur> oh, I have something else I forgot to mention

 16:46 <tyhicks> go for it

 16:47 <mdeslaur> I plan on uploading bash to wily today with the setuid privilege dropping re-enabled, and I plan on looking at taviso's patch for dash to do the same

 16:47 <tyhicks> oh cool

 16:47 <sbeattie> \o/

 16:48 <sarnold> yay :)

 16:48 <tyhicks> I plan on helping out with security updates this week

 16:48 <tyhicks> I will return to working on adding kernel keyring mediation support to AppArmor parser

 16:49 <tyhicks> hopefully wrap up work planning tasks

 16:49 <tyhicks> and I have a few embargoed items

 16:50 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:50 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:50 <jjohansen> I need to finish up dealing with 2.10 patch review and replies, so we can get 2.10 out the door.

 16:51 <jjohansen> Finish up with the kernel security sign-offs

 16:51 <jjohansen> Figure out what we are doing for LSS (if anything)

 16:51 <jjohansen> Sync up on dconf mediation

 16:52 <jjohansen> Continue with the kernel patch cleanup

 16:52 <jjohansen> and I have an embargoed item or two

 16:53 <tyhicks> jjohansen: can you send your fix for bug #1430546 to the kteam this week? (I'm assuming it is just a git send-email away)

 16:53 <ubottu> bug 1430546 in linux (Ubuntu) "apparmor kernel BUG kills firefox" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430546

 16:54 <jjohansen> tyhicks: yes

 16:54 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:54 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:54 <sarnold> I'm on cve triage this week; I'm also going to continue going through open openstack issues and figuring out which ones are still needing attention; I'll also try to handle a few apparmor patch reviews.

 16:54 <sarnold> I think that's it for me

 16:54 <sarnold> chrisccoulson?

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> I'm hoping for chromium updates this week

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> Also, I need to spend some time on Firefox - a recent change upstream has broken the way we handle localized search plugins in our packaging

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> I got an email last week (I think it got sent to everyone with an account on addons.mozilla.org) with details of addon signing in Firefox

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> It had a link to https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing

 16:57 <tyhicks> I was about to ask if you have heard anything about that :)

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> (the tl;dr version - we need to get our addons reviewed and signed)

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> In Firefox 40, unsigned addons will be disabled (but there'll be a pref to override)

 16:58 <chrisccoulson> in Firefox 41, there'll be no override

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> I tried getting ubufox reviewed, but the automatic part of the process compains that we override the startpage (something which is prohibited in addons, but is the whole point of our customizations)

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> So I'm not confident we'll get that through a manual review

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> and then, webapps.....

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> Anyway

 17:00 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I'll be working on stuff from https://launchpad.net/oxide/+milestone/branch-1.9

 17:00 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 17:01 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: dbarth's team will handle the webapps reviews?

 17:02 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: who should handle the "Ubuntu Online Accounts" review?

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> tyhicks, I'm not sure. The experience with that addon is so bad currently, I wonder whether it's worth the effort (but I guess that's up to dbarth's team)

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> tyhicks, that would be dbarth too

 17:02 <tyhicks> ok

 17:03 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: lets make sure they're aware of the newly released details in tomorrow's oxide meeting

 17:03 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 17:03 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 17:03 <tyhicks> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.
