 16:00 <kickinz1> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Jan  6 16:00:09 2015 UTC.  The chair is kickinz1. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:01 <kickinz1> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <coreycb> o/

 16:01 <matsubara> o/

 16:01 <kickinz1> seems there is an action point, seems done right?

 16:03 <kickinz1> SO I go to Vivid dev?

 16:03 <coreycb> kickinz1, you may want to paste the action point.  I'm not seeing logs from the last meeting.

 16:04 <kickinz1> ok

 16:04 <kickinz1> Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:04 <kickinz1> matsubara to chase someone that can update release bugs report: http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-v-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:04 <kickinz1> I filed https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-website/+bug/1398443 for this, which has been fixed by Brian Murray and the report now works -- 2014-12-02 matsubara

 16:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1398443 in Ubuntu QA Website "rls-v-tracking missing for Vivid" [Undecided,Fix released]

 16:04 <arges> o/

 16:04 <gaughen> o/

 16:04 <matsubara> kickinz1, that's been sorted out in the previous meeting

 16:04 <kickinz1> sorry..

 16:05 <kickinz1> #topic Vivid Development

 16:05 <hallyn> kickinz1: not your fault, last person should have updated it.  please do so this time

 16:05 <kickinz1> ok I'll  do

 16:05 <hallyn> thanks :)

 16:05 <kickinz1> So anything related to vivid?

 16:06 <hallyn> I need to talk to stgraber but it loks like we're going to track lxd through github milestones/issues rather than blueprint

 16:06 <kickinz1> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <kickinz1> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <coreycb> that tag may be broken, we can look at the url on our own

 16:07 <gaughen> sorry kickinz1 I think that was me that should have updated the action, and I actually thought I did

 16:08 <gaughen> our next big date for the release is feature freeze - Feb 19

 16:08 <coreycb> or maybe link isn't supposed to do anything (ignore me)

 16:08 <kickinz1> the #link is in the command list...

 16:09 <kickinz1> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <kickinz1> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-v-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:10 <kickinz1> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-v-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:12 <gaughen> maybe the meeting tool doesn't like a french '#' kickinz1 ;-)

 16:13 <gaughen> coreycb, kickinz1 is that link working for you? I'm getting a blank page

 16:13 <coreycb> it's dead for me

 16:13 <gaughen> anyhow, I'm not aware of any major show stoppers right now, so we can move on to blueprints

 16:13 <kickinz1> So link doesn't work, replacing reqorts by reports doesn't seem do to anything, I'll look into ot after

 16:13 <gaughen> although I would say one thing on my mind is the move to systemd this cycle

 16:14 <gaughen> we need to carve out some time to make sure the services that are server image specific are  happy

 16:14 <gaughen> and we need to do that this month

 16:14 <gaughen> anyhow, kickinz1 you can move us along with your fancy french #s ;-)

 16:14 <kickinz1> ok

 16:15 <kickinz1> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:15 <kickinz1> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-v/group/topic-v-server.html

 16:15 <gaughen> kickinz1, I've been trying to make sure our blueprints are in a good state. as usual they need love. But I will continue to work that.

 16:16 <gaughen> and as hallyn mentioned the plan will be to track lxd not in blueprints but on github

 16:16 <kickinz1> ok

 16:16 <gaughen> smoser, we need to get a cloud-init blueprint in shape for the python3 rebase

 16:16 <gaughen> anyhow, that is all kickinz1

 16:16 <smoser> gaughen, agreed.

 16:17 <kickinz1> So going to SErver and Cloud

 16:17 <kickinz1> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:17 <gaughen> it worked kickinz1!

 16:17 <caribou> kickinz1: nothing particular here

 16:17 <kickinz1> ok

 16:17 <kickinz1> thanks caribou

 16:17 <kickinz1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:18 <kickinz1> psivaa_ ?

 16:19 <kickinz1> So next

 16:19 <kickinz1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:19 <arges> the kernel is perfect and no bugs exist. : )

 16:19 <kickinz1> :)

 16:20 <beisner> kickinz1, plz add action item for me:   establish new qa-team point of contact for server team

 16:20 <arges> feel free to let us know of any issues as usual

 16:20 <psivaa_> kickinz1: sorry i am no longer in the QA team. besigner was inthe process of finding a QA rep

 16:20 <kickinz1> ok thanks psivaa_

 16:21 <kickinz1> thanks arges

 16:21 <kickinz1> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:22 <kickinz1> A new team member with the nickname tmoser ?

 16:22 <gaughen> kickinz1, yes!

 16:23 <gaughen> kickinz1, but otherwise I'm not aware of any upcoming events.

 16:23 <kickinz1> ok I move on
