 16:41 <tyhicks> Thanks to Thomas Ward (teward) for help on security updates (14.04 and 14.10) for the community supported putty (LP: #1467631) last week. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:41 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:41 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I'm about to publish an embargoed issue in a half hour

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and I'm currently working on php5 updates

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I have a ca-certificates issue to look into

 16:42 <mdeslaur> and this week is a short week because of a national holiday on wednesday

 16:42 <mdeslaur> that's it for me this week

 16:42 <mdeslaur> sbeattie, you're up

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week

 16:43 <sbeattie> I'm poking again at gcc-pie

 16:44 <sbeattie> and I've got more apparmor patches to review.

 16:44 <sbeattie> that's pretty much my week

 16:44 <sbeattie> tyhicks: all yours

 16:44 <tyhicks> I've got an embargoed issue

 16:45 <tyhicks> oh, I'm on bug triage this week

 16:45 <tyhicks> I have some work tracking improvements to do for better integration with the ubuntu-cve-tracker

 16:45 <tyhicks> and I hope to get back to AppArmor userspace support for kernel keyring mediation

 16:45 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:45 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:47 <sarnold> oh man you guys went quickly :)

 16:47 <sarnold> I'm on CVE triage this week

 16:48 <sarnold> I'm also working on the ppc64-diag follow-on MIR audits

 16:48 <sarnold> I might also handle a few smaller apparmor patch reviews

 16:48 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I've got Mozilla updates this week. I also need to get Oxide 1.7.9 published, and I'm expecting Chromium too

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I've got to do some work to make the Firefox packaging buildable again as well

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I'll be working through Oxide bugs. I'm currently working on bug 1410753, which I have an initial working implementation of (https://code.launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/oxide/new-user-agent-override-api)
