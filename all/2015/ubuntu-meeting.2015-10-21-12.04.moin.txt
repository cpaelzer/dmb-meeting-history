 12:04 <Kilos> hi dupingping FrozenZia

 12:04 <dupingping> hi, Kilos

 12:04 <dupingping> I am here.

 12:05 <marcoceppi> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for October 21, 2015.

 12:05 <marcoceppi> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:05 <marcoceppi> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:05 <marcoceppi> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:05 <marcoceppi> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:05 <marcoceppi> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:05 <marcoceppi> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers amounts to at least +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:06 <marcoceppi> #votesrequired 4

 12:06 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed

 12:07 <marcoceppi> #voters popey marcoceppi Kilos IdleOne hggdh belkinsa

 12:07 <marcoceppi> Now, without any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:07 <marcoceppi> #subtopic FrozenZia

 12:07 <popey> I'm glad you know how to operate this bot marcoceppi :)

 12:08 <FrozenZia> Right, so Paul Brown, native of New Mexico originally, moved to Finland after a year as an exchange student.

 12:08 <Kilos> yeah me too

 12:08 <marcoceppi> well, except for subtopic didn't seem to  work :\

 12:08 <marcoceppi> Welcome FrozenZia!

 12:08 <FrozenZia> Zia is an indian symbol from the NM state flag, and being here in Finland nowadays, well, that's where FrozenZia came from.

 12:09 <FrozenZia> Here's the Wiki link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulVinsonBrown

 12:09 <FrozenZia> I've basically been spending the last 4ish years trying to refurbish old computers, install Ubuntu on them, and sell them / donate them forward.

 12:10 <FrozenZia> That's the very shortest version of the story, really.

 12:11 <FrozenZia> Had an email from Walter Lapchynski pointing out that my contributions to the actual Ubuntu *project* in terms of bug reports, translating, code, etc...

 12:11 <FrozenZia> has actually been very close to zero, but that for all that's lacking there I have done plenty of ADVOCACY.

 12:11 <dupingping> Hi, everybody.

 12:12 <marcoceppi> FrozenZia: I see you've done translation for Code Club World, which is awesome! Have you looked at doing translations for the Ubuntu projects?

 12:12 <FrozenZia> I'm very much interested in doing more, but time time time...

 12:12 <FrozenZia> marcoceppi: yes and no.

 12:13 <FrozenZia> The few times I've looked at it, I've maybe gotten to the "first steps" page, and then got distracted with some other project, etc...

 12:14 <FrozenZia> Don't really know at this point how really *easy* or *diffictult* it is to get started translating, but suggested that at OggCamp in Liverpool at the end of the month I'd be willing to try and organize a sort of "translating for newbies" workshop or something.

 12:15 <FrozenZia> Problem being it'd be a blind leading the blind sort of situation at this point.

 12:15 <marcoceppi> FrozenZia: I've found often teaching is the best way to learn something ;)

 12:15 <marcoceppi> FrozenZia: have you been in contact with the Finland loco at all?

 12:15 <FrozenZia> marcoceppi: so true. so very true.

 12:16 <popey> I would prefer to see the testimonials on the page if possible, rather than emails to us, but that's just a personal preference.

 12:16 <FrozenZia> marcoceppi: well, other than a few posts in the Finnish forums, not really -- have been disheartened there didn't seem to be much *local* activity (I'm *not* in Helsinki), and the

 12:17 <FrozenZia> Tampere crowd has been meeting Wednesday nites which haven't worked for my schedule.

 12:17 <Kilos> FrozenZia what was the problem of getting your testimonials that went to our mailing list on your wiki page

 12:17 <FrozenZia> popey: Yeah, I just had people to ask for testimonials that would have found registering to be able to update the wiki "beyond them".

 12:18 <Kilos> ah

 12:18 <popey> Yeah, the wiki is obtuse for beginners

 12:18 <FrozenZia> Even Vagrant, who is very capable, commented that he didn't know if he'd ever edited the Ubuntu Wiki and so I sent him the e-mail-address option.

 12:19 <popey> ok.

 12:19 <popey> My main concern is the lack of direct measurable contribution to Ubuntu.

 12:19 <FrozenZia> Did definitely *not* mean to create extra e-mail for everyone.

 12:20 <popey> It's fine, we don't get much email on that list :D

 12:21 <FrozenZia> popey: understandable about the measurable contribution.

 12:21 <popey> Typically we go through the wiki page and look at the contributions.

 12:21 <popey> Like translations in launchpad, forum posts, blog entries and so on.

 12:22 <FrozenZia> I could dig up some numbers of computers that are now "out in the wild" with Ubuntu installed due to my efforts, but it'd just be me "saying" that's how many are out there.

 12:22 <popey> Right, you understand our problem then :)

 12:22 <marcoceppi> FrozenZia: do you have any plans outside of a potential oggcamp talk and your current efforts with computers for the next 6 months in the Ubuntu universe?

 12:23 <FrozenZia> ...and as Walter said, due to this, you would be largely looking at testimonials, which I suspect I haven't actually managed to get very many of.

 12:24 <FrozenZia> marcoceppi: Definitely very interested in participating in translations.

 12:25 <marcoceppi> Any other questions for FrozenZia, FrozenZia any comments before going to a vote?

 12:25 <FrozenZia> A comment I sent to Walter earlier, and so I *think* you have all seen...

 12:25 <hggdh> FrozenZia: I would like to hear more about your plans

 12:27 <FrozenZia> hggdh: First the comment -- that I really am spending *so* much of my time in getting this business off the ground, and providing tech support for the machines we already have sold, that there's not a lot of time to do much else.

 12:28 <FrozenZia> hggdh: Hmmm -- not sure what to tell you --

 12:28 <FrozenZia> We've just moved our company out of a cellar and into a "real" premesis, so we've got LOTS more visibility,

 12:28 <hggdh> FrozenZia: that's OK. The thing that worries me is a mix of shown sustainable work on Ubuntu

 12:29 <hggdh> FrozenZia: We measure contributions to Ubuntu here...

 12:31 <FrozenZia> what with the current refugee stuff going on we're contacting refugee -facilities and trying to provide them with machines for refugees to use while there,...

 12:31 <hggdh> FrozenZia: I am personally inclined to suggest you wait a bit more while you collect data on your Ubuntu contributions

 12:31 <FrozenZia> At this point, it's the advocacy.

 12:32 <Kilos> FrozenZia imo you have the potential to be a great ubuntu member, you just need some more to add in contributions to ubuntu itself

 12:33 <Kilos> like translations are needed all the time

 12:33 <hggdh> FrozenZia: which we need to be able to check; if we cannot check, we cannot validate it to the point we accept your work in Ubuntu as *both* sustained and significant

 12:33 <FrozenZia> I have a few bug reports, comments on some, some forum input, but they're really nothing compared to the other work I've done.

 12:34 <FrozenZia> hggdh: Kilos: yep, disappointing, but understandable.

 12:48 <dupingping> I'm really professor for C and gtk3 programming.

 12:48 <popey> Is Ubuntu Dock based on some other software, or did you write it all yourself?

 12:48 <dupingping> of course, by myself. from scratch.

 12:48 <dupingping> I can show you the source fully to you.

 12:49 <dupingping> If i created it based on another softwares, i'll not created anyone.
