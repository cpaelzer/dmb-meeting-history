 16:07 <doko> xnox, that's an odd topic ...

 16:07 * pitti doesn't understand xnox's "doko" item, what did you do to thim??

 16:07 <xnox_> - bluefin christmas party later today

 16:08 <xnox_> doko: pitti: copy and paste error.

 16:08 * xnox_ is copying from keep.google.com and it doesn't do things right

 16:08 <sil2100> ;)

 16:08 * pitti pats good ol' plain text files

 16:08 <slangasek> pitti: "file RTs and requests for production readiness" - what does this last part mean?  what besides the firewall is a (known) blocker for putting s390x autopkgtest into production?

 16:08 <xnox_> and I'm on holiday 17th-3rd i believe too (holiday + closure)

 16:08 <xnox_> (done)

 16:08 <cyphermox> so high tech, I also just use plaintext

 16:09 <pitti> slangasek: I got two new emails now, could alreayd have been fixed now

 16:09 <cyphermox> (done)

 16:09 <pitti> slangasek: the firewall RT is actually not a blocker, just enhancement

 16:09 <slangasek> barry: are you still working on LP: #1522500 ?

 16:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1522500 in python-virtualenv (Ubuntu) "pip in Python 3.4 virtualenvs cannot install using a proxy " [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1522500

 16:09 <sil2100> chiluk: ? :)

 16:10 <pitti> slangasek: git isn't available for s390 yet, but I can work around that for now

 16:10 <barry> slangasek: not specifically, but as part of getting pip modernized

 16:10 <infinity> pitti: That's fixable.

 16:10 <slangasek> xnox_: ^^ should git->subversion bootstrapping be prioritized? (do you have time to do this without disrupting the image prep work?)

 16:10 <sil2100> Ok, I'll go on maybe

 16:10 <xnox_> slangasek: i can/should yes.

 16:11 <slangasek> ok

 16:11 <infinity> slangasek: All it needs is a subversion merge, I was going to do that.

 16:11 <infinity> Perhaps I'll do it during the meeting. :P

 16:11 <sil2100> - Landing team work, silo coordination, preparing landing e-mails

 16:11 <sil2100> - RTM Status meetings

 16:11 <sil2100> - CI Train:

 16:11 <sil2100> * Look into the ghost source-package name issues Simon had with his landing

 16:11 <sil2100> - system-image:

 16:11 <sil2100> * Testing bin/ scripts under the new testable framework

 16:11 <sil2100> * Write basic unit tests, start writing specific tests for tag-image, copy-image

 16:11 <sil2100> - OTA-8.5:

 16:11 <sil2100> * Review bugs and fixes

 16:11 <sil2100> * Prepare a hotfix silo with snapshot dep for unity8

 16:11 <sil2100> * Cherry-pick fixes to the snapshot PPA

 16:12 <sil2100> * Propose fix for installing older preinstalled clicks (camera-app revert)

 16:12 <sil2100> - Framework additions and changes

 16:12 <pitti> infinity: oh, is it? looked like the subversion build was blocking on ruby; but ruby and ruby-dev are installable on s390 xenial (I didn't test on -proposed though)

 16:12 <sil2100> - Landing Team tools:

 16:12 <sil2100> * Further improve the PPA state script to include archive changes

 16:12 <sil2100> * Work-around bug with unaccessible source publishing history for security PPA builds

 16:12 <sil2100> * Add generic script for archive package download

 16:12 <sil2100> * Improve image-promote for batch copies and latest-image checks

 16:12 <sil2100> (done)

 16:12 <infinity> pitti: No, it's a build-conflict in the old SVN that makes ruby-dev uninstallable.

 16:12 <tdaitx> merges (libjoda-time, superseeded by a new Debian version on Monday; freipmi; squid3)

 16:12 <tdaitx> openjdk bug triaging

 16:12 <pitti> infinity: ah, nice

 16:12 <caribou> Bugfix :

 16:12 <caribou> - rsyslog fails to start under upstart : Investigating

 16:13 <caribou> - Makedumpfile packaging

 16:13 <caribou> - sosreport packaging & CVE

 16:13 <caribou> â˜‘ Done

 16:13 <cyphermox> oh, I forgot to mention it, we had some issues with findutils yesterday, turns out the version from exp ftbfs and where it did not, broke some things (our d-i in this instance)

 16:14 <cyphermox> chiluk: ^

 16:14 <pitti> charles: right, it got pulled already

 16:14 <infinity> Obviously, the d-i thing is a bug that needs fixing anyway, we were using a deprecated option, but the FTBFS made things messy.

 16:14 <infinity> And yes, I deleted it.

 16:14 <pitti> charles: sorry, that was for cyphermox

 16:14 <cyphermox> infinity: the d-i thing is already fixed it

 16:14 <infinity> cyphermox: Lovely, thanks.

 16:14 <cyphermox> also I can't type.

 16:15 <infinity> That said, if deprecated options were dropped in this release, we probably need to be careful to look for fallout in the archive if we try the upgrade again.

 16:15 <infinity> findutils affects a LOT of stuff, both at build and runtime.

 16:15 <cyphermox> yep

 16:15 <infinity> (And, if we can avoid it, I'd rather not be ahead of Debian on this one)

 16:16 <slangasek> sil2100: "add generic script for archive package download" ... isn't that already 'apt-get download'?

 16:17 <cyphermox> or could it be to download all binaries built by one particular source package for an arch, in which case I can contribute a script I have

 16:18 <slangasek> ah, so non-stable findutils is turning out not to be a clean solution ;)

 16:18 <slangasek> * merges

 16:18 <slangasek> * discussion with mwhudson about the status of golang packages; preparing for a Debian merge and a new upstream point release

 16:18 <slangasek> * s390x everywhere

 16:18 <slangasek> * figuring out how to get the autopkgtest slaves online

 16:18 <slangasek> * SRU reviews for 14.04.4 HWE stack

 16:18 <slangasek> * discussions about LLVM versions for xenial

 16:18 <slangasek> * took care of archiving older 14.04 point releases for ppc64el off from cdimage.u.c to old-releases

 16:18 <slangasek> * assist with manual down-revving of click package for OTA8.5

 16:18 <slangasek> (done)

 16:18 <slangasek> (and sorry for the 5-minute gap while I was catching up with scrollback)

 16:18 <slangasek> any questions?

 16:19 <slangasek> tdaitx: did you have a merge awaiting sponsorship for libjoda-time or freeipmi?

 16:19 <caribou> Need information from cyphermox on LP: #1520192 (multipath-tools Trusty -> Precise SRU)

 16:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1520192 in multipath-tools (Ubuntu Precise) "multipath-tools from Precise should have been fixed together with Trusty fixes" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1520192

 16:19 <cyphermox> oh, that's new

 16:19 <tdaitx> slangasek, not yet

 16:19 <caribou> cyphermox: do you think that it is feasible ?

 16:19 <slangasek> tdaitx: ok

 16:20 <cyphermox> caribou: yes, provided tinoco or someone else can spend the time to carefully test things

 16:20 <caribou> cyphermox: well from what it looks, they've already tested it

 16:21 <tinoco> cyphermox: this same backport looks really good in openstack with vnx.

 16:21 <tinoco> actually is the only way of fixing openstack migration problems and path becoming active/faulty

 16:22 <tinoco> caribou: tks louis

 16:22 <cyphermox> tinoco: ok, let's just circle back and compare the test cases between your bug and mine to be sure we don't miss testing some non-obvious thing

 16:22 <slangasek> pitti, xnox_, infinity, tinoco: things look to be moving well this morning on the s390x front, based on what I see of my mailbox so far.  Is there anything you need my help to unblock you on?

 16:22 <tinoco> slangasek: i need 3 ips

 16:22 <pitti> slangasek: I'm fine; I'll set up production tomorrow morning, assuming that the instances are big enough now

 16:22 <tinoco> for DEVAC{01,02,03}

 16:23 <tinoco> so i can release them to foundations team definitely

 16:23 <slangasek> tinoco: ok, I'll figure that out this morning.  Do I give them to you, or should xnox_ take over the setup from here?

 16:23 <tinoco> slangasek: after IP xnox_ can review environment and let me know if he needs anything else.

 16:23 <tinoco> than i would add, just like pitti did

 16:23 <sil2100> slangasek: I never knew how to use apt-get download/source to download a specific version from the past, or from the selected PPA or from the selected series

 16:23 <pitti> slangasek: ah, cpu and RAM are fine now, disk is still too small, I'll follow up on the mail

 16:24 <tinoco> pitti: you have 2 MOD54 (~50GB) to be used

 16:24 <cyphermox> sil2100: did you alreday write a new script? want to see what I have?

 16:24 <tinoco> pitti: is this still small for you ?

 16:24 <xnox_> pitti: there should be a second disk with data.

 16:24 <sil2100> slangasek: if it's possible then I simply didn't know how, apt-get download/source package=version didn't really do much

 16:24 <sil2100> cyphermox: I have it

 16:24 <slangasek> pitti: requirements were 80GB of disk per instance, right?

 16:24 <tinoco> pitti: /dev/dasdb /dev/dasdc (to be used in LVM or the way you want)

 16:24 <pitti> tinoco: ah, do I need to mount something new?

 16:24 <sil2100> cyphermox: my lp:landing-team-tools has different strange scripts ;)

 16:24 <cyphermox> sil2100: to use apt-get download with package=version you'd need to have the release in sources.list

 16:24 <sil2100> cyphermox: yeah, and I just use LP API for that

 16:24 <sil2100> Without any mods needed

 16:24 <cyphermox> right

 16:25 <slangasek> sil2100: ah ok :)

 16:25 <tinoco> pitti: yep. disks are already there. you can use them ;)

 16:25 <sil2100> I could use chdist, but that's pointles and requires a lot of work

 16:25 <xnox_> slangasek: i guess it's the evalution of the pull-lp-binary

 16:25 <xnox_> sil2100: ^

 16:25 <pitti> tinoco: ah! cooll, thanks

 16:25 <slangasek> xnox_: right :)

 16:25 <tinoco> pitti: i sent you an email with details

 16:25 <xnox_> *evolution

 16:25 <cyphermox> sil2100: well, if ever it's useful: http://paste.ubuntu.com/13898161/

 16:25 <cyphermox> xnox_: pretty much yeah

 16:25 <sil2100> xnox_: well, yeah, for sources, do you have the same for binaries? ;)

 16:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:26 <sil2100> Anyway, it's a quick script, it's really trivial to do with LP API

 16:26 <slangasek> not cutting off discussion, just changing the topic, please continue :)

 16:26 <bdmurray> Does anybody have any ideas about bug 1495302?

 16:26 <ubottu> bug 1495302 in openssl (Ubuntu) "subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 10" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1495302

 16:27 <slangasek> exit status 10 points to a debconf issue, yes?

 16:27 <bdmurray> I think they may not be receiving the restart services dialog

 16:28 <slangasek> bdmurray: so, db_get should only ever fail if it's asking for the result of a question that's not found in the debconf database

 16:28 <cyphermox> could this be another instance of debconf prompts not showing because of interactive or whatnot, cf. bug LP: #1434547

 16:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1434547 in glibc (Ubuntu) "package libc6 2.21-0ubuntu1 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 128" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1434547

 16:29 <slangasek> bdmurray: I have the 'libraries/restart-without-asking' question on my system, but it's *not* shown as being owned by openssl

 16:29 <cyphermox> or maybe not

 16:29 <slangasek> Owners: libc6, libc6:amd64, libc6:armel, libc6:i386, libpam0g, libpam0g:amd64, libpam0g:i386

 16:29 <slangasek> which means openssl is asking for the answer to a debconf question, without itself making sure that question is available to debconf

 16:29 <sil2100> Ok guys, I need to AFK now for a short bit, we go to the vet (again) - this time with our cat ;)

 16:29 <sil2100> brb

 16:29 <slangasek> sil2100: heh, enjoy

 16:30 <pitti> sil2100: you forgot your cat the last time?

 16:30 <cyphermox> pitti: he goes *with*

 16:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: so normally the procedure would be for libssl to ship its own copy of this question.  If there's a reason not to do this, then libssl should instead declare a versioned dependency on the version of libc6 that provides the question

 16:30 <bdmurray> but he should have taken his cat the last time he went. ;-)
