 17:00 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 17:00 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 17:04 <jdstrand> sorry

 17:04 <jdstrand> this week I am working on an embargoed issue

 17:05 <jdstrand> I'm also finishing up the review tools upload that was postponed last week

 17:05 <jdstrand> tyhicks and I are going to hopefully finish up work planning

 17:06 <jdstrand> and if it doesn't get bumped again, I'll work on seccomp on upgrades on snappy

 17:06 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 17:06 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 17:06 <mdeslaur> I'm publishing strongswan as we speak

 17:06 <mdeslaur> I'm working on more embargoed issues this week

 17:06 <mdeslaur> and if I have time, I'll pick something else up from the CVE list

 17:06 <mdeslaur> that's it for me

 17:06 <mdeslaur> sbeattie, you're up

 17:07 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week.

 17:07 <sbeattie> I'm still hip deep in reviewing apparmor patches trying to get to a point to release 2.10

 17:08 <sbeattie> I need to push on getting the trusty apparmor SRU through, and will probably be preparing another SRU for bug 1460152

 17:08 <ubottu> bug 1460152 in Snappy "apparmor cache not updated when apparmor.d rules change (breaks 15.04/stable -> 15.04/edge updates)" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1460152

 17:08 <sbeattie> That'll probably consume most of my time this week

 17:08 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up.

 17:08 <tyhicks> sbeattie: what's the hold up on the trusty SRU?

 17:09 <tyhicks> testing?

 17:09 <sbeattie> yeah, verifying some of the bug reports

 17:09 <sbeattie> I need to report on the testing that I've done as well.

 17:09 <tyhicks> ok

 17:10 <tyhicks> I'm in the community role this week

 17:10 <tyhicks> my plans are:

 17:10 <tyhicks> ubuntu-core-launcher merge proposal reviews

 17:10 <tyhicks> return to the patch updates

 17:10 <tyhicks> add kernel keyring mediation support to !AppArmor parser

 17:10 <tyhicks> AppArmor patch review and revise one of my patches so we can wrap up the 2.10 release

 17:10 <tyhicks> embargoed items

 17:11 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 17:12 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 17:12 <jjohansen> finish up anything needed around bug 1460152, currently the patch is untested against the 2.9 code base.

 17:12 <jjohansen> prepare for the apparmor monthly meeting, well and a couple of other meetings this week

 17:12 <ubottu> bug 1460152 in Snappy "apparmor cache not updated when apparmor.d rules change (breaks 15.04/stable -> 15.04/edge updates)" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1460152

 17:12 <jjohansen> prepare for the apparmor monthly meeting, well and a couple of other meetings this week

 17:12 <jjohansen> I've got to finish up patch review around the latest dconf patches

 17:12 <jjohansen> finish getting together the pull requests for bug 1430546

 17:12 <ubottu> bug 1430546 in linux (Ubuntu) "apparmor kernel BUG kills firefox" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430546

 17:14 <jjohansen> hopefully get another round of review on the policy cache loading patchset

 17:14 <jjohansen> that would be for 2.10

 17:15 <jjohansen> and get back to upstream cleanup work

 17:15 <jjohansen> oh and the next round of kernels should hit this week, so the USNs around that

 17:16 <jjohansen> thats it for me sarnold, you're up

 17:16 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week, I'll return to focussing on openstack updates, and might do some apparmor patch reviews or sru testing for a change of scenery

 17:17 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson ?

 17:18 <chrisccoulson> I'll hopefully be testing chromium this week and getting that out

 17:18 <chrisccoulson> I've got a bunch of branches to review for Oxide too

 17:18 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I intend to get bug 1428754 finished (I landed a bunch of changes last week in preparation for this)

 17:19 <ubottu> bug 1428754 in Oxide "Persist permission request decisions for a session" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1428754

 17:19 <chrisccoulson> And then I'll be picking off more bugs from https://launchpad.net/oxide/+milestone/branch-1.9

 17:19 <chrisccoulson> That's me done

 17:20 <tyhicks> thanks
