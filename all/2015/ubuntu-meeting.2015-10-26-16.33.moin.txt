 16:35 <jdstrand> and some review tools updates

 16:35 <jdstrand> that's it for me

 16:35 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I just released mysql updates

 16:36 <mdeslaur> and I have an embargoed issue to test

 16:36 <mdeslaur> after that, I have some ntp updates to test properly and release

 16:36 <mdeslaur> and will go down the list after that

 16:36 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it

 16:36 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: , you're up

 16:38 <sbeattie> I have some yak shaving to finish up for xenial opening and to prep for the sprint

 16:39 <sbeattie> that's pretty much it for my week, though I'm hoping to pick up another update as well

 16:39 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're it

 16:39 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:39 <tyhicks> I need to do some sprint prep

 16:40 <tyhicks> I'm in the middle of the Mir attestable timestamps and mapplauncherd reviews

 16:40 <tyhicks> and still hoping to get to AppArmor kernel fix reviews

 16:40 <tyhicks> helping out with the update backlog would be good, too

 16:41 <jjohansen> I still working on the kernel patches for apparmor stacking

 16:41 <jjohansen> I will also have some sprint prep this week

 16:42 <jjohansen> thats it for me sarnold you're up

 16:43 <sarnold> I'm on community this week; there's a few xenial-open tasks held over fro mlast week, perhaps embargoed updates to work on, and a long list of apparmor kernel patches to review
