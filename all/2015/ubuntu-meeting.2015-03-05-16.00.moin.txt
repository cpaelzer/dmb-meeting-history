 16:12 <slangasek> oh

 16:12 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Lightning round

 16:12 <slangasek> stgraber:

 16:12 <stgraber> Short week, was off on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 16:12 <stgraber> - LXD

 16:12 <stgraber> - Released LXD 0.2

 16:13 <stgraber> 

 16:13 <stgraber> (done)

 16:13 <slangasek> thanks

 16:13 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:13 <barry> stgraber: did you look at the updated mp?

 16:13 <caribou> I have had a request for a MIR for openafs following a dkms breakage with the new Trusty kernel

 16:13 <stgraber> barry: haven't yet, no

 16:14 <barry> stgraber: k, no worries

 16:14 <caribou> the dkms build is not tested, hence a change in the dentry structure broke the openafs module rebuild

 16:15 <caribou> would such situation be better covered if openAFS would be included in main ?

 16:15 <slangasek> caribou: how does the package being in main or not relate to the dkms build not being tested?

 16:15 <slangasek> I think putting it in main is a rather heavyweight solution for addressing the package not being tested on kernel updates

 16:15 <caribou> slangasek: that's the question I have : having it in main would not give us better result on such cases

 16:16 <caribou> slangasek: especially since the src pkg build quite a chunk of packages.

 16:16 <slangasek> because main implies security review and security support, when all it seems you're asking for is to keep the package from regressing

 16:16 <caribou> apw did sponsor the upload for the SRU so I did talk to him about this

 16:16 <caribou> slangasek: indeed. Good then, that's the answer I was after, thanks

 16:16 <slangasek> caribou: so we now have autopkgtest support for SRUs

 16:17 <slangasek> it would be good to have a dkms build as an autopkgtest in the openafs package (and I would accept an SRU for this)

 16:17 <caribou> slangasek: ok, I will look into this

 16:17 <slangasek> then http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html would report the dkms failure ... er I think, unless the kernel packages are handled *too* specially on there

 16:18 <slangasek> bdmurray: ^^ would we get revdep autopkgtest results displayed for the kernel?

 16:18 <slangasek> oh, but the other problem is that openafs-modules-dkms doesn't actually depend on a kernel package, because that has side effects

 16:18 <caribou> slangasek: in that case, it would be the openafs-modules-dkms package that would fail, woudn't it ?

 16:19 <slangasek> so step 1) openafs should have an autopkgtest to prove the dkms module is buildable

 16:19 <apw> slangasek, i thought we had automatically implied autopkgtests for dkms things now

 16:19 <slangasek> apw: oh?  I don't know about this

 16:19 <apw> what we don't have is implied relationships between the dkms packages and the kernel

 16:19 <slangasek> caribou: yes, and the test failure of a reverse dependency is treated as a regression in the package that changed

 16:20 <caribou> slangasek: got it

 16:20 <slangasek> apw: ok, so is that somewhere in the CI team's backlog? :)

 16:21 <slangasek> caribou: anyway, hopefully that helps as far as identifying the "right answer"... there are probably still a few pieces to be put in place before it's fully implemented

 16:21 <sil2100> o/

 16:21 <apw> slangasek, that i do not know, i know we do have dkms testing, and we have been talking about using the results there to block the kernle via the britney blocks

 16:21 <sil2100> Sorry guys, my lunch shifted and it happened during the meeting

 16:21 <slangasek> sil2100: hey there :)

 16:21 <sil2100> I completely missed it... can I still put my status update?

 16:21 <sil2100> ;)

 16:22 <slangasek> apw: yes, exactly - though for SRUs we don't use britney so the blocks don't make a difference AFAIK

 16:22 <slangasek> apw: on the other hand, you could mark the linux SRU bugs 'verification-failed'...?

 16:22 <slangasek> apw: (with a bot)

 16:22 <slangasek> (and a pointer to the test results)

 16:22 <slangasek> sil2100: yes, go ahead

 16:22 <sil2100> Ok, a quick one then from my side:

 16:23 <sil2100> - Landing team work, silo coordination, preparing landing e-mails

 16:23 <sil2100> Never again late lunch

 16:23 <robru> sil2100: late lunch? or early dinner?

 16:24 <sil2100> hm, depends, since our lunch is usually the main meal

 16:24 <robru> interesting

 16:24 <sil2100> So we usually eat something more like supper in the evening

 16:25 <robru> sil2100: I didn't know there was a difference between dinner and supper ;-)

 16:25 <slangasek> the main meal is dinner; the evening meal is supper; the noon meal is lunch

 16:25 <slangasek> discuss

 16:25 <robru> T. I. L.

 16:25 <slangasek> or we could adjourn ;)

 16:26 <barry> i prefer brinner

 16:26 <sil2100> hah

 16:26 <caribou> brunch is good too :)

 16:26 <robru> I've often enjoyed a good breakfunch ;-)

 16:26 <sil2100> brlunner
