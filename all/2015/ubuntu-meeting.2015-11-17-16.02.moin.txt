 16:02 <rbasak> Sorry, I haven't done this yet. I'll carry it over.

 16:02 <rbasak> #topic Xenial Development

 16:03 <rbasak> It's mainly merge and sync time at the moment.

 16:03 <rbasak> I have a list of areas that need looking at. I'd like to assign some things to people.

 16:04 <hallyn> for instance?

 16:04 <rbasak> Let me list them.

 16:04 <rbasak> strongswan

 16:04 <rbasak> systemd-boot tagged bugs for server packages

 16:04 <rbasak> DPDK (I think cpaelzer and smb are working on this)

 16:05 <rbasak> etckeeper - we should drop the bzr delta now and resync with Debian, being careful to manage upgrade paths, and then stop worrying about this package.

 16:05 <rbasak> I'm working on MySQL upstream.

 16:05 <rbasak> NTP needs a merge and some bugs fixing

 16:05 <arges> i got libvirt

 16:05 <rbasak> freeipmi and logwatch need merges

 16:05 <rbasak> I'd like to look at deprecating mail-stack-delivery post-Xenial.

 16:06 <hallyn> etckeeper sounds scary.  though might be fun

 16:06 <rbasak> "Big" merges I think need doing are dovecot, nut, amavisd-new and bacula.

 16:06 <rbasak> That's my list.

 16:06 <cpaelzer> rbasak, I can confirm working on DPDK

 16:06 <rbasak> cpaelzer: how are you doing with nis? Do you want to take on one of the other merges as well?

 16:07 <rbasak> The deadline for all of this is feature freeze, which is scheduled for 18 Feb.

 16:07 <cpaelzer> rbasak, I havent found the time to do the nis fix for a proper transition on upgrade yet

 16:07 <cpaelzer> I hope to get it somewhen in November to a state ready for review

 16:08 <cpaelzer> rbasak, diving head on into dpdk I don't need an extra merge as of now

 16:08 <rbasak> hallyn: do you want etckeeper then?

 16:08 <hallyn> not right now.

 16:09 <hallyn> if you keep a list somewhere where ppl can grab items that'd be useful, but not sure how

 16:09 <rbasak> I know that nobody wants this stuff right now, but I'd like to have someone nominated for each thing with a non-immediate (Feb) deadline

 16:09 <hallyn> blueprint :)

 16:09 <rbasak> Yeah I should have a blueprint.

 16:09 <hallyn> thta i can do - put me down

 16:09 <rbasak> #action rbasak to create blueprint for Xenial feature work

 16:09 * meetingology rbasak to create blueprint for Xenial feature work

 16:09 <hallyn> (by feb :)

 16:09 <rbasak> OK. Thanks! Do you want a sooner goal hallyn for reminder purposes?

 16:09 <hallyn> yes

 16:10 <rbasak> End of Nov for now?

 16:10 <hallyn> yeah

 16:10 <rbasak> Thank you.

 16:10 <hallyn> (cause i' not around much indec)

 16:10 <rbasak> cpaelzer: can I do the same for you for a merge please?

 16:10 <rbasak> kickinz1: around? Can I give you a merge too please?

 16:11 <cpaelzer> rbasak, End of Nov is what I want to track myself as of now for nis

 16:11 <kickinz1> rbazak, yes

 16:12 * rbasak looks for something to give to kickinz1

 16:12 <hallyn> eh make it an action to find something :)

 16:13 <smoser> o.

 16:13 <rbasak> smoser: can I give you the systemd-boot issues maybe?

 16:14 <rbasak> Lovely.

 16:14 <rbasak> I searched for tag=systemd-boot, package/series subscriber=ubuntu-server.

 16:15 <rbasak> There are 10.

 16:15 <smoser> http://tinyurl.com/nzecls5

 16:15 <rbasak> Thanks

 16:16 <smoser> i'm sorry i joined late.

 16:16 <smoser> are you just asking me to triage ? or to commit to fixing .

 16:17 <rbasak> I'd like you to drive those for Xenial please. Fix as appropriate anything you deem important.

 16:17 <rbasak> If not important, feel free to triage to low importance and leave.

 16:17 <hallyn> delegate :)

 16:18 <rbasak> I'll find kickinz1 something after looking through the merge list later.
