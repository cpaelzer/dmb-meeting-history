 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:00 <jamespage> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:00 <jamespage> apparently none so that's good

 16:01 <jamespage> #topic wily development

 16:01 <jamespage> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WilyWerewolf/ReleaseSchedule

 16:01 <matsubara> o/

 16:01 <jamespage> apparently we're right ontop of feature definition freeze, which means we should all be working to get our blueprints into shape so that we know what 15.10 is going to mean in terms of new stuff

 16:02 <rharper> o/

 16:02 <jamespage> (28th May)

 16:02 <jamespage> I'm assuming everyone is familiar with the blueprint template?

 16:02 <jamespage> if not

 16:02 <jamespage> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BlueprintSpec

 16:02 <jamespage> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:02 <jamespage> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-w-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:03 <jamespage> hmm that appears to be empty

 16:03 <jamespage> are we expecting that report to work?

 16:03 * jamespage shrugs

 16:04 <arges> o//

 16:04 <jamespage> anyway - not reviewing blueprints today due to point in cycle

 16:04 <jamespage> hey arges!

 16:04 <arges> sorry i'm late

 16:04 <jamespage> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:04 <jamespage> no caribou today

 16:04 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:05 <jamespage> matsubara, you're up :)

 16:05 <matsubara> Some trusty smoke tests failed due to a disk space issue in the vm the tests run. It's in my todo list to take a look at that and get them going again

 16:05 <jamespage> we'll circle back to caribou

 16:05 <matsubara> other than that I have nothing else to report

 16:05 <matsubara> jamespage, ^

 16:05 <jamespage> any questions for matsubara ?

 16:06 <jamespage> nope ok - thanks matsubara

 16:06 <jamespage> caribou,

 16:06 <jamespage> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:06 <caribou> sorry for being late; network issues

 16:06 <caribou> nothing particular, aside from some squid-deb-proxy upstart changes that might impact maas

 16:07 <caribou> but kind of OT for this meeting

 16:07 <jamespage> fine

 16:07 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:07 <smb> Heya, I have one thing I wanted to mention:

 16:07 <smb> We have done a lot of hammering bcache with the 3.13 kernel and were

 16:07 <smb> unable to see any of those lockups/hangs we were hearing about. The

 16:07 <smb> only guess right now is that those hangs may be related to the use

 16:07 <smb> of NVMe drives as cache. And even that may require certain revisions

 16:07 <smb> of the HW / FW. So we cannot support the claim that bcache on a 3.13

 16:07 <smb> kernel has runtime issues. I anyone thinks there is one, please file

 16:07 <smb> bug reports with proper detail about used hardware, setup, and usage.

 16:07 <smb> That be all for today  :)

 16:07 * jamespage looks sheepish

 16:07 <jamespage> thanks smb

 16:08 <jamespage> good to know its getting some exercise

 16:08 <jamespage> I think we need to circle back to the lab where that issue was seen - later testing was done with HWE kernels

 16:08 <jamespage> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:09 <jamespage> anyone going anywhere good?

 16:09 <jamespage> OpenStack summit last week was well attended by Ubuntu folks....

 16:10 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 16:10 <jamespage> anyone have anything they want to raise?

 16:12 <jamespage> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:12 <jamespage> same time next week

 16:12 <jamespage> 2nd June 1600 UTC

 16:12 <jamespage> see you then

 16:12 <jamespage> #endmeeting
