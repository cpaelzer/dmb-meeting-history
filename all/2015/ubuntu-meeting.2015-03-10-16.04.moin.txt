 16:33 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:33 <smb> I don't have much. Just as a kind of reminder, there have been questions/reports about bcache which are (as far as I can tell) all waiting on feedback/info from someone who can reproduce things. I cannot do much before or without as I am not sure what to look for or how to reproduce.

 16:33 <arosales> smb:  I think jamespage has been looking at some bcache stuff, he is sprinting this week, but maybe able to get you some data soon-ish

 16:34 <smb> ack. thanks
