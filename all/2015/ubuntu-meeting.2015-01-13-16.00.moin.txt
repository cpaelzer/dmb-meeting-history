 16:06 <smoser> gnuoy, they'll need to get uploaded to vivid, yes.

 16:07 <jamespage> o/

 16:07 <jamespage> indeed I did

 16:07 <gnuoy> smoser, do you know if that's likely to happen soonish ?

 16:07 <jamespage> there is a bit of a focus on the switch to systemd this month

 16:07 <rharper> \o

 16:07 <smoser> probably should. :)

 16:07 <jamespage> gnuoy, that work is inflight with juju-core - we've asked it get backport to 1.22

 16:08 <gnuoy> ok

 16:08 <gnuoy> jamespage, and Bug #1388077 seems to be one of yours also

 16:10 * jamespage does bug housekeeping

 16:14 <jamespage> gnuoy, you might want to update the openstack charms blueprint (hint)

 16:14 <gnuoy> jamespage, with what in particular?

 16:14 <jamespage> gnuoy, any updates on work items

 16:14 <jamespage> right now have we done any charm work this cycle?

 16:14 <gnuoy> well, yes.

 16:14 <jamespage> 0/51 tasks completed

 16:15 <jamespage> :-)

 16:15 <gnuoy> I know, the blueprint haven't done an upstanding job of reflecting work to date

 16:16 <gnuoy> but I agree, updates to reflect reality would be good

 16:16 <gnuoy> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (not psivaa)

 16:17 <gnuoy> we should probably skip this until we have a rep

 16:17 <gnuoy> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:17 <smb> On our side we had talked about dkms modules and reviewing stuff with 3.19. For openvswitch I was wondering whether there still will be something with Vivid. I mean there isn't anything in the archive, yet. But I am not sure this is intentional or not. Though I think from the openstack use case the in-kernel module was good enough. jamespage what would you say? Also, just looking at testing it seems it is/was fail

 16:17 <smb> ing somehow for Utopic too. Which we may or may not care to care.

 16:18 <jamespage> smb, it was intentional - its really not required for >= 3.13

 16:18 <jamespage> I do have an in-tree ovs bug tho

 16:18 * jamespage looks

 16:18 <jamespage> bug 1408972

 16:18 <ubottu> bug 1408972 in linux (Ubuntu) "openvswitch: failed to flow_del (No such file or directory)" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1408972

 16:19 <smb> jamespage, Yeah I just got pinged by jsalisbury to help him review his dependencies

 16:19 <jamespage> smb, awesome

 16:19 <smb> Apart from that anybody has something he want to refresh my memory with

 16:20 <gnuoy> ... doesn't look like it
