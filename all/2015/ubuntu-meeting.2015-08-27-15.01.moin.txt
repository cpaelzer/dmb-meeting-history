 15:06 <robru> - submitted a few patches for packages failing with BOOST_JOIN, even got a couple accepted in debian

 15:06 <robru> - a few other small patches here and there, still lots to learn

 15:06 <robru> ✓ finito

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Learn the hard way how to backport stuff from OpenJDK 8 to 7 and 6, specially when ancestors have been selectively and partially backported

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Tried to use mercurial as a git user, not working; read on, got it somewhat right; felt like losing superpowers

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Tried to backport TLS 1.2 from JDK7 into 6, failed; a dev said he don't see a point; on hold for now

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Enabled TLS 1.2 by default for OpenJDK 7 and TLS 1.1 for OpenJDK 6; previously both used TLS 1.0 as default; LP: #1482924

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Learned more on the innards of OpenJDK packaging; also read security docs on it

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Built new packages for OpenJDK 7 and 6 with the TLS backports

 15:07 <tdaitx> Next steps

 15:07 <tdaitx> Waiting/On hold

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Figure out whether we have Oracle Contribution Agreement (OCA) or not; Dalibor from Oracle says we don't, doko says we should; need to get it if we don't have it

 15:07 <tdaitx> - Submit TLS backports upstream for review as soon as OCA is cleared

 15:07 <tdaitx> Updates

 15:07 <tdaitx> - ISP is in a sorry state, trying its hardest to keep me offline (and mad) since yesterday; maintenance is scheduled for the afternoon

 15:07 <tdaitx> (done)

 15:07 <bdmurray> created a set of core files for which the ExecutablePath could not be found to delete from swift

 15:08 <pitti> - enable autopkgtesting for precise: done for i386/amd64, in progress for arm/ppc

 15:08 <pitti> britney:

 15:08 <pitti> - britney: add linux→ DKMS triggering, to replace the old custom Jenkins jobs; also needs some dkms backporting for autopkgtest helper script (#1489045)

 15:09 <pitti> EOT

 15:09 <barry> robru: \o/

 15:09 <pitti> I suppose/hope infinity is asleep

 15:10 <robru> barry: :-D

 15:10 <slangasek> bdmurray: device blacklist?  there are rogue devices submitting broken crashes?

 15:11 <slangasek> pitti: what's our baseline for precise autopkgtests?  I don't remember this ever having been something we discussed doing, and I would assume the rate of false-positives would be unreasonably high

 15:11 <pitti> slangasek: almost no precise packages actually have a test

 15:12 <bdmurray> slangasek: yes, we occassionally see systems trying to report crashes that cause an OOPS when writing to the database and whoopsie tries to resubmit them every 2 hours

 15:12 <pitti> slangasek: this is mostly for kernel triggering DKMS, and some backported ones

 15:12 <slangasek> pitti: ah, ok

 15:12 <bdmurray> I haven't found the root cause and its just a couple of systems in the list so far

 15:12 <slangasek> bdmurray: wow, alright

 15:12 <pitti> slangasek: but indeed I expect a fair bit of "always failed" there; but we are looking for "regression", which will still be very useful

 15:14 <slangasek> right, I guess the situation would be /better/ than trusty since we don't have the situation of a pre-release baseline + 6 months of SRUs causing bitrot

 15:14 <pitti> slangasek: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/precise/update_excuses.html FTR

 15:14 <slangasek> any other questions on status? (and yes I assume infinity is off resting)

 15:14 <pitti> (still fairly new, thus lots of queued items still)

 15:14 <pitti> and DKMS package testing itself is fairly heuristic; we can/should iterate on that to refine it

 15:14 <slangasek> "lots of queued items" + "almost no packages have tests" == "hrm" :)

 15:16 <pitti> slangasek: we do have a fair bit of DKMS packages, and apparently firefox/thunderbird backports which declare Testsuite:

 15:16 <slangasek> ok

 15:16 <pitti> let's see how it works out

 15:17 <pitti> but CI and kernel teams want to move to this unified "let britney handle it" workflow instead of the custom jobs

 15:18 * slangasek nods

 15:19 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:19 <slangasek> Anything else today?

 15:19 <cyphermox> ah, yes

 15:19 <cyphermox> yesterday it was brought up that upgrading from vivid failed, with some modemmanager errors

 15:20 <bdmurray> pitti: Could you have a look at bug 1489410? I'm okay with working on it but don't know where to head.

 15:20 <ubottu> bug 1489410 in Canonical System Image "do not require apt lists to be pre-installed" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1489410

 15:20 <cyphermox> looks like it's more than just MM, it affects bluetooth too, etc. --> looks like an issue with dbus and/or systemd when upgrading

 15:20 <cyphermox> I was looking for a bug for it, will open one

 15:21 <bdmurray> cyphermox: bug 1481798?

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1481798 in modemmanager (Ubuntu) "package:modemmanager:1.4.10-1:subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 100" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1481798

 15:21 <pitti> bdmurray: will do; that's for testing the origin: only, right? as file -> package mapping should only require the dpkg db, nto apt

 15:21 <cyphermox> bdmurray: yup

 15:21 <bdmurray> pitti: right, ubuntu-bug wasn't working on the phone for packages from -updates because the lists for -updates weren't there.

 15:22 <cyphermox> bdmurray: I meant "if there was a bug with more info", but this works.

 15:23 <pitti> bdmurray: hmm, this is a rather poor bug report -- there is no description of an actual bug

 15:23 * pitti asks there

 15:23 <bdmurray> pitti: bug 1471903 has some more details

 15:23 <ubottu> bug 1471903 in live-build (Ubuntu) "-updates, -security missing from apt lists" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1471903

 15:24 <bdmurray> cyphermox: the duplicates should have more information

 15:25 <cyphermox> bdmurray: yes, they do

 15:27 <slangasek> alrighty, anything else?

 15:29 <slangasek> #endmeeting
