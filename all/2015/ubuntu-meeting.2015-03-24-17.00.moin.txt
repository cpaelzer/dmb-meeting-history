 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Review of sforshee upload rights

 17:02 <apw> sforshee, hi

 17:03 <sforshee> apw: hello

 17:03 <apw> could you introduce yourself, perhaps tell us a little about yourself

 17:03 <kamal> *cough*

 17:03 <apw> (for the record)

 17:03 <sforshee> I've been a member of the kernel team for 4 years now

 17:04 <sforshee> working on various and sundry things, including some packaging of kernels and related packages

 17:04 <sforshee> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SethForshee/PerPackageUploaderApplication

 17:04 <sforshee> I'm looking to get PPU rights to the linux-* packages to ease the work I've been doing

 17:05 <apw> i believe we have most of your sponsors here today, so if anyone wants to comment now is the time

 17:06 <apw> otherwise i think the majority of the approvers have works with you over the last few months

 17:07 <kamal> I stand by my sponsorship statment:  Seth is diligent and careful:  all good for linux-* ppu upload rights :-)

 17:07 <kamal> ..

 17:07 <ogasawara> I have not specifically sponsored a package of seth's but I've seen the work he's been doing (turning the crank on stable trees, handling linux-firmware, etc.).  He's being doing a great job..consistent, methodical, careful.  I'm +1.

 17:07 <ogasawara> ..

 17:08 <kamal> +1 from me

 17:08 <henrix> +1 from me too!

 17:08 <arges> From an SRU perspective, sforshee has generally shown attention to detail. The debdiffs I've reviewed have been free of cruft and look good. +1

 17:08 * smb would +1 as well despite being no sponsor either

 17:08 * apw has worked with him on a number of packages and feel he has the appropriate level of fear and self doubt: +1

 17:08 <bjf> +1

 17:08 <cking> +1

 17:09 * apw counts ... that appears to be +1 from all present approvers and a slew of additional approvals

 17:09 <apw> sforshee, welcome to the team

 17:09 <sforshee> thanks all!

 17:09 <cking> \o/

 17:09 <henrix> \o/

 17:09 <apw> thank you ...

 17:09 <kamal> \o/

 17:09 <ogasawara> congrats sforshee!

 17:09 <arges> good job

 17:09 <apw> jsalisbury, all yours ...

 17:09 <jsalisbury> apw, thanks.  and congrats to sforshee

 17:10 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Open Discussion or Questions? Raise your hand to be recognized (o/)

 17:10 <jsalisbury> Thanks everyone
