 20:03 <elacheche_anis> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Dec  3 20:03:27 2015 UTC.  The chair is elacheche_anis. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:03 <meetingology> 

 20:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 20:03 <jcastro> sorry I was in the wrong channel

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:15 <elacheche_anis> Next is fo0bar

 20:15 <elacheche_anis> #topic fo0bar

 20:15 <elacheche_anis> fo0bar, please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:16 <fo0bar> canned paste intro follows :)

 20:16 <fo0bar> Greetings!  I've been an Ubuntu user since the beginning (giving out Warty ShipIt CDs at the 2004 local LUG christmas party), and I've been an IS SRE (sysadmin) with Canonical since 2012, which involves a fair amount of interfacing with Ubuntu development teams, LoCos, community teams, archives/mirrors, etc.

 20:16 <fo0bar> I created and maintain the Raspberry Pi 2 Ubuntu 14.04 port, an unofficial community port of the latest LTS using the RPi2 kernel patchlist backported to trusty.  I've been a Debian Maintainer since 2007, and maintain a handful of packages.  On the Ubuntu side of this, I watch Launchpad, assist with bugs, and produce SRUs when needed.

 20:16 <fo0bar> Most of my Ubuntu strengths are related to package and distribution management.  I'm applying for Ubuntu membership primarily for the increased community collaboration opportunities, but also eventually possible per-package upload rights or even MOTU responsibilities.  Thank you!

 20:16 <fo0bar> Wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fo0bar - Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~fo0bar

 20:17 <elacheche_anis> Questions for fo0bar ? Supporters here?

 20:18 <jcastro> Debian contributions are always appreciated

 20:18 <Kilos> fo0bar what took you so long to apply

 20:18 <toddy> fo0bar: you are working at canonical? which position do you have? What are you doing there at most?

 20:19 <elacheche_anis> fo0bar: I want to ask qeustions, but can't.. As a SysAdmin, I know that you should contributed to every peice of the Ubuntu project bu now x) I love what you're doing.. Especially the RaspPi port..

 20:19 <fo0bar> Kilos: I actually touched on that a bit on the wiki page.  much of what I've needed to do in the Ubuntu community can really be done by anyone

 20:20 <fo0bar> and between that and the day job, well, supporting Ubuntu, I've been putting it off :)

 20:20 <fo0bar> joey and I talked about it awhile ago and he convinced me to put in

 20:20 <Kilos> im glad he did

 20:20 * joey supports fo0bar for membership.

 20:21 <fo0bar> toddy: I work in IS, so we maintain the hardware and networks, etc.  Canonical development teams and Ubuntu teams are effectively our customers

 20:21 <popey> well, I'd never heard of Turku before reading your wiki page fo0bar !

 20:21 * seelaman supports fo0bar as well

 20:21 <elacheche_anis> 2 supportes here :)

 20:21 <fo0bar> so it's a lot of network creation, deploying new services for customers, things like that

 20:21 <jcastro> yeah I feel like we all really missed an opportunity on telling everyone about turku

 20:22 <jcastro> I am ashamed at how awesome it is and I've never heard of it

 20:22 <fo0bar> jcastro: I actually made a post on insights.ubuntu.com a month or so ago

 20:22 <fo0bar> https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/08/04/introducing-turku-cloud-friendly-backups-for-your-infrastructure/

 20:22 * marcoceppi reads post

 20:22 <elacheche_anis> Yeah, I was surprised when I saw that on the wiki, am a SysAdmin and always googling backup solutions, 1st time to see that wsas this week in your wiki fo0bar

 20:22 <jcastro> yeah, I'd like to work with you on making that project more well known

 20:23 <popey> +1

 20:23 <popey> (to making it more well known) :D

 20:23 <elacheche_anis> Yep

 20:23 <elacheche_anis> Any other questions?

 20:23 <fo0bar> elacheche_anis: thanks.  and btw, thanks for the like on the rpi2 port (though I admit I've been slacking a bit with keeping the vanilla kernel patches integrated lately)

 20:24 <toddy> I have no more questions. I am ready to vote.

 20:24 <Kilos> ready

 20:24 * marcoceppi ready

 20:26 <elacheche_anis> #topic sturmflut

 20:26 <elacheche_anis> sturmflut, please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:26 <sturmflut> My name is Simon Raffeiner aka "Sturmflut". I'm 32 years old, live in Germany, have been using Ubuntu since 2005 and work for a supercomputing site run by the german government. My LP is https://launchpad.net/~sturmflut and my Wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Sturmflut .

 20:27 <sturmflut> I spend most of my "Ubuntu time" working on the Ubuntu Phone project, I'm an Ubuntu Phone Insider and an Ubuntu Pioneer and write blog articles about device and platform internals. I think I excel at technical things, but this year I've also started to make contributions for the overall Ubuntu Community by founding and organising the UbuContest and contributing to Ubucon Germany and Ubuntu Party in Paris.

 20:27 * popey added fo0bar to ~ubuntumembers

 20:27 <sturmflut> I'm on the team for UbuCon Europe 2016, but have also committed to support three other community events in 2016.

 20:27 <cm-t> Hi all and dear council! I can't stay online due to afk current needs. Just wanted to say I strongly recommnd sturmflut as an ubuntu member. He did and does a lot for ubucon (even for the ubucon Paris where he went to helped to bring it to the next level →  http://media.ubuntu-paris.org ) europe, and his ubucontest initiative is an awesome example to continue.

 20:28 <sturmflut> cm-t: Thank you very much :)

 20:28 <elacheche_anis> Thank you cm-t for mentionning that :)

 20:29 <cm-t> sturmflut: you're the guy

 20:29 <popey> Without my membership board hat on...

 20:29 <wxl> sturmflut: i'd like to see the ubucontest link get fixed :)

 20:29 <popey> I'm also here to support sturmflut, he's been super active in the Ubuntu Phone community

 20:30 <popey> Scheduling events, blogging, finding bugs...

 20:30 <popey> Uploading silly games, making silly t-shirts.

 20:30 <popey> We need more like sturmflut

 20:30 <sturmflut> wxl: the one on the Wiki? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuContest works for me

 20:30 <marcoceppi> Thank you for your work on Ubuntu Phone, also nice testimonials

 20:30 * popey puts his membership board hat back on.

 20:31 <wxl> sturmflut: yes but hthe one link there ttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuContest/UbuContest2016 doesn't go anywhere

 20:31 <popey> stupid wiki is taking ages to load

 20:31 <popey> fix it fo0bar ! :D

 20:31 <sturmflut> Oooooh

 20:31 <Kilos> hehe

 20:31 <marcoceppi> sturmflut: are you currently a member of a LoCo?

 20:31 <wxl> popey: that usually means the page doesn't exist XD

 20:31 <popey> True.

 20:32 <sturmflut> marcoceppi: No

 20:33 <fo0bar> popey: heh, but seriously, moin just doesn't scale well enough for the size of wiki.ubuntu.com, and it causes problems

 20:33 <wxl> btw fo0bar and Na3iL congrats.

 20:33 <fo0bar> I've just bounced apache, which usually helps

 20:33 <wxl> also fo0bar thank you SO MUCH for finnix.

 20:33 <Na3iL> thank you wxl & wb

 20:33 <wxl> moin stinks but that's another story :)

 20:34 <sturmflut> wxl: http://ubucon.de/2015/contest is the better resource in the meantime

 20:34 <elacheche_anis> Let's focus on the application guys :)

 20:34 <wxl> sturmflut: it really seems that all your evangelising would be greatly improved with the help of a loco

 20:34 <elacheche_anis> Any questions for sturmflut ? Or we are ready to vote?

 20:34 <Kilos> ready

 20:34 * marcoceppi is ready

 20:36 <wxl> sturmflut: you and toddy should talk for sure!
