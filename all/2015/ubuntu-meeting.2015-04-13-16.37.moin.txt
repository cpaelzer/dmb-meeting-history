 16:39 <tyhicks> jdstrand: I think you're busy right now so we're going to skip ahead to mdeslaur

 16:39 <mdeslaur> \o

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:39 <mdeslaur> and I have a half-day off on wednesay

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I just published some tasty and delicious ntp updates

 16:39 <mdeslaur> and I'm currently testing a bunch of libx11-related updates

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I have an embargoed issue to release tomorrow also

 16:40 <mdeslaur> and a few more things to work on after that

 16:40 <mdeslaur> that's about it, sbeattie, you're up

 16:40 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'm trying to review apparmor patches and pull things together for a trusty SRU and 2.9.2 release (to base the python utils in the SRU off of)

 16:42 <tyhicks> very nice

 16:42 <sbeattie> I've also again got gcc pie on my plate

 16:42 <sbeattie> that's the plan for this week. tyhicks?

 16:43 <tyhicks> sbeattie: all that is left for the gcc pie work is to benchmark a number of programs before the next dev release archive opens?

 16:44 <sbeattie> I still want to do a bit more test builds against it to look for build breakages.

 16:44 <sbeattie> (as well as the benchmarking, that is)

 16:45 <tyhicks> sbeattie: ok - those are two pretty important items so let me know if anything unexpected pops up this week

 16:45 <sbeattie> okay

 16:46 <tyhicks> sbeattie: we'll try to find someone else to handle any distractions :)

 16:46 <tyhicks> I'm handling the community role this week

 16:47 <tyhicks> my planned work looks quite a bit like last week

 16:47 <tyhicks> Vivid systemd/sbuild/schroot bugs (LP: #1427264) (LP: #1438942)

 16:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1427264 in click (Ubuntu) "using ecryptfs, creating frameworks fail to bind mount issues" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1427264

 16:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1438942 in schroot (Ubuntu) "Host's /dev/shm is mounted over when entering 14.10 and older sbuild schroots" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1438942

 16:47 <tyhicks> Restart work on AppArmor kernel keyring mediation for user data encryption

 16:47 <tyhicks> Send out the patches to fix bug #1430532

 16:47 <ubottu> bug 1430532 in AppArmor "libapparmor needs a public function to break a context into a label and mode" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430532

 16:47 <tyhicks> I worked on those ^ patches yesterday and I hope to send them out shortly

 16:48 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:48 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:48 <jdstrand> tyhicks: fyi, I can give an update

 16:48 <tyhicks> ok

 16:48 <tyhicks> jjohansen: hang on a sec

 16:49 <tyhicks> jdstrand: go ahead :)

 16:49 <jdstrand> I'm sprinting with the ubuntu core team this week

 16:49 <jdstrand> focusing on snappy, specifically seccomp and review tools

 16:49 <jdstrand> I think that is it from me

 16:50 <tyhicks> jdstrand: thanks! no need to stick around here - get back to the sprint :)

 16:50 <tyhicks> jjohansen: go ahead

 16:50 <jdstrand> hehe, thanks! :)

 16:51 <jjohansen> I'll be getting back to apparmor upstream cleanup again this week. I also have some stuff to do to get ready for the monthly apparmor meeting tomorrow, and an embargoed issue

 16:53 <jjohansen> that is it from me sarnold you're up

 16:53 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week; I'm working on the python-cryptography MIR; perhaps the conntrac MIR, perhaps the outstanding openstack update tests. I may also do some smallish apparmor patch reviews as focus/attention span permits

 16:54 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> I've got Oxide updates to do this week. I'll also be handling an embargoed issue

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> I'm going to spend some time getting Firefox on precise in shape, ready for the next release in a few weeks

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> other than that, I'll be working though Oxide bugs as usual

 16:56 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: have you had a chance to get FF building in precise yet? (I don't think you've had much time to work on it)

 16:56 <chrisccoulson> tyhicks, I've got it building fine, but without the hardening flags (hardening-wrapper doesn't work, as the new compiler is installed in /usr/lib/gcc-mozilla/bin/g++)

 16:57 <tyhicks> ah

 16:57 <tyhicks> sounds like nice progress :)

 16:57 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:57 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
