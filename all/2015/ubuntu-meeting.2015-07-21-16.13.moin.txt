 16:14 <kickinz1> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:14 <kickinz1> SO there was an action:

 16:14 <kickinz1> smoser to check with Odd_Bloke on status of high priority bug 1461242

 16:15 <kickinz1> But I'm unsure we can have some progress on it.

 16:15 <coreycb> kickinz1, I talked to Odd_Bloke and he's going to put some focus on it

 16:16 <kickinz1> Ok, I was pinging him. Thanks

 16:19 <kickinz1> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:19 <caribou> completed rsyslog merge, now needs a sponsor

 16:19 <caribou> aside from that I'm all good

 16:20 <kickinz1> Thanks caribou, you have some sponsor ideas?

 16:20 <caribou> kickinz1: I'll ping in #ubuntu-devel soon

 16:20 <kickinz1> OK

 16:21 <kickinz1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:21 <matsubara> kickinz1, hi, nothing new to report

 16:21 <kickinz1> Thanks matsubara

 16:21 <kickinz1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:21 <smb> Nothing to report but a topic that probably thinking about. Primarily this would affect libvirt (standalone or via virt-manager) which currently does not allow automatic NUMA placement.

 16:21 <smb> To have this support we would need numad but that is not yet in Debian nor in Ub

 16:21 <smb> untu (there is an ITP for Debian).

 16:21 <smb> So long term the question is whether we want this supported. Unlikely something

 16:21 <smb> that can or will be decided here in this meeting but maybe could be taken into c

 16:21 <smb> onsideration for future planning.

 16:21 <smb> If I understood the descriptions about numad correctly this would possibly not only be interesting for libvirt/qemu but also for any long running process that i

 16:21 <smb> s memory centric.

 16:22 <kickinz1> Thanks smb

 16:23 <kickinz1> Anything else?

 16:23 <smb> nope I am done

 16:23 <kickinz1> Thanks smb

 16:23 <kickinz1> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:24 <kickinz1> I think the call for ODS is closed since some days no? Any other call for papers still occuring?

 16:25 <kickinz1> There are Container.camp and IT Cloud Computing Conference call for papers still opened.

 16:26 <kickinz1> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:26 <kickinz1> There will be a sprint in August, maybe we have some news?

 16:28 <kickinz1> #topic Open Discussion

 16:28 <kickinz1> Anything to add?

 16:28 <kickinz1> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:30 <kickinz1> smoser will chair next meeting, same channel the 28th of July at 16:00 UTC

 16:30 <kickinz1> #endmeeting
