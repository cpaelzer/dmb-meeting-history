 16:12 <arosales> .

 16:12 <arosales> .

 16:12 <arosales> .

 16:12 <rharper> rbasak I wanted to chat about the bcache-tools sru

 16:13 <rbasak> Sure

 16:13 <rharper> what all do we need to bring that into trusty ?

 16:13 <rbasak> It will probably need a tech board exception. Technically the SRU team could choose to accept it I think, but historically they never do. So best to send to the TB in the first instance to save time IMHO.

 16:14 <rharper> right, ok

 16:14 <rbasak> Once that's done, a backport needs to be prepared and tested, sponsored and then the SRU team will be able to accept it in the usual way.

 16:14 <rharper> is there a general template, or do we fill out the SRU info in the bug and forward that ?

 16:14 <rharper> ok, I suggest we do some of the work in parallel

 16:14 <rharper> I know we've tested the vivid version in trusty

 16:14 <rharper> not clear about what's currently in wily

 16:14 <rbasak> We don't really have a template as it's pretty exceptional. An email to the tech board mailing list with a request and justification should do.

 16:14 <rharper> which I suppose is what we'd bring in? instead of vivid version ?

 16:15 <rharper> rbasak: ok

 16:15 <rbasak> We'd want to backport something that's already in the archive ideally.

 16:15 <rharper> ok

 16:15 <rbasak> If the Vivid version is tested and the Wily version is at increased risk of introducing regression (as opposed to fixing bugs that we want in the backport) then I don't see any reason why we can't backport the Vivid version.

 16:16 <rharper> sure

 16:16 <rharper> I'll have a look at the delta

 16:16 <rbasak> Thanks!
