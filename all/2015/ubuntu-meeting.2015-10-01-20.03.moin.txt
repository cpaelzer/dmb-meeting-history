 20:03 <elacheche_anis> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Oct  1 20:03:35 2015 UTC.  The chair is elacheche_anis. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:03 <meetingology> 

 20:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 20:03 <hikiko--> yes ready :)\

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:04 <elacheche_anis> #topic hikiko--

 20:04 <hikiko--> hello, I’m Eleni, I’m a software engineer @Canonical and I work on the desktop (nux, compiz and unity)

 20:05 <wxl> nice to meet you Eleni! :)

 20:05 <hikiko--> my wiki page is: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/hikiko

 20:05 <elacheche_anis> Welcome hikiko-- :) What can you tell us more about you ?

 20:06 <hikiko--> and my lp page: https://launchpad.net/~hikiko

 20:06 <hikiko--> hello all\

 20:06 <hikiko--> mmm what else

 20:06 <hikiko--> I like computer graphics

 20:06 <hikiko--> I m writing C++, opengl

 20:06 <Kilos> nice to meet you hikiko--

 20:06 <wxl> that seems apparent :)

 20:07 <wxl> outside of your contributions to the project as part of your job, how else have you been involved with the ubuntu community?

 20:08 <hikiko--> I write some blog posts related to Ubuntu (and that’s one of the reasons I’d like to become ubuntu member: add my blog to planet ubuntu so that more people can read it) and I participate to fosscoms etc

 20:08 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: I really LOVED that imgr link! But I can't find any other interesting information in your Wiki, like Testimonials from Community members, and community projects..

 20:09 <hikiko--> aren’t compiz, nux and unity community projects?!

 20:09 <wxl> absolutely, hikiko ! your contributions are apparent!

 20:09 <PabloRubianes> hikiko: any LoCo Work?

 20:10 <hikiko--> translations?

 20:10 <wxl> you do translations, too?

 20:10 <hikiko--> I’ve done 2 in the past (2005 or 2006) I’m not really participating on that sorry

 20:11 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: Yeah those are community projects, but your wiki should show that, it's like a resume or a summary for all that..

 20:11 <wxl> tell us about the last FOSSCon you were involved in

 20:11 <hikiko--> mmm I was hoping that people could find my contributions on launchpad

 20:12 <wxl> hikiko: like he said, it's like a resumé. not so much a list, but a little bit of detail.

 20:12 <wxl> although, as a programmer, i understand your logic XD

 20:12 <hikiko--> I’ve been to several of them and this year I m going to make a presentation on compiz and how people can contribute and write plugins from scratch

 20:12 <wxl> wow! at which one?

 20:12 <hikiko--> in our local fosscomm in greece

 20:13 <wxl> oh cool, i wasn't clear if you were still in greece or not

 20:13 <wxl> is there a large ubuntu community there?

 20:13 <Kilos> hikiko-- you should put all that in your wiki

 20:13 <Kilos> your wiki page is where you sell your slf

 20:13 <wxl> i think it's clear we need to better define what should be on the wiki

 20:13 <Kilos> self

 20:14 <hikiko--> well, it’s large compared to other oss communities but we don’t have large communities in greece :)

 20:14 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: I'm interested to get a video link to that presentation :) I'll be happy if oyu ping me after the FOSSCOMM :)

 20:14 <hikiko--> sure elacheche_anis :)

 20:14 <wxl> i agree with elacheche_anis, but i'd recommend also putting that on your wiki too

 20:15 <hikiko--> I will put it in my blog

 20:15 <PabloRubianes> hikiko: is there any reason you have no testimonials on your wiki?

 20:15 <wxl> anything you do to promote ubuntu should go there

 20:15 <PabloRubianes> maybe you didn't ask for them

 20:15 <hikiko--> I have other presentations too and tutorials

 20:15 <PabloRubianes> ?

 20:15 <hikiko--> well I asked people for testimonials

 20:15 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: I say it again & again, I really love and appreciate what you do for the community.. But you miss 2/4 from the application requirements → https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/NewMember#Preparing_your_Application

 20:15 <hikiko--> and some of them said they will write

 20:15 <hikiko--> but they didn’t so...

 20:16 <elacheche_anis> I feel you hikiko-- :)

 20:17 <hikiko--> ok robert_ancell will write one :D

 20:17 <hikiko--> thanks robert_ancell !!

 20:17 <robert_ancell> mkay

 20:17 <wxl> do you havea a lot of interactions with other ubuntu users/members/contributors outside of the ones you interact with for work?

 20:18 <hikiko--> mmm there are always people that ask for help in #ubuntu-desktop or #compiz or in lp

 20:18 <hikiko--> and we provide support

 20:19 <wxl> so you provide irc support, hikiko ?

 20:19 <hikiko--> but yes thats mostly work

 20:19 <wxl> is there a loco in greece?

 20:20 <hikiko--> I think so, there is #ubuntu-gr on freenode and some translating teams

 20:20 <wxl> yeah i think #ubuntu-gr is for irc support in greek

 20:21 <wxl> oh i'm wrong

 20:21 <wxl> that's their loco channel too :)

 20:21 <wxl> http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-gr/

 20:21 <wxl> have you tried to connect with them at all?

 20:21 <wxl> correct

 20:22 <wxl> that question from me was for you hikiko :)

 20:22 <hikiko--> well I know most of them

 20:22 <hikiko--> let me ask them to give some testimonials :p

 20:22 <Kilos> good idea

 20:22 <wxl> it looks like they're involved in the fosscomms too

 20:22 <elacheche_anis> Good idea hikiko-- :)

 20:22 <wxl> you should join the loco team!

 20:22 <wxl> it sounds like you're already working with them anyways!

 20:23 <PabloRubianes> LoCo teams usualy lack of strong tecnical people

 20:23 <wxl> absolutely!!!!

 20:23 <wxl> they desperately need them

 20:23 <elacheche_anis> So true.. You should try to get involved with them..

 20:23 <wxl> i can't read a word of greek but it seems like they're active

 20:23 <elacheche_anis> Are we good for vote, or there is more questions?

 20:24 <wxl> well it sounds like she's rounding up testimonials

 20:24 <Kilos> im in no hurry

 20:25 <wxl> oh wow they have ubuntu hours http://ubuntu-gr.org/story/30-06-15/ubuntu-hour-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B8%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF

 20:26 <wxl> ugh greek doesn't render into urls well apparently

 20:26 <hikiko--> in greece it’s 23:26

 20:26 <hikiko--> so there’s no much chance anyone replies

 20:27 <Kilos> aw

 20:30 <hikiko--> well, nobody replies :) I guess I can’t be an ubuntu member without testimonials right?

 20:31 <Kilos> sec hikiko--

 20:31 <Kilos> we will be with you soon

 20:31 <hikiko--> nooo\

 20:31 <elacheche_anis> Just a sec hikiko-- :)

 20:31 <Kilos> soory for the wait

 20:31 <hikiko--> I have one!!!

 20:31 <hikiko--> ok ok I wait but I have robert_ancell’s :D

 20:31 <elacheche_anis> Congrtas for that Testimonial hikiko-- :D

 20:32 <hikiko--> thanks again robert!!

 20:32 <robert_ancell> np

 20:35 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: we still here :) Just seconds and will come back x) sorry for that :)

 20:36 <hikiko--> no worries :)

 20:39 <popey> hello

 20:39 <popey> sorry, i was afk

 20:39 <elacheche_anis> #voters popey

 20:39 <meetingology> Current voters: Kilos PabloRubianes elacheche_anis popey wxl

 20:39 <Kilos> HI popey

 20:39 * popey catches up

 20:39 <popey> hi Kilos

 20:39 <hikiko--> hi popey

 20:41 <elacheche_anis> hikiko--: Work in progress :D

 20:41 <popey> I'd like to see a more comprehensive wiki page

 20:41 <hikiko--> no problem elacheche_anis

 20:41 <popey> we usually like to see more detail, and more testimonials typically

 20:42 <popey> loving your changes to nux/unity/compiz though :D

 20:42 <popey> I do wonder if maybe you're more likely to get membership via MOTU

 20:42 <popey> We usually direct developers that way.

 20:42 <hikiko--> what is the MOTU?

 20:42 <popey> You still get membership, but via a different route

 20:42 <popey> Masters Of The Universe

 20:43 <popey> Basically people who do predominantly development work

 20:43 <popey> as opposed to community outreach and advocacy

 20:43 <popey> Because there's a clear record of your development work

 20:43 <wxl> …the latter of which tends to be what we field

 20:43 <popey> So it should be a 'slam dunk' as they say in the USA :D

 20:44 <hikiko--> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU this motu?

 20:44 <popey> yes

 20:44 <popey> Check this out too. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard

 20:45 <popey> Does that seem more appropriate?

 20:45 <hikiko--> yes :) thanks popey

 20:46 <wxl> sorry for detaining you so long about this whole thing hikiko--

 20:46 <wxl> and thank you so much for all of your contributions!

 20:46 <popey> yeah, I'm terribly sorry for being late.

 20:46 <hikiko--> so, should I give up for the ubuntu membership and try to apply for the developer membership or it’s fine to apply for both?

 20:46 <Kilos> sorry hikiko-- keep up the good work and popin here now and again for a chat

 20:46 <popey> I'd go for developer membership

 20:46 <popey> it seems more appropriate

 20:46 <wxl> hikiko--: the dev board can approve you for ubuntu membership

 20:47 <Kilos> if you still want membership  here

 20:47 <elacheche_anis> If this can count as a good thing hikiko-- this is a 1st time we have all this discussion about 1 person that we realy want to approve but we can't becasue of rules..

 20:47 <popey> and they can review your work (better than any of us can) :D

 20:47 <Kilos> fix your wiki page

 20:47 <hikiko--> ok :) thank you

 20:47 <popey> Sorry for the confusion.

 20:47 <Kilos> add everything in it and reapply

 20:47 <popey> hikiko--: awesome.

 20:47 <hikiko--> no problem

 20:47 <popey> Super. Sorry for keeping you up late.

 20:48 <popey> Ok, any other topics to discuss?

 20:48 <Kilos> and hikiko-- hope to see you back here soon

 20:48 <wxl> i'm making a list of improvements from the previous discussion that i'll email out, so no popey. we can continue on there

 20:48 <hikiko--> sure Kilos thank you all :)

 20:48 <wxl> thank you so much hikiko-- !

 20:48 <elacheche_anis> OK, so just for the meetingology records, we are skipping votes becasue hikiko-- needs to apply for the Ubuntu Devel Membership

 20:48 <Kilos> :)

 20:49 <elacheche_anis> Keep the GREAT work hikiko--!

 20:50 <Kilos> hikiko-- look at other members wiki pages for some ideas on that is needed

 20:50 <elacheche_anis> Ping me when you apply for the Ubuntu Devel Membership, I'll be happy to say a HUGE CONGRATUALTIONS to you!

 20:50 <wxl> ditto hikiko--

 20:50 <Kilos> ditto elacheche_anis

 20:50 <wxl> i'd be more than happy to review your application

 20:50 <hikiko--> thank you guys I will apply soon!

 20:51 <PabloRubianes> cheers hikiko

 20:51 <Kilos> ty hikiko--

 20:51 <elacheche_anis> We probably should eng the meeting as there is no more applications for tonight!
