 19:56 <wxl> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 19:56 <willcooke> hi Kilos

 19:56 <wxl> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 19:56 <wxl> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 19:56 <Kilos> hi everyone

 19:56 <wxl> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 19:56 <wxl> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 19:57 <wxl> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 19:57 <wxl> #topic willcooke

 19:57 <wxl> willcooke:  please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 19:58 <toddy> hi everybody

 19:58 <Kilos> hgi toddy

 19:58 <Kilos> hi as well

 19:58 <willcooke> Hello board!  I've been using Ubuntu for about 10 years.  I started out supporting users on the forums and IRC, and then eventually managed to bad myself a job at Canonical.  I've done a few different jobs here but for the last year or so I've been managing the Ubuntu Desktop team.

 19:59 <willcooke> I'm a big supported of Open Source and Open Hardware.  In my spare time I like making electronic gizmos do things they weren't designed to do.

 19:59 <willcooke> LP: https://launchpad.net/~willcooke

 20:00 <willcooke> Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WillCooke

 20:00 <wxl> Excellent! Any questions for willcooke? ? Any supporters here?

 20:00 <elacheche_anis> Welcome willcooke :)

 20:00 <elacheche_anis> Actually I have a question

 20:00 <elacheche_anis> willcooke, I have no comments on you Wiki or LP :) I just love to know why you're applying for the Ubuntu Membership.. :)

 20:01 <Kilos> willcooke  why did you take so long to apply?

 20:02 <willcooke> heh, yeah, I kept meaning to apply, but I assumed that I hadn't really done enough to warrant it.  Most of my Canonical work was kinda behind the scenes

 20:02 <willcooke> but then when I joined the desktop team people were always telling me to get on with it

 20:02 <wxl> interesting. did you discuss that idea with anyone at all, willcooke ?

 20:03 <willcooke> so I finally did get round to it.

 20:03 <willcooke> So popey was quite clear that I should apply and he convinced me that I had actually done enough to warrant it

 20:03 <wxl> excellent

 20:03 <willcooke> plus rickspencer3

 20:03 <wxl> good job popey !

 20:04 <toddy> willcooke: do you involve in the loco in London?

 20:04 <hggdh> no questions from me. the testimonials are more than enough

 20:04 <Kilos> agreed

 20:04 <popey> the UK loco is mostly idle

 20:04 <willcooke> toddy, not really.  I dont get down to the office so much.

 20:05 <willcooke> we "organised" a release party for 15.04

 20:05 <willcooke> which was basically "let's go to the pub"

 20:05 <hggdh> organised enough, I would say
