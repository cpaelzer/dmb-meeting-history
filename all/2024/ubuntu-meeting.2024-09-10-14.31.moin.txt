 14:32 <jbicha> I'm working on gnome-snapshot, apologies for the impact on the report

 14:33 <slyon> sysprof is new. both both dependencies (libpanel, libdex) seem to be handled.

 14:33 <slyon> I moved bug #2066272 to "Fix Committed". But it still needs a team bug-subscriber CC jbicha

 14:33 <jbicha> there is a bug subscriber now

 14:33 <slyon> thx! Let's wait for some AA to promote it, then

 14:34 <slyon> bug #2066262

 14:34 <slyon> we have security ACK and MIR looks good, too. Now that we're on the latest version. Do you agree joalif? Could you move the bug to "Fix Committed" if you feel like your requirements where met?

 14:35 <joalif> sure"

 14:35 <slyon> dkms, -x11-utils, referencing and autopkgtest are still in progress.

 14:36 <slyon> and jbicha is working on the gnome-snapshot package, get rid of the big tree (I suppose we missed to vendor the rust-gst-plugin-gtk4 package, here)

 14:36 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 14:36 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:38 <sarnold> yay thanks

 14:39 <sarnold> sometimes I just don't feel like I *know* what github is trying to show me

 14:39 <slyon> hehe :) But it's all there. I'll get it addressed, but still waiting for more comments, to do it all at once.

 14:39 <sarnold> good plan

 14:39 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:39 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:40 <slyon> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:40 <slyon> sarnold: how's the velocitiy on the security review side of things?

 14:40 <sarnold> slyon: velocity has improved, we've distributed some of the packages to people, and asked for more volunteers before we select some folks to be voluntold

 14:41 <sarnold> it still won't be as fast as we like but there's movement afoot

 14:41 <slyon> that's good news, thanks for your efforts of getting more people involved

 14:42 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 14:42 <joalif> nothing from me

 14:42 <sarnold> none here

 14:42 <slyon> nothing from me either.

 14:43 <slyon> Alright, then. Let's wrap this early and try to get the in-flight MIRs/security-reviews done for this cycle. Also remember to comment on the GitHub PR.

 14:43 <slyon> Thanks all!

 14:43 <sarnold> thanks slyon, all :)
