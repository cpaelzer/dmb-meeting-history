 14:32 <didrocks> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:32 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:32:33 UTC.  The chair is didrocks.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:32 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:32 <sarnold> good morning

 14:32 <didrocks> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 14:32 <didrocks> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <didrocks> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:32 <didrocks> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:32 <didrocks> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <didrocks> it seems the only untracked one is dkms -> gcc-13. I don’t think we are going to miss it before release :)

 14:34 <didrocks> up to foundation, but with the holidays we don’t have representative, doko: this is probably on you and it seems just some AA work for gcc promotion (dkms -> gcc-13)

 14:34 <didrocks> #topic New MIRs

 14:34 <didrocks> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:34 <didrocks> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <didrocks> I’m moving back libdisplayinfo to NEW and reassigned to slyon once he is back

 14:36 <didrocks> and so, we have 3 of them being NEW

 14:36 <didrocks> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libimobiledevice-glue/+bug/2074086

 14:37 <didrocks> I am happy to take it, that will be one less on the list

 14:37 <didrocks> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-x13s-settings/+bug/2074078

 14:38 <didrocks> it seems an easy one. As I think everyone else is away, but I’m going to assume cpaelzer is happy to take this simple configuration package from the description :)

 14:39 <sarnold> :)

 14:39 <didrocks> otherwise, I will blame the MIR description report :p

 14:39 <didrocks> last one is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895

 14:40 <didrocks> unsure if the "TBD - create the MIR request" is actually cpaelzer not updating the comment to the description

 14:40 <didrocks> apart from the TBDSRC, the rest seems like a ready MIR

 14:40 <sarnold> mostly, there's still a 'TBDSRC' in there, heh

 14:40 <cpaelzer> thanks for running this didrocks

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I'm partially here now

 14:41 <cpaelzer> reading backlog

 14:41 <didrocks> cpaelzer: yw! I did a partial MIR assignement to you ;)

 14:41 <sarnold> '  x86-64 architecture, corresponding to x86-65 psABI v1." from the package description

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I'm happy to take the one you wanted to pass me

 14:42 <sarnold> "we've got 64 bits at home, why do you need 65 bits?"

 14:42 <didrocks> cpaelzer: already done!

 14:42 <cpaelzer> is that https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-x13s-settings/+bug/2074078 - yeah I see

 14:42 <cpaelzer> will you be able to take https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 as a trade?

 14:42 <didrocks> and so, on isa-support, let’s see next week if we can volounteer any victim to review it

 14:42 <didrocks> cpaelzer: I did take libimobiledevice-glue as the one for this week

 14:43 <cpaelzer> arrr

 14:43 <didrocks> depending on the bribing, I can trade! :)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> fine, 1 sec

 14:43 <cpaelzer> we nkow slyon is on debconf

 14:43 <didrocks> yep

 14:43 <cpaelzer> But joalif: jamespage: if you read this later and you have a bit of time, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 should be really trivial

 14:43 <cpaelzer> if it would not violate rules I'm tempted to self-approve :-)

 14:44 <cpaelzer> but there are reasons we have more than one set of eyes - maybe my assumptions are not right

 14:44 <didrocks> cpaelzer: more seriously if isa-support is urgent, I’m happy to take it instead of the other one which I think can wait for another week

 14:44 <cpaelzer> It is not more urgent than others

 14:44 <cpaelzer> it is more the (hopeful) triviality which makes me wonder if it should wait

 14:44 <cpaelzer> So I wanted to raise it with joalif and jamespage in case they see the ping later

 14:45 <jamespage> I've seen your ping

 14:45 <cpaelzer> didrocks: please feel free to go on here

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I wanted to ask, but not force anyone as of now.

 14:45 <didrocks> I just apt sourced it

 14:45 <didrocks> indeed, it’s easy

 14:45 <didrocks> I’m taking it too to unblock you

 14:45 <cpaelzer> thank you

 14:46 <didrocks> ok, let’s move on

 14:46 <didrocks> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:46 <cpaelzer> ack

 14:46 <didrocks> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:46 <didrocks> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <didrocks> ok, it seems jamespage spammed us :)

 14:47 <didrocks> to clear the proposed-migration map!

 14:47 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:48 <cpaelzer> that is fine

 14:48 <didrocks> the rest looks ok to me and there is nothing pending on us as far as I can see

 14:48 <cpaelzer> they also seem to be quick cases once openstack is convinced they are ready (=> New state) I do not expect much surprises

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ack

 14:48 <didrocks> correct, it seems that it won’t be the final rush on that side at least before FF

 14:48 <didrocks> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:48 <didrocks> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:49 <didrocks> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:49 <didrocks> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:49 <didrocks> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/61 is a valid question

 14:50 <cpaelzer> indeed

 14:50 <cpaelzer> let us just sync that we both would agree, brainstorm examples here

 14:50 <cpaelzer> if we do roughly agree, I can create a PR at some calm moment

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I can think of

 14:50 <cpaelzer> 1. Ubuntu compute center at location X

 14:51 <sarnold> "present in testflinger", "present in the taipei testing lab, talk with $name on $team, manager $name"

 14:51 <cpaelzer> 2. can be accessed at cloud provider foo via machine type bar

 14:51 <cpaelzer> ack to your list sarnold

 14:51 <didrocks> I think the confusion could be also that the "it" may refer to the package

 14:51 <sarnold> "engineering sample in $name's home on $team, manager $name"

 14:51 <didrocks> instead of the hardware

 14:51 <sarnold> good point

 14:52 <cpaelzer> indeed

 14:52 <cpaelzer> we can fix this in one go

 14:52 <cpaelzer> thank you both, let me make a PR once I find 10 minutes with that as the start

 14:52 <didrocks> but I agree too with the examples, that would be good illustrations and shows what the "it" refers too (probably 2 sentences)

 14:52 <didrocks> thanks cpaelzer!

 14:52 <cpaelzer> BTW I'm not too happy at the "home HW" maybe i should order them by "ok'ness' :-)

 14:53 <didrocks> heh :-)

 14:53 <sarnold> good idea

 14:53 <didrocks> another fun topic, security!

 14:53 <sarnold> "it is present on amazon"  :)

 14:53 <didrocks> ahah, with this referral code ofc :p

 14:53 <sarnold> lol

 14:53 <cpaelzer> lol

 14:53 <didrocks> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:53 <didrocks> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:53 <didrocks> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:54 <didrocks> Internal link

 14:54 <didrocks> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:54 <sarnold> alas no progress here :( it's been a very busy week so I've not pushed further on our resourcing issues :(

 14:54 <didrocks> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:54 <didrocks> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:54 <didrocks> (sorry, it seems my weechat client is really lagging in multi-lines)

 14:54 <sarnold> weechat is trying to keep you from being kicked off -- it might be a bit overzealous about it, but its heart is in the right place. there might be a setting for that :)

 14:55 <didrocks> sarnold: ack, I know the feeling here too :( as cpaelzer said, as long as it’s known by the chain management, this is what we can do

 14:55 <didrocks> sarnold: yeah, I will not blame it after more than 14 years of good services since I moved from irssi :p

 14:55 <sarnold> didrocks: certainly aburrage knows

 14:55 <sarnold> wow

 14:55 <sarnold> weechat still feels like a very new thing to me

 14:56 <didrocks> pitti sold me to it! (moved from bip + irssi to weechat)

 14:56 <didrocks> #topic Any other business?

 14:56 <sarnold> none here

 14:56 <didrocks> nothing for me either

 14:56 <cpaelzer> thank you didrocks for driving this while all are at the virtual sprint!

 14:56 <cpaelzer> nothing else from server

 14:57 <didrocks> cpaelzer: no pb! However, you won’t have any special not so random number suite today :p

 14:57 <didrocks> so, going classic…

 14:57 <didrocks> 5

 14:57 <didrocks> 4

 14:57 <didrocks> 3

 14:57 <didrocks> 2

 14:57 <didrocks> 1
