 15:32 <sarnold> good morning

 15:32 <cpaelzer> hrm, I created a stub for jemalloc

 15:32 <cpaelzer> why is that not shown ...

 15:33 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jemalloc/+bug/2088056

 15:33 <cpaelzer> anyway - assume server knows and will handle it

 15:33 <slyon> missing subsriber..

 15:33 <cpaelzer> right, it was too incomplete but otherwise it indeed doe not pull it

 15:33 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold

 15:34 <cpaelzer> I saw an agreement between desktop/foundations on architecture-propoerties

 15:34 <sarnold> not me, i'm barely awake :)

 15:34 <cpaelzer> which leaves two new blocks

 15:34 <cpaelzer> tell me if you handled them last time

 15:34 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes, architecture-properties only needs an AA for the promotion

 15:34 <cpaelzer> slyon: ok, I can deal with that tomorrow

 15:34 <slyon> thx

 15:35 <cpaelzer> There is python-osprofiler leading to a lot - has that been discussed?

 15:35 <jamespage> on my TODO list from last week

 15:35 <cpaelzer> it is ok to live there

 15:35 <cpaelzer> is highway also only waiting for an AA

 15:35 <cpaelzer> checkign ...

 15:35 <slyon> cpaelzer: not yet

 15:35 <sarnold> it's only useful if jpeg-xl also goes in

 15:36 <cpaelzer> waiting got xl

 15:36 <slyon> well, it's basically ready, but we need jpeg-xl first

 15:36 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:36 <cpaelzer> and scrolling to the right

 15:36 <cpaelzer> python-pint -> flexcache/flexparser

 15:36 <cpaelzer> jamespage: also on your list, or is this something else?

 15:36 <sarnold> iirc also jamespage, also known

 15:36 <jamespage> it is

 15:36 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:36 <cpaelzer> nothing really new we need to deal with then

 15:36 <cpaelzer> \o/

 15:37 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:37 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/node-undici/+bug/2080872

 15:37 <slyon> yeah... the http-parser replacement

 15:37 <slyon> I'd love some security team input on that one. Debian switched back to legacy/deprecated http-parser for now

 15:38 <slyon> But we should still come up with a decision, so we're prepared to drop http-parser sooner rather than later.

 15:39 <slyon> we could wait for some proper llhttp packaging to happen (there's now a Debian bug report about it), or use the vendored llhttp by libgit2 upstream for the time being

 15:39 <slyon> (if approved by security)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> so the proposal is using the vendored one until it available on its own?

 15:39 <slyon> yes, that would be my proposal

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I think we need to assign https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgit2/+bug/2080872 back to security unless sarnold wants to answer that right away

 15:40 <sarnold> good idea

 15:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: what do you think, able to answer right away or taking some time to do that right and assigning ubuntu-security?

 15:40 <sarnold> I'll answer now

 15:41 <cpaelzer> thank you

 15:41 <slyon> thx!

 15:41 <cpaelzer> do you do so on the bug or here (in which case we copy and paste it to the bug) :-)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> let us assume on the bug :-)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:42 <cpaelzer> the two flexes as part of pint as discussed before

 15:42 <cpaelzer> but a few more

 15:43 <cpaelzer> on bug 2058192 the creation of isolation features continues

 15:43 <cpaelzer> on bug 2015538 there is hope for a new tool, up to foundations to find time I guess slyon?

 15:44 <cpaelzer> bug 2054480 got an MP linked

 15:44 <cpaelzer> great, happy to see that coming

 15:44 <slyon> yeah... unclear who is driving the dbus-broker thing at the moment. Last it was the desktop team

 15:44 <cpaelzer> thanks waveform for working on this

 15:45 <cpaelzer> OK slyon, I was only assuming as it was your comment - but indeed it used to be desktop before

 15:45 <cpaelzer> didrocks isn't around or he could just poke for opinions internally, maybe jbicha ^^?

 15:45 <slyon> right, we discussed it during foundations triage, without specific action items, though

 15:46 <cpaelzer> bug 2087937 was fixed by downgrading the dependency

 15:46 <cpaelzer> bug 2071717 still is worked on by industrial people

 15:46 <cpaelzer> ok, all in incomplete is in better state than we could hope for

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:46 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:47 <cpaelzer> I've made about 10 minutes of progress on #70 but then reality caught up :-/

 15:47 <cpaelzer> nothing else that is new

 15:47 <cpaelzer> 70 = https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/70

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 15:47 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:47 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:48 <cpaelzer> we see the formerly mentioned jpeg-xl and a few ohers

 15:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I'm happy to see new faces as assigned

 15:48 <cpaelzer> is training more going well?

 15:49 <sarnold> alas, I'm the bottleneck there, I still need to make progress on pushing better documentation and tooling over the finish line

 15:49 <cpaelzer> :-)

 15:49 <sarnold> but i'm very happy to see enthusiasm and interest from folks

 15:49 <cpaelzer> \o/

 15:49 <cpaelzer> glad to hear that

 15:49 <sarnold> I just hope that we have easier cases than jpeg-xl and provd for first reviews :)

 15:49 <cpaelzer> AFAICS there is not much more in these queues today

 15:49 <cpaelzer> agreed

 15:49 <cpaelzer> jamespage: will provide some easy python libs soon

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:50 <sarnold> oh yeah, those are likely ideal :)

 15:50 <sarnold> I'm on PTO next week, I'll miss next week's meeting

 15:50 <jamespage> have a nice break :)

 15:50 <sarnold> and only a few days in the year after that

 15:50 <sarnold> thanks :D

 15:50 <cpaelzer> enjoy it sarnold

 15:50 <cpaelzer> I should have resolved my conflicts that have held me back the recent weeks

 15:50 <sarnold> (US federal holiday means many of your colleagues will be out some of the week)

 15:50 <cpaelzer> until end of year shutdown my availability here should be better

 15:51 <cpaelzer> indeed, thanks giving free infrastructure time to us in EMEA

 15:51 <sarnold> :D

 15:51 <cpaelzer> ok then party people, that seems to be it for today

 15:51 <cpaelzer> any last words?

 15:51 <sarnold> just so long as nobody breaks the holiday sales, hehe

 15:51 <cpaelzer> hehe

 15:52 <cpaelzer> famous last words - if you want a great random password, do not use "J%FV\E1,[@k!"

 15:52 <cpaelzer> bye

 15:52 <sarnold> lol

 15:52 <slyon> haha!

 15:52 <slyon> thanks all! o/

 15:52 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all

 15:52 <cpaelzer> there is no magic, came out of pwgen, but now it is in IRC logs messing up the AI overlords

 15:52 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
