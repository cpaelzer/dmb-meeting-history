 15:10 <juliank> OK one cat attack later, we can continue

 15:11 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:11 <juliank> It's a rather light load on excuses today

 15:11 <juliank> So we have time!

 15:11 <juliank> bug 2080499

 15:11 <juliank> bdrung: ^

 15:12 <bdrung> i tagged it. we should probably look at it since it happens a lot.

 15:13 <juliank> ok

 15:13 <juliank> tagged

 15:13 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:13 <juliank> oh I forgot the link for oo, didn't i

 15:14 <juliank> bug 1968613

 15:14 <bdrung> it is one of the top crashes on errors.ubuntu.com

 15:14 <juliank> The cache was closed while trying to access its objects ugh

 15:15 <juliank> tagged

 15:15 <juliank> bug 2080216

 15:17 <juliank> awkward

 15:17 <juliank> still sounds important to fix unfortunately

 15:17 <enr0n> I was confused about the claims that re-compiling things made a difference. My understanding is that the defaults here are controlled by net.ipv6.bindip6only

 15:18 <juliank> very confusing thing i nthere

 15:18 <enr0n> but yeah, when I wrote sshd-socket-generator, I made an oversimplification about the default listener addresses

 15:18 <juliank> But actionable

 15:18 <juliank> tagging

 15:18 <enr0n> ack

 15:19 <juliank> bug 2041518

 15:19 <juliank> This was for desktop, moving on

 15:20 <juliank> bug 2078720 I need to upload to oracular and noble too, but I don't want to have a ton of JIRA issues spawned from it

 15:20 <juliank> I guess it's fine though since only the apt tasks remain open

 15:21 <juliank> oracular needs fixes for 3.0 solver, and noble needs funny public key asseriton considerations

 15:22 <juliank> bug 2080233

 15:23 <enr0n> I probably could have just tagged this foundations-todo straight away

 15:23 <juliank> yes this seems straight forward

 15:23 <juliank> Sorry the cat sat down on the keyboard

 15:24 <enr0n> I'll tag etc/

 15:24 <juliank> bug 2078579 is one of those plenty of funny solverb bugs that needs more investigation

 15:25 <juliank> I'm inclined to let this sit a bit longer though to get some duplicates

 15:25 <juliank> No time to investigate yet anyway

 15:26 <juliank> jj and ff are empty

 15:27 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:27 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:27 <juliank> I think this is only waveform needing to sort out the ubiquity removal request?

 15:27 <waveform> or get it building ... but yes, it's with me

 15:27 <juliank> And that's it

 15:27 <juliank> #topic AOB

 15:29 <juliank> Final countdown

 15:29 <juliank> 3

 15:29 <juliank> 2

 15:29 <juliank> 1
