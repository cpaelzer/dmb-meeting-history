 16:03 <juliank> #topic Lightning rounds

 16:07 <juliank> I'm waiting for the cable modem to reboot

 16:09 <bdmurray> What is tmuxp?

 16:09 <bdmurray> powerful tmux?

 16:10 <waveform> python lib for the package

 16:10 <ginggs> bdmurray: something with flaky autopkgtests

 16:10 <ginggs> a session manager for tmuxp, apparently

 16:10 <dviererbe> :D

 16:10 <bdmurray> ginggs: that applies to a lot of packages. ;-)

 16:10 <waveform> ah, interesting

 16:11 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:11 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:11 <juliank> bug 2019026

 16:13 <enr0n> I mostly tagged this to see if people felt strongly enough that we should change the default. I took the stance of "if admin wants something different, just change the config", but I don't want to be an unnecessary blocker with my opinion

 16:13 <bdmurray> I'm +1 for auto cleaning and the way things used to be

 16:17 <vorlon> I mean, I think I made my position clear :)

 16:18 <juliank> I prefer the new behavior

 16:18 <juliank> Actually I prefer /tmp on tmpfs so I don't care

 16:18 <vorlon> cleaning only on boot, on systems with persistent /tmp, has some bad side effects

 16:18 <vorlon> juliank: yes so you don't get a vote ;D

 16:20 <waveform> I'd be quite happy to revert to the old behaviour

 16:21 <bdrung> /tmp is on tmpfs on my system, but cleaning it periodically will save memory

 16:22 <vorlon> that too!

 16:22 <Skia> same here, old behavior was good

 16:23 <juliank> tagged and targeted

 16:23 <juliank> bug 2054319

 16:25 <juliank> untagged and marked invalid, as we have 3-4 separate bugs

 16:26 <juliank> bug 2055175

 16:28 <vorlon> glibc

 16:28 <vorlon> I guess we need to take it

 16:28 <juliank> ack

 16:29 <schopin> I'm not sure I'll want to SRU this, though.

 16:29 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:29 <vorlon> it's only targeted to mantic and noble so I think that's fair

 16:29 <juliank> nobody runs mantic anyway

 16:29 <juliank> on s390x

 16:29 <juliank> nothing new on mm

 16:29 <vorlon> or even if they do they won't for long?

 16:30 <juliank> neither for jj or ff

 16:30 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:30 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:30 <juliank> vorlon: you wanna go?

 16:30 <juliank> I don't think there's really anything new in there though

 16:31 <schopin> there's a hint request opened for glibc to unblock the kernel (apparmor changes broke the test suite)

 16:31 <juliank> All the light grey stuff will be t64 and we should not assign them _yet_

 16:31 <vorlon> schopin: is the hint request acked by you?

 16:32 <vorlon> schopin: that had been my feedback: before we break the glibc testsuite we need agreement that this should be fixed on the glibc side

 16:32 <vorlon> juliank: so I think frankly it's not worth assigning anything this week

 16:32 <bdrung> initramfs-tools looks to be dep17 related

 16:32 <vorlon> everything is going to explode over the next few days in -proposed

 16:32 <schopin> vorlon: I haven't written it there yet but yes, I ACK.

 16:32 <juliank> ack

 16:32 <juliank> #topic AOB

 16:32 <vorlon> schopin: ok thanks.  happy to have you write something on the MP but I'll go ahead and merge now anyway

 16:33 <schopin> I was in the middle of this when the meeting started :P

 16:34 <adrien> off tomorrow

 16:34 <bdrung> autopkgtest/5.32ubuntu3 blocks the sbuild migration. Can someone have a look?

 16:34 <bdrung> (on s390x)

 16:37 <bdmurray> It passed?

 16:38 <Skia> looks like a timeout

 16:38 <bdmurray> I mean for it to be blocking it must have passed which is surprising

 16:38 <bdrung> https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/a/autopkgtest/noble/s390x is relative green

 16:39 <Skia> bdmurray: yes, it passed, I fixed it, remember?

 16:39 <bdmurray> apparently not! ;-)

 16:40 <Skia> there's a retry ongoing, I'll monitor it and see what can be done about it

 16:40 <bdrung> thanks Skia

 16:42 <juliank> #endmeeting
