 15:03 <juliank> I'm afraid I got lost in discussions and have no update written :(

 15:03 <schopin> juliank: same here.

 15:07 <ravikant_> o/

 15:07 <bdmurray> lost in discussions or in work?

 15:09 <vorlon> - preparing the design of t-shirts which read "I talked to Jia Tan"

 15:09 <vorlon> winning

 15:10 <bdmurray> Is the Milk-V Mars some new hardware we'll be supporting. xypron ?

 15:10 <adrien> I suck at design so only white letters on black t-shirt ;-)

 15:10 <xypron> bdmurray: nothing decided yet

 15:11 <xypron> It is a RISC-V board with the same SoC as the VisionFive2 which we support.

 15:12 <vorlon> adrien: that's fine, it goes right along with the "No I won't fix your laptop but mjg59 will" tshirt in my drawer

 15:12 <juliank> Does anyone want some more time for status update reading/discussion? We have 2 incoming bugs to discuss today

 15:13 <adrien> vorlon: :D   but now maybe I really need to make that t-shirt...

 15:13 <bdmurray> I'm still reading

 15:14 * juliank was in the wrong window

 15:14 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:14 <juliank> 2 today

 15:15 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:15 <juliank> bug 1951491

 15:16 <juliank> I think this is expected sort of?

 15:16 <juliank> People seem to try to run stuff as a different user in a cron job without having a user session for that user

 15:17 <juliank> Like this is not how you do this:

 15:17 <juliank> I had to install dbus-user-session and then make sure the /run/user/../bus was initialized by for example runuser -u user /bin/true.

 15:17 <juliank> And make sure that it remains by loginctl enable-linger user

 15:17 <juliank> But how is VNC related to it?

 15:18 <mkukri> that makes sense, but i am not sure if a user can reasonable figure that

 15:18 <juliank> I think there's probably 3 issues mixed into one at that point

 15:18 <juliank> Yeah some others somehow ended up with sessions without a session bus

 15:19 <juliank> Closing the entire thing and asking for clear bugs would be a good start?

 15:21 <vorlon> no objection

 15:22 <vorlon> next? :)

 15:22 <juliank> Since there was no opposition I've just done that, marking them all Incomplete and asking people to file clear succinct bugs

 15:22 <juliank> Writing took a while :)

 15:22 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <juliank> bug 2058743

 15:23 <juliank> sarnold:

 15:23 <juliank> sorry

 15:23 <juliank> slyon:

 15:23 <slyon> I wanted to reach out to the server team... Still need to do that

 15:23 <slyon> It's not urgent, we should skip it for now

 15:23 <juliank> ack

 15:23 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:23 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:23 <juliank> vorlon:

 15:23 <juliank> not sure anything useful there?

 15:24 <vorlon> mtd-utils missing builds? :)

 15:24 <juliank> yes but does it make sense assigning vs someone solving it in adhoc fashion

 15:24 <vorlon> I guess what I'll say here is, if anybody doesn't have a corner of the xz-utils migration to work on right now, this is a useful additional list to draw from

 15:25 <vorlon> but yes I don't think assigning individual packages here makes sense when we're in an all-hands-on-deck situation for xz-utils

 15:25 <juliank> Do we want to talk about xz-utils?

 15:25 <vorlon> does someone need us to?

 15:25 <vorlon> what has yet to be covered

 15:25 <juliank> otherwise it's aob

 15:26 <juliank> #topic AOB

 15:26 <juliank> So be it

 15:26 <vorlon> well, I can tell y'all what my plan is for my work day wrt xz-utils

 15:26 <vorlon> which is that by EOD I intend to have Ubuntu Desktop images buildable

 15:26 <vorlon> by hook or by crook

 15:26 <vorlon> so skiptesting anything necessary to get packages migrated

 15:27 <vorlon> stage 1 is still getting livecd-rootfs installable

 15:27 <vorlon> stage 2 is making debootstrap work

 15:27 <vorlon> stage 3 is making ubuntu-desktop installable

 15:27 <vorlon> help wanted to make sure we minimize regressing things in the process

 15:27 <vorlon> (similar to during time_t)

 15:33 <juliank> #endmeeting
