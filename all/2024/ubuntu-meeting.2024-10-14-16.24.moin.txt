 16:24 <rbasak> #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications

 16:24 <rbasak> #subtopic Agathe Porte

 16:24 <rbasak> gagath: welcome!

 16:25 <gagath> o/

 16:29 <rbasak> gagath: have you done any transitions yet?

 16:30 <gagath> rbasak: in debian, yes. in ubuntu, no.

 16:30 <rbasak> I'm finding it difficult to see the uploads that you've done that aren't kernel (since they're a different process) :-/

 16:30 <gagath> https://launchpad.net/~gagath/+uploaded-packages

 16:31 <gagath> I think all of them are on this page ^

 16:31 <schopin> Just for context, you have been part of the kernel uploader team since last May, right?

 16:32 <rbasak> The plymouth upload FTBFS in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/23.360.11-0ubuntu1. What happened there?

 16:32 <gagath> schopin: yes, this was https://wiki.ubuntu.com/gagath/KernelUploadRightsApplication

 16:34 <rbasak> The first SRU I looked at was bug 2069963 where the SRU verification didn't report the version tested.

 16:34 <bdrung> \o sorry, I took the day off and missed that we have the DMB meeting today

 16:34 <gagath> rbasak: for the upload ftbfs, the issue was dh_install: warning: Cannot find (any matches for) "/usr/usr/lib/systemd/system" (tried in ., debian/tmp)

 16:35 <rbasak> And the next is bug 2073688, where you seem to have flipped the SRU tags with no explanation?

 16:35 <rbasak> gagath: FTBFS> OK, but what went wrong in the process that resulted in you getting sponsorship for an upload that FTBFS? Why wasn't that caught earlier?

 16:37 <gagath> rbasak: I think the problem was that I and the mentor did not a proper build test of this. The mentor uploaded a 0ubuntu2 that fixed the issue after this was sponsored

 16:37 <gagath> my mistake was that I did not use a chroot and tested with a wrong version of pkg-config

 16:38 <gagath> that generated the double /usr

 16:38 <gagath> for the mentor I guess their mistake could be the same

 16:39 <gagath> for 2069963 I forgot to add the version tested in my SRU test message. I confirmed the version tested in a later comment on the bug.

 16:41 <schopin> gagath: you mentioned that you haven't done transitions in Ubuntu yet, but have in Debian. Can you speak of the differences between Debian and Ubuntu on the handling of transitions?

 16:41 <gagath> and for 2073688 I also forgot to explain what I did and with which version. I really need to focus on that. I performed the test according to the test plan but did not add some logs when changing the tags.

 16:42 <rbasak> We don't need logs as such FWIW. Just confirmation of what tests you performed and what version you tested, and the pass result.

 16:42 <gagath> ack

 16:42 <rbasak> Because we have other people who have flipped tags without testing anything because they think the tags need flipping and that's it.

 16:43 <gagath> I see what you are referring to.

 16:43 <rbasak> (and the tests performed need to match the agreed test plan of course)

 16:43 <rbasak> (IOW we believe what you say, but not if you don't say it :-)

 16:44 <gagath> schopin: in Debian I uploaded my packages that depended on each other to unstable, and when everything was in place britney was able to publish them all at once to unstable

 16:45 <gagath> for ubuntu, it would be the same mechanism but using -proposed if the transition is for a stable release

 16:46 <schopin> Not for devel?

 16:47 <gagath> for devel, you would push directly to the devel as there is no -proposed and -updates yet in place (like debian)

 16:47 <gagath> mhm, wiat

 16:48 <gagath> yes. like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mofed-modules-24.07/+bug/2080904

 16:48 <gagath> the upload was for oracular and the bug got closed directly without SRU involved.

 16:49 <gagath> (when oracular was devel)

 16:49 <rbasak> gagath: where is the handing of proposed migration documented in Ubuntu, and where would you go to find a list of outstanding blockers for a given package's pending migration?

 16:50 <gagath> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/ProposedMigration.md

 16:50 <gagath> blockers can be found here: https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html

 16:51 <gagath> there is a nicer page with a .fr domain name but I sometime struggle to find it and it is... unofficial

 16:51 <schopin> gagath: fwiw, that page is about devel-proposed, which is very much a thing!

 16:51 <gagath> oh

 16:52 <gagath> a

 16:52 <gagath> https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/

 16:53 <gagath> eg https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/noble/update_excuses.html for noble

 16:53 <rbasak> We're running low on time.

 16:53 <rbasak> Is everyone ready to vote?

 16:54 <schopin> I am.

 16:55 <rbasak> #vote Grant gagath core dev

 16:55 <meetingology> Please vote on: Grant gagath core dev

 16:55 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 16:55 <rbasak> -1

 16:55 <meetingology> -1 received from rbasak

 16:55 <rbasak> (reasons to follow)

 16:57 <bdrung> -1

 16:57 <meetingology> -1 received from bdrung

 16:57 <schopin> -1 While I don't doubt gagath's packaging skills, I feel there is a lack of understanding surrounding the Ubuntu processes at large, and in particular on the lifecycle of a package during the development cycle.

 16:57 <meetingology> -1 While I don't doubt gagath's packaging skills, I feel there is a lack of understanding surrounding the Ubuntu processes at large, and in particular on the lifecycle of a package during the development cycle. received from schopin

 16:57 <rbasak> teward: vote?

 16:59 <bdrung> the reason for my vote is the same as what schopin wrote.

 16:59 <schopin> gagath: fwiw, something that helped me a lot to familiar with devel was doing +1 shifts.

 16:59 <gagath> schopin: I wanted to do that, but could not dedicate a full week since the kernel team is already understaffed.

 17:00 <gagath> maybe I can ask again.

 17:00 <meetingology> Votes for: 0, Votes against: 3, Abstentions: 0

 17:00 <meetingology> Motion denied

 17:00 <rbasak> More information on my vote:

 17:00 <rbasak> Thank you for your contributions to Ubuntu! I especially value that you are a DD already.

 17:00 <rbasak> Unfortunately I think the Ubuntu-specific expectatiosn we have haven't really been demonstrated. These are important when you are uploading unsupervised, and in particular when others ask you to sponsor for them while under pressure.

 17:00 <rbasak> IMHO (other DMB members differ in opinion on this point), a straight to core dev application needs to be exceptionally strong, but so far, wherever I look, there's some issue. This might be made up by experience or an extensive track record, but I don't see that either in Ubuntu (excluding kernel uploads that have a completely separate process). I appreciate that you have extensive experience in

 17:00 <rbasak> Debian, but the challenge then is to ensure that you understand how Ubuntu differs in process, and know what Ubuntu-specific expectations we have. Unfortunately that cannot be demonstrated by your Debian experience.

 17:00 <rbasak> I have my personal expectations documented here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev

 17:00 <rbasak> I don't think your application really demonstrates meeting my expectations. I'd like to see good examples across the various topics in the penultimate paragraph. I'd also like to see endorsements commensurate with that.

 17:00 <rbasak> Thank you for working towards core dev, and please do continue! I'd love to see you getting this soon.

 17:01 <gagath> thanks for your time

 17:02 <rbasak> #topic Outstanding mailing list requests to assign

 17:02 <rbasak> cpete's application is still open for votes on the ML. Please vote! I need to do this too.

 17:03 <rbasak> #info cpete's application is still open for votes on the ML. Please vote!

 17:03 <rbasak> I don't see any other recent ML requests.

 17:03 <rbasak> #info No other recent ML requests.

 17:04 <rbasak> #topic Open TB bugs

 17:04 <rbasak> #info No open TB bugs

 17:04 <rbasak> #topic Select a chair for the next meeting

 17:04 <rbasak> Since there was no chair for this meeting I don't know where to start, so I'll start from after my slot

 17:04 <rbasak> That would be schopin, with tsimonq2 as backup.

 17:05 <rbasak> #info Next chair will be schopin with tsimonq2 as backup

 17:05 <rbasak> #topic AOB

 17:05 <rbasak> AOB?

 17:05 <schopin> Do we have a script somewhere for the chair to follow?

 17:05 <schopin> I didn't find it on the wiki.

 17:05 <bdrung> not that i am aware of

 17:07 <schopin> Beware that I might not be able to make it on the 11th as it is a holiday and I'm out of town. My presence hinges on the punctuality of the train company...

 17:08 <teward> rbasak: E:InternetLost

 17:08 <teward> stupid airport wifi

 17:09 <teward> rbasak: my vote was -1 for the same reasons you stated

 17:09 <rbasak> ack, thanks

 17:09 <teward> we can echo that on the ML but that's -4 which is quorate

 17:09 <rbasak> schopin: just the agenda.

 17:09 <schopin> Alright, fair enough.

 17:09 <teward> sorry about random disappearance btw can't do squat about airport wifi going bonkers

 17:09 <rbasak> #action rbasak to handle closing gagath's application

 17:09 * meetingology rbasak to handle closing gagath's application

 17:10 <rbasak> schopin: and you can see the commands by example. There aren't many!

 17:10 <rbasak> If there's no other AOB I'll end the meeting.

 17:10 <teward> rbasak: AOB is whether we're having a impromptu DMB meet during the Summit

 17:10 <teward> but i think you said that should be emaileid to devel-permissions

 17:10 <teward> at least if I read IRC backlogs right :)

 17:10 <rbasak> Someone did and I agree

 17:11 <rbasak> FTR, IMHO it's fine as long as it's quorate, reasonably public and inclusive.

 17:14 <rbasak> #endmeeting
