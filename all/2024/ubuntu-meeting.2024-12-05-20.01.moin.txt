 20:01 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 5 December 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:01 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:01:07 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:01 <Wild_Man> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 20:02 <andrew_46> Yes I have read and understand the whole document and I agree to be bound

 20:02 <Wild_Man> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:02 <Kilos> great

 20:02 <lucyllewy> üëçüèª

 20:03 <Wild_Man> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 20:03 <Wild_Man> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <Wild_Man> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:04 <Wild_Man> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:04 <Wild_Man> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:04 <Wild_Man> #topic andrew_46

 20:05 <Wild_Man> So, first up we have andrew_46, could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement, and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad account‚Ä¶

 20:06 <andrew_46> Hi! I am commonly known as andrew.46 and I am here to apply for Ubuntu Membership. A membership I allowed to lapse some years ago

 20:06 <andrew_46> I have a Discourse application here:

 20:06 <andrew_46> https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/andrew-strong-andrew-46-membership-application/49833

 20:06 <andrew_46> and a Launchpad page here:

 20:07 <andrew_46> https://launchpad.net/%7Eandrew-david-strong

 20:07 <andrew_46> I had a long history with the Ubuntu Forums where I wrote many guides and became a part of the Ubntu Community.

 20:08 <andrew_46> After some time away from that Community I returned to Ask Ubuntu where eventually I became a moderator

 20:08 <andrew_46> https://askubuntu.com/users/57576/andrew-46

 20:08 <andrew_46> And have worked there steadily for about 2 years

 20:09 <lucyllewy> lapsed..? üò± *insert Simpson's "that's a paddlin'" meme here (I'm being silly - really happy to see you reapply)

 20:09 <andrew_46> And my Forums id:

 20:09 <andrew_46> https://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=208550

 20:10 <andrew_46> Oops, more than 5 sentences :)

 20:10 <lucyllewy> :P

 20:10 <andrew_46> lucyllewy: Thanks

 20:11 <fenris> you may have more than 5 sentences :)

 20:11 <Kilos> we forgive

 20:12 <Wild_Man> That is because you have a long history andrew_46

 20:12 <andrew_46> It has been many years now

 20:12 <Kilos> yip, old member that went astray

 20:12 <lucyllewy> huff. honestly. can't sum up two decades of work in 5 sentences? what is the world coming to :P

 20:13 <Wild_Man> #voters Wild_Man Kilos Bashing-om lucyllewy fenris

 20:13 <meetingology> Current voters: Bashing-om, Kilos, Wild_Man, fenris, lucyllewy

 20:14 <fenris> @andrew_ : mind to share whats your coming plan on contributing ? are you plan to contribute with other projects ?

 20:15 <andrew_46> fenris: I have a deep suspicion with the current turbulence on Ask Ubuntu that my focus will be there for the next few years

 20:15 <andrew_46> Specifically the trouble with the owning company and the arrival of AI

 20:16 <andrew_46> But I am retired and will be available for other work when this has settled down

 20:17 <andrew_46> That may take a while :)

 20:17 <Bashing-om> andrew_46: http://www.andrews-corner.org/ubuntu/irssi.html - Is now updated to current ?

 20:17 <fenris> hoping that you have something that will help the community with the suspicion

 20:18 <andrew_46> Bashing-om: There should be a 404 on that one, I moved that one to the Ubuntu Forums I think a whle back?

 20:18 <lucyllewy> can confirm.- it goes to 404

 20:18 <Kilos> yip

 20:18 <Bashing-om> andrew_46: Good works :D

 20:19 <andrew_46> I think there is not much Ubuntu material on that web site any more

 20:21 <andrew_46> Some became outdated, some went to the Forums and some went to the Ubuntu Community Wiki

 20:22 <Bashing-om> andrew_46: Ubuntu Forums soon goes read only - any plans for your post maintenance ?

 20:23 <andrew_46> Bashing-om: I have been pretty inactive on the Forums for some time now. Certain of the guides that I wrote I can repurpose to Ask Ubuntu and some would be suitable for my web site

 20:23 <Wild_Man> andrew_46, anyone with old guides on the forum can move them to discourse and update them

 20:24 <andrew_46> Some might be better to sleep, read only

 20:24 <andrew_46> Wild_Man: That is something I had not considered yet

 20:24 <andrew_46> The Usenet and mutt material would be best left

 20:25 <Wild_Man> the forum goes read only the 12th of January if not sooner

 20:25 <andrew_46> Wild_Man: End of an era

 20:25 <andrew_46> and the beginning of a new one

 20:26 <andrew_46> There is a section on Discourse for such guides?

 20:26 <Bashing-om> End of era == Clean out the trash :P

 20:26 <mapreri> here!
