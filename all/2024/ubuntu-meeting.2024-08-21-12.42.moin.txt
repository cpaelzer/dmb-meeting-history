 12:42 <mapreri> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:42 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:42:43 UTC.  The chair is mapreri.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:42 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:43 <mapreri> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for <DATE>. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:43 <mapreri> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:43 <mapreri> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:43 <mapreri> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:43 <mapreri> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:43 <mapreri> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:43 <mapreri> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:43 <mapreri> #topic Nathan Teodosio  @nteodosio

 12:44 <mapreri> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nathan-teodosio-membership-application/46796

 12:44 <mapreri> nteodosio: feel free to give a short introduction of yourself

 12:45 <nteodosio> I'm at the desktop team for little more than two years, mainly maintaining Chromium but also participating on maintaince of the desktop snaps and deb desktop packages.

 12:47 <fenris> a part of contributing to the project codes, merging request , assigned bugs .. can we know what other contributions you has involve or participate?

 12:48 <nteodosio> Hmm you mean apart from contributing to maintenance work?

 12:48 <fenris> yeah

 12:49 <nteodosio> Nothing comes to mind, can you give me one example of what would fit your question? Documentation?

 12:50 <Bashing-om> nteodosio: Put another way: As an Canonical employee - what does acquiring Ubuntu Membership mean to you ?

 12:52 <nteodosio> Bashing-om, to me it means I'm a trusted member of the chain. That means that, e.g., if I were to leave Canonical I would still be a part of Ubuntu

 12:52 <nteodosio> Which also implies that my contributions to Ubuntu are not tied to that.

 12:53 <Bashing-om> nteodosio: Good point - thanks.

 12:53 <nteodosio> You are welcome.

 12:54 <mapreri> what are you thoughts about more ubuntu promotion amongst the masses?  You are part of the desktop team, so I suppose you want more "normal" users to use ubuntu (i.e., not necessarily developers or servers, etc).

 12:55 <nteodosio> Yes indeed, that's why I think it is important to keep supporting the GUI stuff even if they are "easy" CLI counterparts. I know that the latter is a bit scary, I remember when I was in that position too.

 12:56 <nteodosio> So for example I really like contributing to software-properties and update-manager even if they can be replaced by say editing /etc/apt/sources.list{,d/} or apt update; apt upgrade.

 12:57 <nteodosio> I'm not the one doing the promotion in the sense of "spreading it" outside of my personal circle but I belive that by keeping software good and intuitive that comes naturally.

 12:57 <mapreri> any interest in helping out your local community (if there is one)?

 12:57 <nteodosio> You mean geografically local?

 12:58 <fenris> i was about to ask the same

 12:58 <Kilos> ubuntu has loco teams all over,

 12:58 <fenris> are you joining any Ubuntu project group especially your LoCo?

 12:58 <mapreri> https://ubuntu.com/community/locos

 12:59 <Bashing-om> nteodosio: In some event that you and Canonical have a parting of ways - what means are at your disposal to continue Ubuntu contributions ?

 12:59 <nteodosio> I am not member of any such group until now, giving a quick look at it I would be happy to join. So far I normally hang around in #ubuntu and try to help when I can.

 13:00 <nteodosio> Bashing-om, as I don't have upload rights to any package, parting with Canonical would not alter my way of contributing, namely debdiff sponsoring or merge requests.

 13:00 <mapreri> alright

 13:00 <nteodosio> Only with regards to Chromium we'd need to adjust access I think.

 13:01 <mapreri> Let's call for votes!

 13:01 <nteodosio> As right now I have direct write access to it (I didn't have for the Bionic deb of course).

 13:01 <nteodosio> Ack.

 13:01 <mapreri> #vote Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio

 13:01 <meetingology> Please vote on: Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio

 13:01 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 13:01 <Bashing-om> +1

 13:01 <meetingology> +1 received from Bashing-om

 13:02 <Kilos> +1

 13:03 <mapreri> mh

 13:05 <mapreri> 0 - you have clearly contributed for quite a while, and my perception is that you might indeed want to approach "the community side" a bit more.  0 mostly because it feels you are a bit lost on what the community actually is, but not -1 as you do have plenty of (code) contributions -taking the time to also send them to debian, etc.

 13:05 <mapreri> well, this is it!

 13:06 <mapreri> Congratulations to all the new members. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/ (1/2)

 13:06 <mapreri> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them! (2/2)

 13:06 <mapreri> Bashing-om: could I leave the post-meeting stuff (including adding him to the LP team) to you?

 13:06 <Kilos> nteodosio  congrats , welcome aboard

 13:06 <nteodosio> Thank you all!

 13:07 <seb128> nteodosio, congrats! :-)

 13:07 <nteodosio> Thanks seb128! (:

 13:07 <mapreri> nteodosio: congrants indeed!  As somebody told me in the past: the membership is a form of recognition and a bit of a starting point.  You are a recognized contributor, in a way that ought to be more reason to keep contributing! :)

 13:08 <nteodosio> Thank you mapreri, and also for the hint on the Loco teams!
