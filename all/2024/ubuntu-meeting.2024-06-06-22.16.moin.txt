 22:16 <mapreri> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 22:16 <meetingology> Meeting started at 22:16:32 UTC.  The chair is mapreri.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 22:16 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 22:16 <mapreri> #voters Kilos Bashing-om mapreri

 22:16 <meetingology> Current voters: Bashing-om, Kilos, mapreri

 22:16 <mapreri> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for June 7th 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:17 <mapreri> Today we only have one applicant, whom is here already, and we also have a quorum, so I see no reason as to why we shouldn't be able to handle it today!

 22:17 <mapreri> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:17 <mapreri> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:17 <mapreri> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 22:17 <mapreri> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 22:17 <mapreri> #topic Bright Adams < Mrbite >

 22:18 <mapreri> Mrbite: please introduce yourself and share your links to IRC as well.

 22:20 <mapreri> Mrbite: ?

 22:22 <Mrbite> My name is Bright Adams. Am a blockchain Developer and am here to express my interest for Ubuntu membership.

 22:22 <Mrbite> Will drop links sooner.

 22:23 <Mrbite> https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/ubuntu-ng/155

 22:23 <Mrbite> This link directs you to some of our accomplishemts.

 22:24 <Mrbite> https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/bright-adams-membership-application/44254

 22:25 <mapreri> could I ask you why on discourse you are part of the ubuntu-unity-devs team, whereas I can't find any sort of connection anywhere else (especially in lpâ€¦)?

 22:27 <mapreri> also, could you confirm to us that indeed your first contribution to the community was roughly one year ago?

 22:27 <Mrbite> I really can't say how I got that tag.

 22:28 <Mrbite> Yes, roughly a year ago.

 22:28 <mapreri> ack.

 22:29 <mapreri> On discourse, you state "I am eager to continue my contributions to the Ubuntu community and to work towards its goals" - could you possibly be a bit more specific about what you'd like to engage in?

 22:30 <Bashing-om> I count 10 months contributing - with huge efforts.

 22:32 <Mrbite> Continue to contribute to the Ubuntu Comm. and further its growth.

 22:33 <Bashing-om> Mrbite: What does attaining Ubuntu membership mean to you, personally ?

 22:35 <Mrbite> Getting Ubuntu membership means a lot to me

 22:35 <Mrbite> It feels like I'm part of something bigger and important. ...Plus, it pushes me to keep learning and doing more.

 22:36 <Bashing-om> :)

 22:36 <Kilos> Mrbite: have you been to your discourse pages again ?

 22:36 <Mrbite> Not yet

 22:36 <Kilos> there are links to other countries in africa that also use ubuntu

 22:37 <Kilos> I think I collected them all in 2016 or soon after

 22:37 <Mrbite> Ye i saw the link Bashing-om sent.

 22:38 <Mrbite> Okay thats great, what do you suggest I do wit them?

 22:38 <Kilos> please follow up on them

 22:38 <Mrbite> Why are they not on the discourse?

 22:39 <Kilos> encourage them , when freenode crashed many of them left irc

 22:39 <Kilos> discourse is newish

 22:39 <Kilos> we used launchpad and the wiki before

 22:40 <Mrbite> Ohhh Thats right.

 22:40 <Mrbite> Will do just that.

 22:40 <Kilos> thank you

 22:42 <mapreri> I likewise encourage you to look a bit into a bit of "history" of the project, as there have been changes over the years (and there are still changes ongoing, like how IRC is slowly being replaced by matrix).  but a community as wide as Ubuntu's can be slow to move and adapt. :)

 22:42 <mapreri> You'll easily find pieces left over from our predecessors and have been abandoned here and there... (not necessarily what you need, but some finds can be pretty interesting and amusing heh)

 22:43 <Mrbite> Ye... thats right.

 22:43 <mapreri> Kilos, Bashing-om: would you be ready to vote?

 22:43 <Mrbite> Will look into that.

 22:43 <mapreri> or would you like more time?

 22:43 <Kilos> mapreri: yip

 22:43 <Bashing-om> yup

 22:43 <Bashing-om> ready to vote.

 22:44 <mapreri> #vote Ubuntu Membership for Mrbite

 22:44 <meetingology> Please vote on: Ubuntu Membership for Mrbite

 22:44 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 22:44 <Bashing-om> +1

 22:44 <meetingology> +1 received from Bashing-om

 22:44 <Kilos> +1

 22:44 <meetingology> +1 received from Kilos

 22:44 <Kilos> and a +1 from wildman

 22:45 <mapreri> +1 - what you have done in this little time is honestly quite amazing, going from next to nothing to such nice meetups!  However for me normally I'd consider contributions in such short timeframe not quite enough.  I pretty much giving this +1 in the hope that you'll continue strong in spreading Ubuntu around Nigeria, and Africa as a whole! :)
