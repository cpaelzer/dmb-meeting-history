 15:29 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:29 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:29:54 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:29 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:29 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 15:30 <cpaelzer> I know I'm early, but wanted to get the ping out in time

 15:30 <slyon> o/

 15:30 <eslerm> hello o/

 15:30 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:30 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:30 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:30 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:31 <cpaelzer> wow

 15:31 <cpaelzer> the new nvidia driver is wanted a lot

 15:31 <cpaelzer> I'm not in the mood to count the lines

 15:31 <cpaelzer> but those are normal, no new MIR needed and the team handles them well

 15:31 <cpaelzer> no action needed

 15:31 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-cssselect/+bug/2048760 is open

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I guess we will see that later as it seems ready for review

 15:32 <slyon> yes

 15:32 <joalif> o/

 15:32 <eslerm> (just curious, how would I run mismatch on an arbitrary universe package to see its MIR requirements)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> dkim-perl is known and still worked on by mirespace

 15:32 <sarnold> good morning

 15:33 <cpaelzer> eslerm: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir?tab=readme-ov-file#tools

 15:33 <eslerm> thanks!

 15:33 <cpaelzer> IIRC I wrote my own as it wasn't doing recursive needs

 15:33 <cpaelzer> not sure anymore, it was long long ago

 15:33 <cpaelzer> it is the right start

 15:33 <cpaelzer> the rest in mismatches is also known

 15:33 <cpaelzer> python-infelct

 15:34 <cpaelzer> the same cssselect

 15:34 <cpaelzer> and known logcheck->esmtp

 15:34 <cpaelzer> going on in the agenda ...

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:34 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:34 <cpaelzer> as assumed

 15:34 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-cssselect/+bug/2048760

 15:34 <cpaelzer> and also

 15:34 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libnet-idn-encode-perl/+bug/2038929

 15:34 <cpaelzer> let me read the discussion ont he latter

 15:35 <slyon> I assume the latter could be WONTFIX, as mirespace changed the reverse-dependency, so that it is no longer needed

 15:35 <cpaelzer> yeah that is how I read the comments too

 15:36 <cpaelzer> The former looks for a reviewer

 15:36 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-cssselect/+bug/2048760

 15:37 <cpaelzer> we have slyon and me and it is slyon's case ... avoiding self-review I think I have to take this one

 15:37 <cpaelzer> While I have more sprint things to prep that should squeeze in well (hope dies last)

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:38 <slyon> The MIR templated used here ^ is a bit outdated. mkukri is willing to update it if needed. But overall the package seems to be in good shape, so we should be fine reviewing as-is, IMO

 15:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:38 <slyon> cpaelzer: joalif was also waving above

 15:38 <cpaelzer> oh, blind me

 15:38 <cpaelzer> indeed

 15:38 <joalif> I was about to write the same :p

 15:38 * cpaelzer opens eyes

 15:38 <joalif> I can take one

 15:38 <cpaelzer> I've seen the security folks and slyon - sorry joalif

 15:38 <joalif> no worries

 15:38 <slyon> squeezing it in between a sprint, might not be the best idea

 15:38 <joalif> i was abit late to the party

 15:39 <cpaelzer> passed cssselect to you then joalif

 15:39 <joalif> ok

 15:39 <slyon> thx joalif!

 15:39 <cpaelzer> I'll need to thank you in my sprint presentation somehow now ...

 15:39 <sarnold> :)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> comments on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538

 15:40 <mkukri> i unfortunately didnt have time to impove python3-cssselect today, but will have it done by next week

 15:40 <cpaelzer> That is a Debian maintainer and upstream systemd contributor offering to help

 15:40 <eslerm> I asked SEG and there wasn't extra capacity to take dbus-brokers wrapper

 15:40 <cpaelzer> But it will still be O-release

 15:40 <slyon> mkukri: please coordinate with joalif about that (maybe it's not needed)

 15:40 <cpaelzer> eslerm: interesting, what was the answer?

 15:41 <cpaelzer> it is kind of a very soon or in 24.10 atm right?

 15:41 <eslerm> it was a favor request, they mentioned that they were tight on people but someone *might* be interested to take it on

 15:41 <eslerm> adding the wrapper likely needs to go on a roadmap

 15:41 <sarnold> yeah, and it's a large enough change that even if it were done today, I think there'd be serious questions about switching to it now

 15:42 <cpaelzer> by not finding time we are also becoming one of the few that have not yet switched :-/

 15:42 <cpaelzer> fedora changed ages ago, arch did announce the same last week

 15:42 <sarnold> err .. the first "large change" is switching dbus implementations; the second "it were done today" was the (presumably) smallish wrapper

 15:42 <eslerm> Security eyeballed how much work the wrapper would take during the review. There's a little bit of process state handling, but not much

 15:42 <cpaelzer> maybe the link is worth adding to second the rationale?

 15:43 <eslerm> I can

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I'll add it

 15:44 <slyon> dbus-broker was mostly driven by desktop. I wonder if seb128 is interested in merging v35 (even though it's in universe)? Just to keep it up to date

 15:44 <cpaelzer> I still doubt this can happen without Desktop finding and dedicating resources to it

 15:45 <slyon> adding the wrapper is another story then

 15:45 <cpaelzer> ack

 15:45 <cpaelzer> in the context of the MIR meeting this is interesting but not blocking us

 15:45 <cpaelzer> would one ping Seb and others to ensure they reconsider it again as it is kind of the last chance to do so?

 15:46 <slyon> I can

 15:46 <cpaelzer> thx

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:46 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:46 <cpaelzer> no new entries

 15:46 <cpaelzer> some wnated to discuss offline about base-sets

 15:46 <cpaelzer> any major change already on that front?

 15:47 <eslerm> some in Foundations MM

 15:47 <eslerm> not a major roadmap item atm, but there is related work to do

 15:47 <slyon> verdict was that the Foundations toolchain squad does not have capacity to work on it this cycle, but security might start working on some relevant tooling

 15:47 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:47 <cpaelzer> thanks for the update

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 15:48 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:48 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 15:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:48 <cpaelzer> There seem to be 6 in TODO+Backlog

 15:48 <cpaelzer> given that we are closing in towards FF and with a bit more distance towards release

 15:48 <cpaelzer> could security do a spike to get those handled?

 15:49 <eslerm> I'm training the certs/fips folks for MIRs after this meeting (libgssglue) and setting up similar meeting for fdk-aac-free

 15:49 <cpaelzer> well, that is great to hear

 15:49 <eslerm> the perl ones are more or less done, it would be nice if another perl one was ready

 15:49 <eslerm> libmysofa is still in upstream's hands iiuc

 15:49 <cpaelzer> libmail-mime-perl is in TODO

 15:49 <eslerm> openscap is a backlog security task (not for MIR)

 15:49 <eslerm> I'm not aware of roc-toolkit yet

 15:49 * eslerm looks

 15:50 <cpaelzer> arr, that was one that was switched away

 15:50 <cpaelzer> you might want to remove the card in your jira though

 15:50 <slyon> eslerm: I finished roc-toolkit MIR review today. It's ready for security review

 15:50 <eslerm> \o/

 15:50 <eslerm> I'll try to assign it this week

 15:50 <cpaelzer> I'll ping mirespace if there are any more perl MIRs waiting to get them to us asap for you to be able to use them for training

 15:51 <eslerm> thank you

 15:51 <eslerm> Andrei has worked up a perl fuzzing process for those

 15:52 <cpaelzer> ok, I pinged mirespace about it

 15:52 <eslerm> perl turns out not to be great for training though :)

 15:52 <mirespace> cpaelzer: They all are submitted

 15:52 <cpaelzer> ah

 15:52 <cpaelzer> well, great

 15:52 <cpaelzer> afte rso many months of yet another no one thought of that to be possible :-)

 15:52 <mirespace> hehe... well, let's see how libcryptX evolves :(

 15:52 <sarnold> mirespace: woo :) nice work working those through :)

 15:53 <cpaelzer> mirespace: libcryptx was the bad one enmbedding another version of a lib right?

 15:53 <mirespace> thanks sarnold! :$

 15:53 <mirespace> yes, that one

 15:53 <cpaelzer> *sigh*

 15:53 <cpaelzer> why can't things ever be easy

 15:54 <cpaelzer> mirespace: hmm, reading the comment

 15:54 <cpaelzer> it seems you wait for us on this

 15:54 <cpaelzer> but by being assigned to you it won't show up in any query

 15:54 <cpaelzer> let me löink it here

 15:54 <cpaelzer> for us to have a look now

 15:54 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcryptx-perl/+bug/2046154

 15:54 <cpaelzer> I'd appreciate we all could have a look to conclude on ways forward

 15:55 <cpaelzer> option #1 sounds even worse :-/

 15:56 <cpaelzer> for #2 - sad that even that ed25519 uses the embedded tomcrypt

 15:56 <eslerm> I'll bring this LP up during the fips/certs mir training

 15:56 <slyon> maybe adrien does have an opinion on that?

 15:57 <cpaelzer> I see how #3 is the easiest, but OTOH the one taking way the function users want from this whole stack of tools

 15:57 <eslerm> slyon: I'll ask

 15:57 <mirespace> I'm  working on trying to separate ed255519 from dkim itself at putting it like recommend... there is a sodium based perl lib that that handles also ed255519, but is pretty abandoned

 15:58 <cpaelzer> I think I miss #4 - make this an optional dependency, so that some encryptions work out of the bux and others are a suggest to a universe package

 15:58 <mirespace> (sorry, I put a extra that )

 15:58 <cpaelzer> really I'd love to see adriens and eslerm (after bringing it up) thoughts on this

 15:58 <sarnold> I'd love to know if they're abandoned because they are working fine and don't need maintaining, or if they're so busted that the authors gave up :(

 15:58 <cpaelzer> after all they might say "ok, while not great - using it as is is the least bad option"

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I mean I found that the embedded lib is more up to date than the lib itself

 15:59 <sarnold> ha

 15:59 <cpaelzer> time is running out

 15:59 <mirespace> (sorry, I need to drop ... thank you all)

 15:59 <sarnold> bye mirespace :) thanks

 15:59 <cpaelzer> looking forwadr to seeing your comment on the case later on

 15:59 <cpaelzer> we all need to drop ...

 16:00 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 16:00 <sarnold> noen here

 16:00 <cpaelzer> last minute urgent things?

 16:00 <slyon> nope

 16:00 <cpaelzer> not from me

 16:00 <joalif> none from me

 16:00 <eslerm> thanks all o/

 16:00 <cpaelzer> nice, over and out

 16:00 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 16:00 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)
