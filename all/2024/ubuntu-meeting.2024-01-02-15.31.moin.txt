 15:31 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:31 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:31:12 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:31 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:31 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 15:31 <cpaelzer> let us check who of us is already back

 15:31 <cpaelzer> I've seen sarnold and eslerm before the meeting log started  hi

 15:31 <cpaelzer> IIRC slyon is still out

 15:32 <cpaelzer> so it might be lonely, but still worth to have a look in case something huge came up

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I've already filed an issues for cherrypy3 in server

 15:33 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cherrypy3/+bug/2047821

 15:33 <cpaelzer> and I did an analysis for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nut/+bug/2046263

 15:33 <cpaelzer> I think both are bad and we should not promote them

 15:33 <cpaelzer> details in the cases and the team needs to follow up

 15:34 <cpaelzer> we see a few other new cases

 15:34 <cpaelzer> two I think

 15:34 <cpaelzer> lxml -> pytohn-cssselect (foundations) and duplicity -> setuptools-scm

 15:34 <cpaelzer> I think the former casn wait a week until slyon is here

 15:35 <cpaelzer> doko: ^^ in case you want to raise this in the team this week already

 15:35 <cpaelzer> jbicha: seb128: didrocks: FYI on the duplicity case

 15:35 <cpaelzer> let us know by next week once you had a chance to look

 15:35 <cpaelzer> and then there is a secret which changed in those views

 15:35 <cpaelzer> sarnold: eslerm: do you spot it?

 15:35 <cpaelzer> hint: something is missing

 15:36 <sarnold> they did look rather smaller than I remembered but I couldn't figure out what was gone :)

 15:36 <cpaelzer> maas -> ipmitools is gone after Dimitri and Adam and I sorted that out

 15:36 <sarnold> there's much less perl around ..

 15:36 <sarnold> OMG OMG OMG

 15:36 <cpaelzer> hehe

 15:36 <eslerm> what is the new group they are in?

 15:37 <sarnold> our christmas wishes did come true!

 15:37 <cpaelzer> they are in the maas-community seed which has other things they use but are only on community level of support

 15:37 <cpaelzer> which is true for ipmitools as well, and in future also isc-dhcp-server which got demoted (we moved that as well)

 15:37 <eslerm> that is a good place for them :)

 15:38 <cpaelzer> enough happiness, let us look at a potentially huge queue without many people to process it

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:38 <cpaelzer> I think I can only pick one which is our promised minimal rate (1 per MIR reviewer per week)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> I'll pick the oldest for fairness

 15:39 <cpaelzer> didrocks: slyon: joalif: if you read that later, please consider picking one from the list as well

 15:39 <jamespage> looking

 15:39 <cpaelzer> or we get into bad backlog mode

 15:39 <jamespage> I can pick https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pyasyncore/+bug/2046160

 15:39 <cpaelzer> I'll pick  python3-pyasyncore

 15:39 <eslerm> libqrtr-glib might be worth checking today too, it looks fairly complete ?

 15:39 <jamespage> hah

 15:39 <cpaelzer> you shouldn't do your own jamespage :-)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> at least if avoidable

 15:40 <jamespage> yeah just saw who raised that

 15:40 <cpaelzer> yeah libqrtr-glib seems just a confirmation if we are complete

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I can do that

 15:40 <cpaelzer> jamespage: which of the remaining ones do you want to pick?

 15:42 <cpaelzer> by age it would be https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libparams-validate-perl/+bug/2046181

 15:42 <cpaelzer> ok with that?

 15:42 <jamespage> sure

 15:42 <cpaelzer> assigned and thanks

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:42 <cpaelzer> nothing happened here in the EOY-shutdown phase

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:43 <cpaelzer> nothing new either

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:43 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 15:43 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 15:43 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:43 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 15:43 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I guess not much as well, or was security not allowed to take a timeout as the CVEs do not stop either?

 15:44 <sarnold> we worked short hours with skeleton crews, no MIRs were worked

 15:44 <eslerm> pydantic has a draft review done :)

 15:44 <cpaelzer> sarnold: understandable

 15:45 <cpaelzer> eslerm: lovely

 15:45 <sarnold> iirc libmysofa had some communication with upstream via private email infrastructure that worked better than via canonical email infrastructure

 15:45 <cpaelzer> which is the last to get jaraco out of the picture

 15:45 <cpaelzer> sarnold: yeah you mentioned there were issues, still odd

 15:45 <cpaelzer> well, that is more than I could expect given most were out

 15:45 <cpaelzer> thank you two!

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:46 <cpaelzer> nothing from me in 2024 yet, except - Happy new year everyone!

 15:46 <sarnold> happy new year :) that's it from me, hehe

 15:46 <cpaelzer> wow - in sync!

 15:46 <cpaelzer> in that case, let us not prolong it much more

 15:46 <cpaelzer> except, well

 15:46 <cpaelzer> lunazest: you pinged before

 15:46 <cpaelzer> did you have any question to ask or clarification to make?

 15:50 <sarnold> my guess is no: luna likes to follow along with the various meetings equally

 15:50 <cpaelzer> hmm, not around

 15:50 <cpaelzer> which I'm happy to hear

 15:50 <cpaelzer> but then we do not need to wait

 15:50 <cpaelzer> clsoing out for today

 15:50 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:50 <lunazest> cpaelzer: nope not really started watching Youtube and forgot about the meeting sorry

 15:50 <cpaelzer> hehe

 15:50 <cpaelzer> ok lunazest

 15:51 <sarnold> ooh, enjoy :)

 15:51 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
