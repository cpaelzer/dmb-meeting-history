 16:04 <meetingology> Meeting started at 16:04:54 UTC.  The chair is bdrung.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 16:05 <bdrung> #topic Lightning rounds

 16:05 <bdmurray> bdrung: Are these bug patterns you've committed or are you using them locally?

 16:06 <bdrung> bdmurray, most of the news ones were just locally. I did not pushlish those bug pattern where I do not expect new reports in the future.

 16:06 <bdmurray> that makes sense to me

 16:07 <slyon> enr0n: new systemd changed the generator paths to move to /usr/lib, right?

 16:08 <danilogondolfo> yes, I've got into this problem hehe

 16:08 <slyon> I see netplan FTBFS in unstable and noble. But I guess that's actually a good thing, so we can move away from /lib

 16:08 <enr0n> slyon: yes I believe so

 16:09 <vorlon> Ubuntu has been "usr merged" for several cycles; as long as your files don't go missing on upgrade due to the /lib -> /usr/lib move, it's fine to use the new path

 16:09 <vorlon> there's discussion on debian-devel about some of the pitfalls, mostly to do with Replaces: between packages at the same time as paths change

 16:10 <slyon> ACK. I think for Netplan it's not too special. We've been shipping the generator in /lib/ for legacy reasons, but I think the move should be pretty simple

 16:12 <bdmurray> Skia: What happened upstream with klibc?

 16:13 <Skia> nothing yet, the MR I uploaded to noble is still not merged: https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/klibc/-/merge_requests/12

 16:15 <bdmurray> Oh, debian modified coreutils ... got it

 16:15 <Skia> what happened instead is that Debian reverted upstream's behavior change in coreutils, so that cp and mv don't start breaking all the scripts of the world, and added a deprecation warning that upstream forgot

 16:16 <Skia> but I also red that they still need to fix broken cp/mv usage in packages, and that should include klibc

 16:16 <adrien> the change in coreutils is not new anymore by now though

 16:17 <Skia> according to the discussions upstream, it's not new, but it's not widely shipped by distributions either, so in a sense, it's quite new

 16:17 <bdrung> enough time to read the reports. moving on.

 16:18 <bdrung> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:18 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:18 <bdrung> bug #1969394

 16:18 <adrien> yeah, it's new for us because 9.2 and 9.3 had not been shipped in debian and ubuntu

 16:18 <Skia> correct

 16:19 <bdrung> that update-manager bug is about UI changes and therefore belongs to the desktop team

 16:20 <bdrung> bug #2017401

 16:24 <vorlon> that one should be taken for noble, but there's no action for Foundations at the moment because there's a dependency on changes to livepatch to expose the necessary information about whether a reboot is required

 16:26 <vorlon> I think we should go ahead and target this

 16:27 <bdrung> okay, i'll tag it.

 16:28 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:29 <bdrung> bug #2041518 is for the desktop team

 16:29 <bdrung> bug #2041831

 16:32 <vorlon> I'll ask the Desktop Team to investigate

 16:32 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:32 <bdrung> nothing for us

 16:32 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:33 <bdrung> nothing for us

 16:33 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:34 <bdrung> nothing marked for us, but 12 unknown

 16:34 <bdrung> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:34 <bdrung> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:35 <bdrung> handing over to vorlon

 16:35 <vorlon> per ginggs we can ignore the python3-defaults stuff, he and doko are working through that

 16:35 <vorlon> apt aiui is with juliank

 16:35 <vorlon> libcgi-pm-perl blocked for a little bit

 16:36 <bdrung> i like to take pycryptodome which would be a follow up on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pycryptodome/+bug/2039968

 16:37 <vorlon> sounds like libcgi-pm-perl was with cpete, and needs some autopkgtests triggered cleverly

 16:37 <vorlon> cpete: can you follow up with this? if there are questions about how to get the tests properly run, feel free to ask (me, #ubuntu-release, someone)

 16:37 <cpete> ack

 16:38 <vorlon> python-secretstorage, IRC logs say cpete was touching this one as well?

 16:38 <vorlon> at least the vorta autopkgtest part

 16:40 <vorlon> let's pass that one to adrien

 16:40 <vorlon> python-secretstorage: adrien

 16:40 <vorlon> there's also an MIR issue in there too fwiw

 16:40 <vorlon> Component mismatch entries

 16:40 <vorlon> python3-secretstorage/amd64 in main cannot depend on python3-jeepney in universe

 16:40 <vorlon> s390-tools, let's see if this is waiting for an AA

 16:40 <vorlon> it is

 16:40 <slyon> hmm.. jeepney rings a bell

 16:41 <vorlon> I'll take that (s390-tools + s390-tools-signed)

 16:41 <slyon> (but I can't find context, currently)

 16:41 <vorlon> boost1.74

 16:41 <slyon> It might have been a MIR candidate in the past.

 16:41 <vorlon> "only" stuck for 16 days, so we haven't looked at this yet :)

 16:42 <vorlon> doko uploaded it but it was a no-change rebuild

 16:42 <vorlon> bdrung: can you take this?

 16:42 <vorlon> brltty blocks on liblouis, which is desktop's

 16:43 <bdrung> i would prefer to follow up on pycryptodome (to help the python migration)

 16:43 <vorlon> dpkg was my upload, but the sbuild autopkgtest behavior is knotty

 16:43 <vorlon> dbungert: can you have a look at dpkg vs sbuild?

 16:43 <dbungert> vorlon: ack

 16:43 <vorlon> libtirpc vs glibc: danilogondolfo ?

 16:43 <danilogondolfo> vorlon, ack

 16:44 <vorlon> socat: xypron?

 16:44 <xypron> ok

 16:44 <vorlon> python-werkzeug: slyon?

 16:44 <slyon> ok

 16:44 <vorlon> python-apt, I'm assuming juliank is on this one also

 16:45 <vorlon> cmake: mkukri?

 16:45 <mkukri> ack

 16:45 <vorlon> debconf: enr0n?

 16:45 <enr0n> vorlon: ack

 16:45 <vorlon> I'll take acl

 16:45 <vorlon> netplan.io vs wpa: ogayot?

 16:45 <ogayot> vorlon: ack

 16:46 <slyon> ^ probably just flaky

 16:46 <vorlon> fwiw if someone figures out the glibc stuff on debconf or libtirpc, maybe it also applies to binutils

 16:46 <vorlon> not going to assign binutils at the moment though

 16:46 <vorlon> btrfs-progs is i386 dep-wait, I'll take that

 16:46 <vorlon> and that's the list

 16:46 <vorlon> bdrung:

 16:47 <bdrung> i looked at boost1.74. the fist test failure is a dependency issue and i probably just have to retry the test.
