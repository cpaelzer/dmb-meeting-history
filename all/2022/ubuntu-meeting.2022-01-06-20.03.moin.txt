 20:03 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:03:02 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:03 <diddledani> there we go

 20:03 <nicoz-> :D lol

 20:03 <diddledani> thanks :-)

 20:03 <nicoz-> ;*

 20:03 <diddledani> here comes the big paste

 20:03 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 6th January 2022 (yes, 2022!). The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:03 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:03 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:03 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:03 <Wild_Man> I have the same problem

 20:03 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:03 <Mr_Pan> me  ?

 20:04 <Mr_Pan> Hello everyone

 20:26 <Bashing-om> congrats here too Mr_Pan :D

 20:27 <Mr_Pan> :)

 20:27 <Carlin0> Hello, I started using Ubuntu in 2009 and having previous experiences with linux I immediately dedicated myself to helping less experienced users both on the Italian forum and on IRC

 20:27 <Carlin0> Unfortunately my presence on the forum stopped only 3 years later ( in which I wrote about 7500 msg https://forum.ubuntu-it.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=89839 ) due to misunderstandings and disagreements with the forum staff

 20:27 <diddledani> OK, next up we have Carlin0. Could you please introduce yourself to the board and share the links for your wiki page or forum post and your launchpad.net profile

 20:27 <Mr_Pan> thank u so much ... Vielen Dank ... Molte Grazie

 20:28 <Carlin0> I finished... and thank you for your time ;)

 20:28 <diddledani> ok, question the same as for Mr_Pan, you've signed the Code of Conduct. Did you, and do you understand it, and do you confirm that you will be held to it for the duration of your membership if granted?

 20:29 <Carlin0> of course diddledani

 20:29 <Carlin0> But I continued on IRC where I found a better environment for myself, and my commitment to helping and maintaining a clean environment was recognized with the proposal to become an "Ubuntu Italian IRC Operator" in 2018

 20:29 <Carlin0> In the future I would also like to dedicate myself to documentation, despite the obstacles that the Italian community poses me (I'm working on it)

 20:30 <diddledani> what kind of obstacles do you see with working in the Italian community?

 20:30 <nicoz-> no obstacles.. we are solving everything

 20:31 <nicoz-> had problems in the past with the ubuntu-it forum staff

 20:31 <Carlin0> diddledani, the Italian documentation group is mainly coordinated on the forum and Iâ€™m banned from the forum

 20:32 <nicoz-> but I know Carlino is bringing a great job to the wiki and on irc... a very experienced user

 20:32 <diddledani> ah, I see, thanks for that.

 20:33 <nicoz-> a user with a very friendly approach and always present and with excellent solutions

 20:33 <Bashing-om> Carlin0: Presently there is a big push to get our docs updated. How will these changes in procedure affect your effort to contribute to documentation translations ?

 20:34 <nicoz-> carlin0 is not very practical with English but is very useful on both forum and irc

 20:35 <Carlin0> Bashing-om, translation is not really my forte, but I can try.

 20:35 <diddledani> Thanks for helping out, nicoz- . Your input here is greatly appreciated :-)

 20:35 <nicoz-> ;)*

 20:37 <nicoz-> As a member, I tell you that Carlino deserves more than me membership... in the years he contributed more than me

 20:37 <Kilos> lol

 20:37 <nicoz-> is a very experienced user... see ubuntulog... almost always its supports help people

 20:38 <Mr_Pan> he will write guides for the italian ubuntu site

 20:38 <nicoz-> in presence and constancy, one of the best of the Italian IRC team

 20:38 <diddledani> any more questions from teh board members?

 20:39 <Kilos> and plenty support

 20:39 <Kilos> not here
