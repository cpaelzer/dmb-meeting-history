 15:00 <bdmurray> #topic Lightning Round

 15:01 <sil2100> o/

 15:01 <bdmurray> We've posted our status in discourse again https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-31-march-2022/27409/3

 15:01 <sil2100> I need to add mine, will do that later

 15:01 <bdmurray> Let's take a moment to look them over and ask any questions

 15:03 <bdmurray> Is there a proper way to write RISCV or RISCV64?

 15:03 <jawn-smith> The official foundation stylizes it as RISC-V

 15:03 <sil2100> To me riscv64 is always the correct way for when we're talking about the Ubuntu arch, but otherwise I'd use RISC-V

 15:03 <jawn-smith> ^

 15:04 <bdmurray> Got it

 15:04 <bdmurray> Any other burning questions?

 15:04 <bdmurray> Alrighty then moving on

 15:04 <bdmurray> #topic Release Incoming Bugs

 15:05 <bdmurray> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:05 <bdmurray> bug 1966381 is about the configuration of system-oomd

 15:05 <ubottu> Bug 1966381 in systemd (Ubuntu) "applications crash that never crashed under Ubuntu-20.04" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1966381

 15:05 <bdmurray> Is that installed by default?

 15:06 <jawn-smith> Yes, as of Jammy

 15:07 <bdmurray> This sounds like something we should card and sort out

 15:07 <bdmurray> So let's do that

 15:07 <bdmurray> bug 1923052

 15:07 <ubottu> Bug 1923052 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "screen reader does not read ubiquity window" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1923052

 15:08 <bdmurray> I'll test that with the Beta

 15:08 <bdmurray> bug 1958720 is still on the server-todo

 15:09 <ubottu> Bug 1958720 in pyyaml (Ubuntu) "python3-yaml and python3-six are not co-installable with python-is-python2 in jammy" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1958720

 15:09 <bdmurray> Let's check with cpaelzer about the priority of that

 15:09 <bdmurray> bug 1962751 is still incomplete

 15:09 <ubottu> Bug 1962751 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "nvidia drivers not installed automatically" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962751

 15:09 <bdmurray> I believe that type of laptop will be waiting for us in London so while late we could test it then.

 15:10 <bdmurray> bug 1068591 was still tagged and I've fixed that

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1068591 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu Jammy) "release upgrade should deactivate /etc/apt/preferences*" [Medium, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1068591

 15:10 <bdmurray> bug 1962454 is still a nice to have so leaving

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1962454 in apport (Ubuntu) "Oops pages show wrong time window in JournalErrors" [Low, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962454

 15:10 <sil2100> At least it doesn't seem to be widespread, maybe more very laptop specific (the nvidia install issue)

 15:10 <bdmurray> bug 1966416

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1966416 in pam (Ubuntu) "pam_faillock does not actually deny login after given number of failures" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1966416

 15:12 <bdmurray> that looks like it bears investigation

 15:12 <bdmurray> let's target and card it

 15:13 <bdmurray> bug 1966589

 15:13 <ubottu> Bug 1966589 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Upgrader unable to contact snap store" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1966589

 15:13 <bdmurray> I actually think this might be an issue with the firefox package, one could way to test it would be to edit sources.list and see if the same issue happens. I'll do that today.

 15:14 <bdmurray> If it ends up being u-r-u we can card it.

 15:14 <bdmurray> bug 1962843 doesn't have an easy reproducer yet

 15:14 <ubottu> Bug 1962843 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Guest OS customization fail for ubuntu 22.04 desktop in vsphere due to  adding 'shutdown.target' in file /usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.socket" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962843

 15:15 <bdmurray> However enr0n will have a look at it

 15:15 <bdmurray> But let's not card it yet

 15:15 <cpaelzer> bdmurray: thanks for the ping, it is best effort on Robies list atm

 15:16 <bdmurray> cpaelzer: ack, we'll think about how important the bug is

 15:16 <bdmurray> bug 1965652

 15:16 <ubottu> Bug 1965652 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "machine froze when upgrading impish->jammy" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1965652

 15:17 <bdmurray> I'd think this was the gvfs crash enr0n found but leok gave us some different crash files

 15:17 <bdmurray> I'll look at that too.

 15:17 <bdmurray> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ii-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:17 <bdmurray> 0

 15:18 <bdmurray> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:18 <bdmurray> there's the /boot size bug and the zfs snapshot

 15:19 <bdmurray> I think we are waiting to here from didier about the zfs snapshot patch

 15:19 <jawn-smith> I'm planning to look into that when I'm not on +1

 15:19 <bdmurray> Alright thanks

 15:19 <bdmurray> Okay, that's everything for bugs

 15:19 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:19 <bdmurray> jawn-smith:

 15:20 <jawn-smith> There's a long list today

 15:20 <jawn-smith> most likely related to rebuilds and infrastructure issues

 15:20 <jawn-smith> first up is boost1.74

 15:20 <jawn-smith> ginggs: you were looking at that last week

 15:20 <ogayot> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:21 <ginggs> jawn-smith: yup, i think esys-particle can be removed (no reverse deps)

 15:21 <jawn-smith> oh excellent

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Can you file a removal bug?

 15:21 <ginggs> sure

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:22 <jawn-smith> gpgme was with alexghiti

 15:22 <alexghiti> I have a fix that works, but I'm not quite happy with it

 15:22 <jawn-smith> Okay great, glad you're making progress

 15:22 <jawn-smith> pillow is just waiting for tests to run

 15:22 <jawn-smith> I retried firejail vs libselinux before this meeting, and it was "neutral"

 15:22 <jawn-smith> so I think that will migrate

 15:24 <jawn-smith> that systemd/unknown looks suspicious, but we're not trying arm64 things at the moment due to infra issues

 15:24 <juliank> as a short cloud status: bos01 is totally down since 03:00 UTC, so if you retry arm64 stuff now it runs on bos02. but beware queue sizes and limited capacity and only do urgent stuff

 15:24 <jawn-smith> xypron: you were looking at r-cran-openssl

 15:24 <xypron> jawn-smith: yes

 15:24 <jawn-smith> Any progress?

 15:25 <xypron> LP # 1966307 autopackage tests fail fix is committed

 15:25 <xypron> LP #1966307

 15:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1966307 in r-cran-openssl (Ubuntu) "autopackage tests fail" [Low, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1966307

 15:25 <jawn-smith> oh excellent, does anyone want to sponsor?

 15:25 <jawn-smith> Thanks xypron

 15:26 <ginggs> if it's fixed-committed it's uploaded but not migrated

 15:26 <ginggs> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/r-cran-openssl/1.4.6+dfsg-1ubuntu1

 15:26 <ginggs> ^ sponsored

 15:27 <jawn-smith> Oh right, thanks!

 15:27 <jawn-smith> Moving on, ltrace is FTBFS on ppc64el and riscv64

 15:27 <ogayot> I looked at ltrace on ppc64el

 15:27 <jawn-smith> Who wants ltrace?

 15:28 <jawn-smith> Excellent, do you want to keep looking into it?

 15:28 <ogayot> sure, I'll take it

 15:28 <jawn-smith> thanks!

 15:28 <doko> riscv64 is not a regression, only ppc64el is (for ltrace)

 15:28 <bdmurray> Somebody needs to run the new r-cran-openssl w/ openssl.

 15:29 <jawn-smith> ginggs just volunteered to trigger that test, thanks!

 15:29 <jawn-smith> avahi vs libreoffice is likely just flakiness

 15:29 <jawn-smith> but it's arm64 so we'll wait

 15:29 <ginggs> i can do it, but r-cran-openssl maybe broke r-cran-httr on s390x

 15:29 <jawn-smith> boost-defaults is just waiting

 15:30 <jawn-smith> bridge-utils vs firejail

 15:30 <jawn-smith> having looked at firejail tests earlier I'm betting this is just flakiness

 15:30 <jawn-smith> yeah, code 14

 15:30 <jawn-smith> retried on ppc64el but waiting on armhf for now

 15:31 <jawn-smith> build-essential has lots of regressions, but they mostly appear to be arm related

 15:31 <jawn-smith> which is suspicious this week

 15:31 <jawn-smith> there are a few that aren't, so who wants to look at gjs vs build-essential on ppc64el?

 15:32 <jawn-smith> enr0n: gjs vs build-essential

 15:32 <jawn-smith> I'll look at gromacs and libassuan

 15:33 * jawn-smith hoards the amd64 issues

 15:33 <jawn-smith> toml vs build-essential. since it's also ppc64el would you like it enr0n ?

 15:33 <jawn-smith> feel free to say no

 15:33 <enr0n> I can take it

 15:33 <jawn-smith> okay, volunteers to look at the bzip2 failures?

 15:34 <jawn-smith> systemd can likely be ignored for now due to arm stuff

 15:34 <jawn-smith> but dahdi-linux vs bzip2 should be looked at

 15:34 <bdmurray> badpkg: Test dependencies are unsatisfiable.

 15:35 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: dahdi-linux vs bzip2

 15:35 <jawn-smith> cron is just arm stuff

 15:35 <jawn-smith> skipping lots of arm stuff

 15:35 <jawn-smith> oh systemd vs cron is amd64

 15:35 <jawn-smith> any volunteers

 15:36 <jawn-smith> dbungert: want to look at that?

 15:36 <dbungert> jawn-smith: ack

 15:36 <jawn-smith> thanks!

 15:37 <jawn-smith> gnupg2 has non-arm stuff

 15:38 <jawn-smith> debuerreotype vs gnupg2. xypron can you look at this?

 15:38 <jawn-smith> livecd-rootfs vs gnupg2 I'll toss over to mwhudson

 15:39 <jawn-smith> I restarted extrepo because it looked flaky

 15:39 <jawn-smith> I also restarted the golang-defaults test before this meeting and it also passed

 15:40 <jawn-smith> ubuntu-image blocking gdisk seems like something I should look into

 15:40 <jawn-smith> even though it's arm64

 15:40 * jawn-smith skips more arm stuff

 15:41 <jawn-smith> who doesn't currently have a proposed-migration task?

 15:41 <alexghiti> o/

 15:41 <ginggs> o/

 15:41 <doko> o/

 15:41 <ginggs> i assume clicking r-cran-openssl doesn't count :)

 15:41 <jawn-smith> doko says to ignore python3-stdlib-extensions

 15:42 <jawn-smith> runescape vs java-common. any takers?

 15:42 <bdmurray> ginggs: did you really click it or use the script?

 15:42 <jawn-smith> alexghiti: how's your java?

 15:43 <alexghiti> Not that great but I can have a look!

 15:43 <ginggs> bdmurray: actually c) none of the above - copied URL, added trigger, pasted into browser -- did not use the script

 15:43 <jawn-smith> thanks!

 15:43 <jawn-smith> glibc vs libcap2: doko?

 15:44 <doko> ok

 15:44 <jawn-smith> oh that's still arm

 15:44 <jawn-smith> systemd vs libcap2 ginggs ?

 15:44 <ginggs> sure

 15:44 <jawn-smith> and that's everyone

 15:44 <jawn-smith> back to you bdmurray

 15:44 <doko> ftbfs ...

 15:44 <doko> https://people.canonical.com/~ginggs/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20220317-jammy-jammy.html#foundations-bugs-team

 15:45 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:45 <bdmurray> which is ftbfs

 15:46 <doko> acpi-support?

 15:46 <doko> gcc-11 retried the Nth time

 15:46 <bdmurray> I still need to look at acpi-support

 15:46 <jawn-smith> bdmurray had volunteered for acpi-support last week

 15:46 <doko> gpgme1.0

 15:46 <jawn-smith> alexghiti has a patch

 15:46 <doko> that we already had

 15:47 <doko> localechooser

 15:47 <ginggs> not a regression

 15:47 <doko> ltrace already assigned

 15:47 <jawn-smith> pillow was with doko

 15:47 <doko> is already uploaded

 15:47 <jawn-smith> vim was with me

 15:48 <jawn-smith> I think it's just flaky

 15:48 <jawn-smith> but I haven't looked very closely due to being on +1 this week

 15:48 <ginggs> jawn-smith: i'll retry vim on ppc64el

 15:48 <jawn-smith> ginggs: thanks!

 15:48 <jawn-smith> as for other business: today is a half day for me. I'm EOD in about an hour

 15:53 <bdmurray> I'm on holiday next week

 15:53 <dbungert> ginggs: systmed has a timeout test failure that is affecting several pacakges, we can probably hit them all with https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/request.cgi?release=jammy&arch=amd64&package=systemd&trigger=libcap2%2F1%3A2.44-1build3&trigger=bzip2%2F1.0.8-5build1&trigger=cron%2F3.0pl1-137ubuntu3 - what do you think?

 15:54 <dbungert> *systemd of course

 15:54 <bdmurray> alright, thanks everybody!
