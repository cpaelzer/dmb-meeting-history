 17:48 <ddstreet> ok that's all the previous actions

 17:48 <ddstreet> #topic discussion

 17:48 <ddstreet> i have one item on the agenda

 17:48 <ddstreet> #subtopic I (ddstreet) would like to start a discussion on a non-participating member policy

 17:48 <teward> ddstreet: given the other thing perhaps the no longer participating thing should be a TB decison

 17:48 <teward> as a matter of policy

 17:49 <teward> lol coincidence thats the topic now

 17:49 <ddstreet> mm, i'm 100% fine with the TB doing the actual member removal/addition/modification...but i'm not ok with the TB deciding membership policy for the team

 17:49 <teward> i propose we come up with something to present to the TB for their ratification

 17:50 <teward> so they can sign off, etc. but that way it gets proper review, etc.

 17:50 <ddstreet> i have no problem presenting our decision to the TB, and if they want to or need to ratify it, that's fine too

 17:50 <ddstreet> as far as i'm concerned, that step is simply an implementation detail

 17:51 <ddstreet> so i think we're in agreement on that particular part right?

 17:51 <ddstreet> just to confirm

 17:52 <ddstreet> teward you still there?

 17:52 <teward> mmmmm...

 17:52 <teward> ye typing from a phone ya impatient

 17:53 <ddstreet> ah ok

 17:53 <ddstreet> no hurry just checking :)

 17:53 <teward> i think my issue is a lack of clarity overall from a policy perspective that is apparently present at all levels - namely does a team get to decide its own policies for removals of members etc.

 17:54 <teward> can i suggest we carry over this action item and discussion to next meeting?  i want to poke a few individuals first

 17:54 <teward> get a general pulse on that core question

 17:55 <teward> i have no issue starting a discussion on how we shoukd handle inactives but with that issue being a big one on a radar far higher than ours I want to get that issue clarified at a higher level first

 17:55 <ddstreet> since this team has only the 3 of us, and generally we have no problem at all currently with lack of participation, i'm ok deferring to the next meeting...but, i really would like to make progress on this item in that meeting

 17:55 <teward> ok

 17:56 <ddstreet> i'll say that i am personally unconvinced that there can be a single policy that applies to all teams that covers what a 'non-participating member' is

 17:56 <ddstreet> and certainly not how to best handle the situation

 17:56 <ddstreet> but i think it's ok to give them 2 weeks to try to come up with a policy before we start on our own :)

 17:56 <rbasak> o/

 17:57 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet at next meeting, re-raise issue of non-participating member policy

 17:57 * meetingology ddstreet at next meeting, re-raise issue of non-participating member policy

 17:57 <ddstreet> rbasak looks like you have something to add to the topic?

 17:57 <rbasak> Something I was hoping to do was to ask the backporters team to ratify its responsibilities, as I had originally proposed in the ubuntu-devel@ thread during the backporter reboot discussion

 17:57 <rbasak> That's slightly related to this topic.

 17:58 <rbasak> Let me find a link

 17:58 <teward> i was just gonna ask for a link lol

 17:58 <ddstreet> sure i'm all for that, i think best to put an action item for the next meeting and/or ML discussion

 17:58 <ddstreet> if that sounds ok to everyone

 17:58 <rbasak> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2021-July/041559.html, under "Team Responsibilities"

 17:58 <rbasak> "Handle your own process reform and membership management..."

 17:59 <rbasak> So that's done, and the TB ratifies, then you'd be handling your own membership management.

 17:59 <ddstreet> no disagreement from me.

 17:59 <teward> if the TB ratifies that part i have no issues then

 17:59 <rbasak> However, given what Steve raised with the DMB, that might need further discussion with the TB because maybe that wouldn't be acceptable to them.

 18:00 <rbasak> So *if* that's done sorry

 18:01 <ddstreet> personally, i'd prefer to just assume we will get approval and make progress based on that assumption. if it turns out that assumption was wrong, things can be reevaluated later. i do not want to delay our own discussion and decision making however

 18:01 <rbasak> OTOH, maybe this team will follow the pattern of some of the other teams (SRU, archive, release) in managing their own membership, unlike the DMB which is vote-based.

 18:01 <teward> rbasak: on steves point DMB never had any say in SRU reviewers either and I think Backporters falls into that category

 18:01 <rbasak> Yeah probably

 18:01 <teward> of there is precedent to be handled independently of DMB entirely

 18:02 <rbasak> So maybe best to proceed on the assumption that my "Team responsibilities" section would be ratified by both the TB and the backporters team?

 18:02 <ddstreet> just fyi, there is an existing action item that is assigned to mapreri to "propose text for membership process to add to KB page"

 18:02 <ddstreet> so clearly, the assumption so far as been that the team will decide its own membership process

 18:03 <ddstreet> the TB of course can clarify if that assumption is wrong, but i see no reason to change anything until that clarification is made from the TB

 18:03 <teward> given the... other chaos... can we get the TB'S blessing on backporters managing our own members though?,

 18:03 <rbasak> Anyway, I was intending to send an email to the backporters list asking if that text is something you'd be willing to ratify, and then take it up with the TB if the answer was yes.

 18:03 <rbasak> But I was watching this meeting and on this topic that seemed relevant, so I thought it might be helpful to mention it now.

 18:03 <ddstreet> yes, i think it's best to carry the discussion of the specific text to ratify to the ML

 18:04 <teward> agreed

 18:04 <ddstreet> ok i can throw up an action for that then, rbasak if you want to send the email i'll assign to you? :)

 18:04 <rbasak> Assign me to send the email you mean? Sure.

 18:05 <ddstreet> #action rbasak send email to ML to clarify specific wording of team responsibilities, for proposal to TB for ratification

 18:05 * meetingology rbasak send email to ML to clarify specific wording of team responsibilities, for proposal to TB for ratification

 18:05 <ddstreet> hopefully i worded that well enough :)

 18:06 <rbasak> Yep, thanks

 18:06 <ddstreet> and i do still have the action added earlier to bring this topic back up next meeting, so we can review what's ahppend on the ML then

 18:06 <teward> oh robie grab me aftet tbe

 18:06 <teward> after the meeting

 18:06 <ddstreet> ok i think that topic is done for now, so aob

 18:06 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 18:06 <ddstreet> anyhting else?

 18:06 <teward> not from me

 18:07 <ddstreet> only thing i will mention is for members (teward ;-) to be sure to check the ML, i did send a couple emails to start discussion threads, e.g. no-bug backports, etc.

 18:07 <ddstreet> no hurry though :)

 18:07 <ddstreet> ok i think we're done then, thanks all!

 18:07 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
