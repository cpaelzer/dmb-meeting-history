 12:25 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board - 21 December 2022

 12:25 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:25:48 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:25 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:27 <diddledani> applicants, please wait till you're called. Here comes the big paste introduction to start the meeting:

 12:27 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 21 December 2022. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:27 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:27 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:27 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:27 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:27 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:27 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:28 <diddledani> So, first up we have Kangarooo Jānis. Kangaroo, could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement, and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad account...

 12:28 <Kangarooo> Hello! I'm Jānis from Latvia, Rīga, middle one of 3 Baltic states, of centre of universe, where christmas tree was invented, so happy cristmas, I'm just a regular normal Ubuntu user i think from 2008 i was able to start original on post sent to my classmate ubuntu CD installation finally and been moving from Ubuntu to Ubuntu remix then away from slow Unity and sometime putting gnome2 to Xubuntu and Lubuntu and when

 12:28 <Kangarooo> Kubuntu i think after ~2016 became fast then only on that and infecting people computers with this antivirus for Bug #1.

 12:28 <Kangarooo> Im digital advertisment specialist, a bit designer and its animator, technical house building architect, wordpress front-end and administrator and server admiinstrator apache nginx and other using servers LTS- 16 18 20.

 12:28 <Kangarooo> My Wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kangarooo and my Launchpad is https://launchpad.net/~Kangarooo

 12:29 <diddledani> oh, I apologise for using the wrong part of your name to address you, Janis

 12:30 <Kangarooo> Thats not a bug diddledani :)

 12:30 <diddledani> Please stand by while the board members review the details you've provided, and then I'll invite them to ask any questions they may have :-)

 12:33 <diddledani> are we all ready? I'd like to now invite the board members to ask any questions they have...

 12:33 <Wildmanne39> Kangarooo, I do not see any testimonials do you have someone here to vouch for your contributions

 12:34 <Kangarooo> oh no, no one, ive been to loco 3 release parties and on email contacted, but bug reports are in my launchpad Launchpad Bugs reported totaly 399 (update: 928), commented other bugs 386

 12:34 <Kangarooo> Questions : 2 (update: 18)

 12:36 <Kangarooo> can i call now from linux centre for someone to join? if they will remember me, but theres no contribution other then bug repors and installing people computers- around 50 now. so can call clients. but they wont be able to know how to join irc.

 12:36 <Kilos> Kangarooo  are you a member of any loco?

 12:38 <Kilos> joining a loco and working with them shows your commitment and you get those you work with to do your testimonials

 12:38 <Bashing-om> Kangarooo: In the same vien of contributions - the emphasis is on "sustained contributions" - though you have activity from as early as 2009 - what contributions have you made recently and what is the state now of Latviešu Latvian Ubuntu LoCo Team ?

 12:38 <Kangarooo> Latvian Loco but its innactive and we have tried to talk about it, so i was allways wanting to make it active. Still members made loco events for who was following lists. LoCo went to 3 Release party presentation events. Then from about 10 business idea presentations, 20 contests and 30 hackathons got natural courage to speak and present in public layman and techical term talking modes, so could organize presentation

 12:38 <Kangarooo> also now. So Then in 2020 wanted to join repair cafe where people fix bikes and electronics, to fix computers and infect with X/L/K/Ubuntu, but it was because of covid canceled. So want to make it active now.

 12:39 <mapreri> FWIW (since you mentioned it) I don't think I would like to consider installing ubuntu in customer's as something relevant for the membership :)

 12:40 <Kangarooo> Then just bug reports and askubuntu.com

 12:40 <Kangarooo> and forum

 12:40 <Kangarooo> just now joined discourse

 12:40 <diddledani> I note that a few references on your wiki page mention now using ubuntu releases that are out of support... are you still using those or did you not update those parts of your wiki page?

 12:44 <diddledani> do you have any record of those release parties, and presentations to the public?

 12:44 <Kangarooo> Now Ubuntu with gnome and Kubuntu, on some old computers is lubuntu and home data server lubuntu. Ubuntu remix out of support? That was amazing for smal screen. Nothing else but that also dont have now. Which other ones out of support? Other non ubuntu mentioned that have tested them. "tested some time "

 12:46 <mapreri> I reckon he is likely mentioning the A/S/L part that mentions ubuntu 10.04 and I have no idea why (nor I know what A/S/L means)

 12:46 <mapreri> probably history?

 12:46 <Kangarooo> oh i was filming- i need to find. I was suggesting to make all social networks and to put on youtube but no one had time to continue talking, i just prepared channels. Let me check if i uploaded in that one unpublished for now.

 12:46 <mapreri> since it goes from there all the way to WSL 22.04

 12:46 <diddledani> FTR: my pronouns are she/her :-)

 12:47 <Kangarooo> Age/Sex/Location description - but for IT it would be experience in mind of related topic- Ubuntu field

 12:47 <Kangarooo> its from some irc slang i learned

 12:48 <mapreri> diddledani: sorry :( - I keep forgetting

 12:48 <diddledani> ok, I think we'll have to move onto the vote, because we're running out of time

 12:48 <diddledani> no worries, mapreri

 12:48 <diddledani> #vote Kangaroo's membership application

 12:48 <meetingology> Please vote on: Kangaroo's membership application

 12:48 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 12:48 <diddledani> #voters Bashing-om diddledani mapreri Wildmanne39 Kilos

 12:48 <meetingology> Current voters: Bashing-om, Kilos, Wildmanne39, diddledani, mapreri

 12:48 <Kangarooo> I didnt had time to apply earlier but at fist i forgot- was busy with filing bug reports for crashes and following up, keeping old systems to answer if in previous version is fixed, so life took turn to getting interested in bug fixing and didnt made other things.

 12:48 <Kangarooo> In future want to manage or build Baltic (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania) Ubuntu consocium and starting with steps in helping fix Latvian Loco activity.

 12:48 <Kangarooo> Want to make better flavour for 1st time users, since im installing and some people strugle so need to set it up. Currently installed for about 50 computers all flavours.

 12:48 <Kangarooo> And need to learn how to start new project on github and launchpad so with idea and first bad scripts, so people could join and make adjustments or add gui for everyday people.

 12:48 <diddledani> (did I catch everyone in the voters command?)

 12:49 <mapreri> looks right to me

 12:49 <Wildmanne39> I think so

 12:53 <diddledani> -1 Unfortunately I'm voting no at this time, because I would like to see more evidence of sustained and significant contributions to the community, and at least one testimonial from someone else in the community. I also like to see wiki pages be updated for the application to remove out of date information.

 12:55 <meetingology> Motion denied

 12:55 <Kilos> work where ubuntu users can give you testimonials

 12:56 <Kilos> sorry

 12:56 <Kangarooo> How they should look like, for what contributions? In loco we didnt finish any plans

 12:56 <mapreri> FWIW, you also mentioned the forums and askubuntu, but looking at those I also don't see any sustained contributions there.

 12:56 <diddledani> I'm sorry that you didn't get in this time around, Kangarooo, but please do keep going and don't feel disheartened by this result. We'd love to see you come back again in the future when you have more evidence/testimonials

 12:57 <Wildmanne39> Kangarooo, Yes need to have testimonials for next time and wait about six months so you have sustained contributions

 12:57 <diddledani> is everyone ok to continue to mIk3_08's application? we'll be overrunning...

 12:57 <Kilos> go

 12:57 <Wildmanne39> Yes

 12:57 <Kangarooo> ok, if as advertisment manager i set up loco social networks till end so that more people join from website

 12:57 <mapreri> I'd rather we reschedule tbh

 12:58 <mapreri> I could continue, but I have other business to take care of myself

 12:58 <diddledani> ok, next up we have Michael Quisido III. mIk3_08, could you introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement and links to your wiki and launchpad?

 12:59 <Bashing-om> I can go on.

 12:59 <mIk3_08> Hi everyone. I am mike (mIk3_08) I always love Linux because when we say security, it always comes to my mind its "LINUX". Im active in ubuntuforum community for a while now and also in launchpad  All the details of my activities here in ubuntu are all in my wiki page. just see my application. Thanks a lot.

 12:59 <mIk3_08> here is my wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mike-quisido

 13:00 <diddledani> ok, I'll give the board a few moments to read through and then it's question time :-)

 13:01 <mIk3_08> Thanks a lot diddledani.... copy.

 13:01 <mapreri> mIk3_08: I see you have nobody in your testimonials section in the wiki.  do you have any?

 13:02 <Bashing-om> mIk3_08: Anyone can write anything in a WIKI - how are we to assertion that what you have written is the truth ?

 13:03 <diddledani> mIk3_08, in your contributions you've listed several projects along with "completed" or not. Could you details what those contributions included and how you determined they are "completed"?

 13:03 <mapreri> rather, I have troubles understanding what your contributions even are.  you just listed some programs there…?

 13:04 <mIk3_08> As of now.. none.. Thanks too early I think for testimonials. I still don't have any achievements currently. and about the completed parts of my contributions, I might update for that for more details.

 13:05 <mIk3_08> Thats too early I think for testimonials. I still don't have any achievements currently. and about the completed parts of my contributions, I might update for that for more details.

 13:06 <mIk3_08> mapreri im current active in ubuntuforum

 13:06 <mIk3_08> ubuntuforum.com

 13:07 <mIk3_08> ubuntuforums.org

 13:09 <mIk3_08> diddledani i may update some links for that if needed for those completed part of my contributions in Launchpad soon.

 13:11 <Kilos> mIk3_08  if you can get someone in the forums you work with to write testimonials about your contributions , that will be a big help

 13:11 <mIk3_08> Bashing-om: you know me already. I know you already in your Fridge..

 13:12 <Kilos> mIk3_08  you applied before as well?

 13:12 <mapreri> Personally, not following the forum I have trouble understanding how to value those contributions.  I see you have about 1k posts and in the past month you have been somewhat active (I seem unable to get a longer history), but I can't really value the quality of those posts myself at this time.

 13:12 <mapreri> That's why testimonials are so important! :)

 13:13 <mIk3_08> Kilos testimonials are too early this time. as i mentioned earlier.  Yes. I already applied years back ago

 13:13 <mapreri> well, having testimonials after the membership is granted is not really useful, now is it ^^

 13:14 <Kilos> mIk3_08  maybe work with those guys till they are happy to write your testimonials

 13:14 <Kilos> I dont remember anyone getting membership without good testimonials

 13:14 <diddledani> I think we're all done with questions?

 13:15 <Wildmanne39> Yes diddledani

 13:15 <Kilos> ok

 13:15 <mapreri> y

 13:18 <Bashing-om> -1 As I do not see substantions for Ubuntu contributions - Short term contributions in support is not enough to justify membership.
