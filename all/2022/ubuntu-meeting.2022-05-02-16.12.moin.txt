 16:13 <ddstreet> #topic Current meeting chair

 16:13 <ddstreet> this hasn't been discussed for a while, but I think having only sil2100 on the list doesn't seem optimal; anyone else want to volunteer to be on the chairing rotation?

 16:14 <ddstreet> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/Agenda

 16:14 <ddstreet> for reference, the agenda i'm going thru

 16:14 <bdmurray> I would after a couple of more meetings

 16:14 <seb128> I will do aft... same

 16:14 <ddstreet> ok guess we can bring it up again at later mtg

 16:14 <ddstreet> i'll skip the long-term action items as we usually do

 16:15 <seb128> üëç

 16:16 <ddstreet> #subtopic sil2100 update application docs and possibly DMB checklist, to make sure candidates have signed CoC before applying and before DMB approves (carried over)

 16:16 <ddstreet> i assume this should be carried over, as he's not here

 16:16 <ddstreet> #action sil2100 update application docs and possibly DMB checklist, to make sure candidates have signed CoC before applying and before DMB approves (carried over)

 16:17 * meetingology teward follow up to get all application process wiki/docs to explain the process to be able to edit wiki pages, for applicants who don't yet have wiki edit access (carried over)

 16:17 <ddstreet> ok that's all the previous action items

 16:17 <ddstreet> the only application is from me, for a ubuntu-support-uploaders team

 16:18 <ddstreet> does the rest of the board want to consider that now or defer it to a meeting where more members are present?

 16:19 <bdmurray> Are there people currently interested  and ready to join that team?

 16:19 <ddstreet> yes

 16:19 <seb128> I think we can review it now, or at least start discussing it

 16:20 <ddstreet> i actually am trying to hand this application off to a colleague, but haven't done that just yet

 16:20 <ddstreet> ok let's do at least an initial discussions then

 16:20 <ddstreet> #topic ubuntu-support-uploaders team application

 16:21 <ddstreet> for clarification, this request is to create a new DMB-managed team that has upload rights for a new packageset

 16:21 <bdmurray> will this team have the ability to approve their own members?

 16:21 * bdmurray is reading https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers/TeamDelegation

 16:21 <ddstreet> initially, the only team member would be me (assuming i haven't passed this off to someone before its approved), and the initial first package is sosreport

 16:22 <ddstreet> bdmurray the DMB docs on this aren't exactly clear, at least to my reading, but no this would be a standard DMB-managed team that can't manage its own members; new members would need to apply to the DMB to join

 16:23 <bdmurray> okay

 16:23 <seb128> why do you feel like there is a need for a such team?

 16:24 <seb128> and who do you envision to be interested to join it?

 16:24 <ddstreet> so that the ACL for all the support team's packages is kept in a single packageset, so new members don't need to apply for PPU for a collection of packages

 16:25 <ddstreet> re: joiners, members of Canonical support and/or community members who support Ubuntu

 16:26 <ddstreet> i believe the setup would be very similar to the 'ubuntu-server' packageset, which is ACL'ed by the ~ubuntu-server-dev team

 16:26 <ddstreet> so anyone on the Canonical server team i suspect is familiar with that and understands the usefulness of the setup

 16:27 <bdmurray> For the server team I'd think its a stepping stone to core dev though.

 16:27 <ddstreet> seb128 if i understand the ~ubuntu-desktop team correctly (which has ACL to upload into the ubuntu-desktop packageset), that is different as far as managing its own members

 16:28 <ddstreet> bdmurray could be, though i don't think that's necessarily a goal for support members

 16:28 <seb128> I see the interest of creating a set, providing the content of the set has value to some people who aren't going to apply to more

 16:29 <seb128> I'm not really familiar with what the support team usually needs though, nor with sosreport

 16:29 <ddstreet> sosreport, systemtap, crash, gdb, etc

 16:30 <ddstreet> packageset additions would have to be approved by the DMB of course

 16:30 <ddstreet> initially it's only sosreport

 16:30 <seb128> right, I just foresee that to be of real use that set would need to include things like gdb and apport

 16:30 <bdmurray> Given that any changes, of people or packages, would be managed by the DMB I'm fine with creating this team.

 16:30 <seb128> which probably creates an higher contribution trust level than sosreport

 16:31 <ddstreet> seb128 absolutely, i just want to defer adding those packages until we can be sure we actually want/need upload rights for them

 16:31 <ddstreet> gdb, for example, generally hasn't really required us to upload fixes for it

 16:31 <ddstreet> even though we use it extensively

 16:31 <seb128> I feel like people doing those packages should probably aim for coredev

 16:32 <ddstreet> that might change in the future if/when debuginfod is implemented for ubuntu

 16:32 <seb128> doing uploads for*

 16:32 <ddstreet> seb128 why do you feel that? support's goal is very different and very far removed from devel release work

 16:32 <ddstreet> you may be viewing this from product engineering perspective

 16:33 <seb128> it's more that I see some of those components as key ubuntu packages, preinstalled

 16:33 <seb128> so I wouldn't hand upload right for those lightly

 16:33 <seb128> and to win the trust needed you would probably need significant uploads to Ubuntu

 16:33 <ddstreet> that seems more like a question of which specific packages should be in the packageset though, not if the packageset should be created in the first place?

 16:34 <seb128> right

 16:34 <ddstreet> if you haven't ever used sosreport, for example, do you think only coredevs should be able to upload that?

 16:34 <seb128> but the path leads me to wonder if the packageset is going to be of real use

 16:34 <seb128> no

 16:34 <ddstreet> crash likewise is heavily used by support, but i doubt if that really needs a coredev to upload it

 16:35 <seb128> right

 16:35 <ddstreet> in any case, the initial application only involves sosreport

 16:35 <seb128> I don't see an issue with creating that packageset

 16:35 <ddstreet> any more q from anyone?

 16:36 <ddstreet> since i'm applying for the packageset/team, i'll abstain from the voting

 16:36 <ddstreet> i would like to get things rolling before the next meeting though, is it ok with everyone here if I ask for a vote (and any further discussion) to happen on the ML?

 16:37 <seb128> that's ok with me

 16:37 <bdmurray> that's fine with me

 16:37 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet request discussion/voting on ubuntu-support-uploaders continue on ML

 16:37 * meetingology ddstreet request discussion/voting on ubuntu-support-uploaders continue on ML

 16:37 <ddstreet> ok thanks, i'll send an email to the list to follow up

 16:38 <seb128> just for clarification, my questions were basically aimed at getting a feeling on the value of a such set, but I've not been in the DMB long enough to really understand if that's something we should give consideration to

 16:38 <ddstreet> #topic open TB bugs

 16:39 <ddstreet> seb128 yep i understand, and i think the DMB might benefit from more defined docs to help new members (and old members!) understand what exactly the process and policies are

 16:39 <ddstreet> anyway, moving on

 16:39 <ddstreet> #subtopic fnordahl PPU

 16:39 <seb128> right, sorry for derailling thins :)

 16:39 <seb128> things

 16:39 <ddstreet> np :)

 16:39 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bug/1967795

 16:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1967795 in ubuntu-community "[TB/DMB] PPU for ~fnordahl" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 16:39 <ddstreet> look like this is done

 16:39 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 16:40 <ddstreet> #subtopic No single official source of DMB rules/procedures/policies, and KB wiki page is not complete or correct

 16:40 <ddstreet> I don't know if we want to discuss this here and/or in the ML

 16:40 <ddstreet> and this might just be my personal opinion

 16:41 <seb128> ML or another time

 16:41 <seb128> I need to wrap in a few minutes at least

 16:41 <ddstreet> #subtopic Suggestion (from ddstreet) to discontinue use of private DMB IRC channel, and keep all official communication public

 16:41 <ddstreet> this also is just a suggestion from me

 16:41 <ddstreet> no need to discuss now, if everyone needs to wrap

 16:41 <ddstreet> any comments before we end?

 16:42 <ddstreet> or any other AOB topics?

 16:42 <seb128> not from me

 16:42 <ddstreet> ok let's wrap, thanks everyone o/

 16:42 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
