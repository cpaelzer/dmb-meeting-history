 14:31 <cpaelzer> let us get going ...

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:32 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgraphics-colornames-perl/+bug/1982461

 14:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1982461 in libchart-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libgraphics-colornames-perl" [Undecided, New]

 14:32 <cpaelzer> waits for the cleanup and dmeotion

 14:32 <cpaelzer> but is ok

 14:33 <cpaelzer> pytohn-jsonschema is new

 14:33 <cpaelzer> needing python-uritemplate (which has an old MIR that cna not be used, it was abandoned)

 14:33 <sarnold> hooray, one new one shows up means an old one gets dropped

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and python-rfc3987 + webcolors

 14:34 <cpaelzer> this is now pulled in by openstack

 14:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: coreycb: ^^

 14:34 <jamespage> o/ - doing training as well but I'll try follow along

 14:35 <slyon> I will take care of the libchart-perl cleanup

 14:35 <cpaelzer> jamespage: coreycb: this is what we look to you for python-jsonschema -> python-uritemplate/python-rfc3987/webcolors

 14:35 <slyon> should demotion be an automatic process after it is dropped from the seed, or do I need to ping an AA?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> slyon: there are dmeotions listed, just a sec

 14:36 <cpaelzer> slyon: see https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html

 14:36 <cpaelzer> search for "... to universe"

 14:36 <cpaelzer> slyon: is yours listed there

 14:36 <cpaelzer> AA's clean up from there every now and then, but it needs to be there to check if all changes you did were done right and are in effect

 14:36 <sarnold> oh cool, I never knew how to read this page

 14:37 <slyon> nice, thanks

 14:37 <jamespage> cpaelzer: ack on those three - coreycb and I will review

 14:37 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:37 <cpaelzer> slyon: once it shows there as "movement to universe" ping ubuntu-archive in #ubuntu-release (or wait)

 14:37 <slyon> ack

 14:38 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:38 <cpaelzer> going on with the agenda

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:38 <cpaelzer> we just had colornames discussed

 14:38 <cpaelzer> slyon: I assume that libchart-perl also becomes not-needed by your change?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> if so, should we mark it Won't Fix as well?

 14:39 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes, I will drop libchart-perl from the seed

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok noted on the bug now

 14:39 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:39 <slyon> I wanted to mark it Fix Released from the seed package changelog.

 14:39 <cpaelzer> jigit goes on as well

 14:39 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jigit/+bug/1978066

 14:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1978066 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jigit" [Undecided, Confirmed]

 14:40 <slyon> I'm on top of jigit and we will drop the dependency as soon as patches are available

 14:40 <cpaelzer> slyon: is it pulled in from the seed or via a meta package - the former has no package/changelog you could use

 14:40 <slyon> I already talked to Alex about it

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok on jigit, that is just what I've read from the bug updates

 14:40 <cpaelzer> \o/

 14:40 <cpaelzer> queue LGTM then

 14:40 <slyon> cpaelzer: a indeed, it's the platform seed, so probably no package changelog

 14:40 <cpaelzer> yes no changelog there

 14:41 <cpaelzer> only if you change "Tasks" it would render into a meta package and even then it would ont fix the named package bug task

 14:41 <slyon> true. thanks for marking it wontfix

 14:41 <cpaelzer> assigning jigit to you then, to be out of the MIR teams radar

 14:41 <slyon> ack

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:41 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:42 <cpaelzer> on wildcards we agreed to ask debian and then continue the MIR on whatever theay are ok with

 14:42 <cpaelzer> if it stays wildcard it will need to add an autopkgtets

 14:42 <cpaelzer> if it swicthes to shellify then the MIR template has to be updated

 14:42 <cpaelzer> either way this makes progress

 14:43 <cpaelzer> regexp-ipv6 ...

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: you seem to be on this

 14:43 <slyon> regexp-ipv6 is currently waiting for Debian

 14:43 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:43 <slyon> we'll give them some more time. If it doesn't move, I'll intoduce a delta to change the deps back to status quo

 14:43 <cpaelzer> and vulcan got a security reviewer

 14:43 <sarnold> \o/

 14:43 <cpaelzer> \o/

 14:43 <cpaelzer> which gets us to

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:44 <sarnold> jigit was recently finished; the libwpe and wpebackend-fdo packages are well in progress (but I believe the testing story needs help); iwd is well in progress

 14:44 <cpaelzer> that is progress, thanks sarnold

 14:45 <slyon> thanks sarnold \o/

 14:45 <sarnold> good news recently about vulkan being picked up :) but I haven't started gsasl yet, and afaik chris hasn't started in on nullboot yet :(

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I marked ipmitool as important two weeks ago, found any resources to look at that?

 14:45 <sarnold> no, sorry

 14:45 <cpaelzer> that was when we discussed how to mark things urgent :-)

 14:46 <sarnold> I believe mark esler has shown an interest in starting it, but I'm not sure if he's been resourced for it or not

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I'm glad that things get resolved and won't complain too much about a particular one yet

 14:46 <sarnold> (our managers are off for the moment to recover from the sprint)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I was off as well, but didn't get more than one extra day

 14:46 <sarnold> :(

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I think we are good here

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thank sarnold for the updates

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:47 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:47 <slyon> nothing

 14:47 <didrocks> nothing for me either

 14:47 <cpaelzer> slyon: did you have any first look at mdevctl yet, any chaos on our new rules?

 14:47 <cpaelzer> no other topic from me

 14:47 <slyon> cpaelzer: I didn't find the time to work on that yet (only skimmed through briefly)

 14:47 <cpaelzer> fine

 14:48 <cpaelzer> then I'll call this meeting over

 14:48 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:48 <slyon> but it will hopefully be done by next meeting

 14:48 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 14:48 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
