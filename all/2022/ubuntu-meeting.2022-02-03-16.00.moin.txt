 16:13 <sergiodj> doko: I'm working on a tentative fix for llvm-toolchain-12

 16:13 <sergiodj> re. ocaml transition

 16:13 <sergiodj> I'm running autopkgtests now

 16:13 <doko> sergiodj, fixing what?

 16:13 <sergiodj> doko: the llvm-toolchain-12 failure

 16:13 <doko> it is fixed

 16:14 <kanashiro> I also did some test retriggers to try to unblock ocaml, it is blocking ruby-defaults right now

 16:14 <sergiodj> doko: where?

 16:14 <doko> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-toolchain-12/1:12.0.1-19ubuntu1

 16:14 <sergiodj> doesn't seem to fix the problem: https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/l/llvm-toolchain-12/jammy/amd64

 16:15 <bdmurray> Can the llvm conversation move to #ubuntu-devel? Thanks

 16:15 <bdmurray> bug 1958720

 16:15 <ubottu> Bug 1958720 in pyyaml (Ubuntu) "python3-yaml and python3-six are not co-installable with python-is-python2 in jammy" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1958720

 16:15 <sergiodj> sure

 16:16 <bdmurray> It looks like the server team will take that

 16:16 <bdmurray> bug 1959458

 16:16 <ubottu> Bug 1959458 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Lock screen disabling needs updating" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1959458

 16:16 <bdmurray> I did an upgrade recently and the screen became locked which isn't supposed to happen

 16:16 <bdmurray> This might be good for enr0n since they are looking at u-r-u now

 16:17 <bdmurray> So let's card and tag that

 16:17 <bdmurray> I mean target not tag

 16:17 <bdmurray> bug 1959362

 16:17 <ubottu> Bug 1959362 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "'Launch using dedicated graphics card' option absent (nvidia, proprietary drivers, on-demand PRIME mode)" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1959362

 16:18 <bdmurray> That's assigned to seb so let's leave it be

 16:18 <bdmurray> bug 1948714 the reporter got back to me

 16:19 <ubottu> Bug 1948714 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "After reboot, the password set at install time doesn't work." [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1948714

 16:19 <bdmurray> and they used a cute password "Thanks#Brian"

 16:19 <bdmurray> which registed as Thanks/Brian so it does sound like sil2100's bug

 16:20 <bdmurray> agreed?

 16:20 <sil2100> Yes, indeed, looks like a duplicate of that

 16:20 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll mark it as such

 16:20 <sil2100> Might need to get back to it eventually - at least now they can check the password as a workaround!

 16:21 <bdmurray> I guess we should release note using the "eye" then

 16:21 <sil2100> The other bug is carded and 'in progress-ish', so all good

 16:22 <bdmurray> rls-ii is empty

 16:22 <bdmurray> and so is rls-ff

 16:22 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:22 <jawn-smith> Let's focus on python3-defaults

 16:23 <schopin> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:23 <ahasenack> I'm working on python-fysom, python-furl

 16:23 <jawn-smith> aiocoap was xypron, which you said needs sponsoring, correct?

 16:23 <ahasenack> and possibly other of the same class, which is "cannot import name 'MutableMapping' from 'collections' "

 16:23 <ahasenack> a change in py3.10

 16:23 <xypron> jawn-smith: yes

 16:24 <bdmurray> ahasenack: did you try searching the logs for that error?

 16:24 <schopin> jawn-smith: aiocoap was sponsored though.

 16:24 <jawn-smith> excellent. xypron: keras?

 16:24 <ahasenack> bdmurray: not yet, first two python packages I grabbed had the same, so I'm calling it a class already

 16:24 <xypron> jawn-smith: aiocoap - autopkgtest fixed in proposed LP: #1959315

 16:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1959315 in aiocoap (Ubuntu) "autopackage tests fail" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1959315

 16:24 <jawn-smith> excellent thanks

 16:24 <bdmurray> it might just need retrying

 16:24 <xypron> ok I will look into keras

 16:24 <ahasenack> bdmurray: my case? It needed a fix from upstream

 16:25 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: kleborate?

 16:25 <ginggs> xypron: did you see https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html#aiocoap still fails?

 16:25 <bdmurray> it being aiocoap

 16:25 <jawn-smith> ansible is me and ahasenack still

 16:25 <ahasenack> my problem with ansible is this:

 16:25 <ahasenack> $ sudo py3compile -p ansible

 16:25 <ahasenack> [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/ansible/module_utils/ansible_release.py'

 16:26 <ahasenack> any new build produces that broken symlink

 16:26 <ahasenack> $ dpkg -L ansible|grep ansible_release\\.py

 16:26 <ahasenack> er

 16:26 <ahasenack> $ dpkg -L ansible|grep ansible_release\\.py

 16:26 <jawn-smith> ahasenack: Indeed, I've seen that one too. Let's tag up about it after this meeting

 16:26 <ahasenack> /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/module_utils/ansible_release.py

 16:26 <ahasenack> /usr/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/ansible/module_utils/ansible_release.py

 16:26 <ahasenack> the python3.10 symlink is broken

 16:26 <ahasenack> and is new, the current jammy build has just the python3 one (first line)

 16:26 <ahasenack> ok

 16:27 <jawn-smith> booth: sil2100

 16:27 <jawn-smith> should that stay with you?

 16:28 <sil2100> Yes, I didn't manage to look yet

 16:28 <sil2100> Let me actually create a card this time!

 16:28 <jawn-smith> bpython is schopin

 16:28 <schopin> just a matter of retrying, in the queue rn.

 16:28 <jawn-smith> looks like we may have skipped breezy last time. who wants it?

 16:29 <waveform> ccdproc just needs someone to bash the retry button as 2.30 in proposed fixes the issue (at least on arm64), so I can take another

 16:29 <schopin> I'll take breezy.

 16:29 <jawn-smith> waveform: remind me after this meeting to bash that button :)

 16:30 <jawn-smith> juliank: djangorestframework

 16:30 * juliank needs to add a reminder

 16:30 <jawn-smith> freezegun is ogayot

 16:31 <ogayot> currently, I unsubscribed sponsors because there's a new version in proposed migration that should land soon

 16:31 <jawn-smith> does it need any test retries or anything?

 16:31 <ogayot> tests are still in progress, so currently no

 16:31 <jawn-smith> okay great

 16:31 <slyon> waveform: jawn-smith: I kicked ccdproc

 16:31 <jawn-smith> gitsome was alexghiti

 16:31 <jawn-smith> slyon: thanks!

 16:32 <alexghiti5> gitsome was uploaded already

 16:32 <slyon> gitsome was sponsored... probably needs retry vs python3-defaults

 16:32 <jawn-smith> alright, noted another button to bash

 16:32 <jawn-smith> schopin: you said you were working on hy?

 16:33 <schopin> yeah

 16:33 <jawn-smith> excellent, thanks

 16:33 <jawn-smith> who doesn't have one?

 16:33 <dbungert> I need one

 16:33 <alexghiti5> I don't

 16:33 <jawn-smith> dbungert: lazygal?

 16:33 <slyon> alexghiti5: I kicked gitsome

 16:33 <slyon> jawn-smith: also, I don't have one

 16:33 <waveform> I don't have one

 16:33 <dbungert> jawn-smith: ack

 16:34 <jawn-smith> alexghiti5: libapache2-mod-python?

 16:34 <alexghiti5> slyon thanks, this is the same error as before my patch so that should be ok

 16:34 <jawn-smith> slyon: link-grammar?

 16:34 <slyon> ack

 16:34 <alexghiti5> jawn-smith: ack

 16:34 <jawn-smith> waveform: mando?

 16:34 <waveform> jawn-smith, ack

 16:34 <jawn-smith> I believe mailman3 is with mwhudson right?

 16:34 <jawn-smith> that's why I skipped that one

 16:34 <bdmurray> that's my recollection

 16:34 <ogayot> I can pick one as well

 16:34 <jawn-smith> also lefse may just need a test retry as it's only s390x

 16:34 <jawn-smith> ogayot: mosquitto?

 16:35 <ogayot> ack

 16:35 <ginggs> lefse might need a hint

 16:35 <jawn-smith> I'll check on lefse

 16:35 <enr0n> I can take one

 16:35 <jawn-smith> enr0n: nanolyse?

 16:35 <enr0n> Sure

 16:35 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: openmotor?

 16:35 <bdmurray> okay

 16:35 <jawn-smith> I think that's everyone

 16:36 <jawn-smith> If you finish yours quickly please feel free to take another :)

 16:37 <jawn-smith> oh doko: do you have bandwidth to take one?

 16:38 <doko> sure

 16:38 <jawn-smith> how about pcapy?

 16:38 <bdmurray> what happend to onnx

 16:38 <jawn-smith> reading is hard, that's what happened

 16:39 <doko> ok

 16:39 <jawn-smith> doko how about onnx then?

 16:39 <jawn-smith> up to you

 16:39 <doko> ok

 16:39 <slyon> waveform: ccdproc is still failing

 16:39 <waveform> slyon, okay -- I'll take another look

 16:39 <jawn-smith> then ginggs can take pcapy?

 16:40 <ginggs> sure

 16:40 <jawn-smith> okay now I think that's everyone

 16:40 <jawn-smith> back to you bdmurray

 16:40 <bdmurray> okay, thanks jawn-smith

 16:40 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:41 <bdmurray> Anything else?

 16:41 <bdmurray> Remember Feature Freeze is coming

 16:42 <schopin> Oh I have something

 16:42 <schopin> src:rustc currently embeds a copy of LLVM.

 16:42 <ahasenack> wat

 16:43 <schopin> It is splittable (Debian does it), but rustc will likely be upgraded during the lifetime of our LTS because of Firefox

 16:44 <schopin> which likely means bumped LLVM requirements.

 16:45 <schopin> I don't know if adding new versions of LLVM in the archive during its lifetime is feasible? And if so, should we remove the previous extra ones once we introduce new ones?

 16:45 <bdmurray> Is there a question here?

 16:45 <doko> talk with mwhudson abour rustc

 16:45 <bdmurray> +1

 16:45 <schopin> it's not just about rustc though!

 16:47 <bdmurray> We'll have this discussion somewhere else.

 16:47 <bdmurray> Thanks everybody.
