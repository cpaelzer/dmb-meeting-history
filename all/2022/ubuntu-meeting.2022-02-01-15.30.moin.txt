 15:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:30:22 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:30 <cpaelzer> ping slyon, didrocks, sarnold, joalif, jamespage for MIR meeting

 15:30 <didrocks> hey

 15:30 <joalif> o/

 15:30 <jamespage> o/

 15:30 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:30 <cpaelzer> last week we landed a few wiki updates (done)

 15:30 <cpaelzer> adn we assigned a few MIR reviews

 15:31 <cpaelzer> I've just seen didrocks complete his a few hours ago

 15:31 <cpaelzer> and I did mine last wednesday

 15:31 <didrocks> *many* hours ago, hem hem :)

 15:31 <slyon> o/

 15:31 <cpaelzer> IIRC there was one more for joalif with guidance by jamespage if needed - did that complete as well?

 15:31 <joalif> I'm working on mine, i'm about to finish it

 15:31 <slyon> I completed mine as well (set to incomplete)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> and we had something I forgot assigned to slyon, maybe not a review - /me checks logs

 15:31 <cpaelzer> ah ok

 15:31 <cpaelzer> great then

 15:31 <cpaelzer> so notihng toally stuck and forgotten

 15:32 <cpaelzer> great

 15:32 <cpaelzer> let us look at this weeks news then

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <sarnold> good morning

 15:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> non-proposed looks like all-known

 15:33 <cpaelzer> libreoffice-epiphany sounds familiar, but not of recently

 15:33 <cpaelzer> didrocks: thinse LO is desktop, do you remember?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> s/thinse/since/

 15:34 <didrocks> I don’t remember we had it on the list, I’ll look at it

 15:34 <cpaelzer> wanted to write "that" and changed my mind to 2since" => thinse :-)

 15:34 <cpaelzer> thanks for having a look

 15:34 <cpaelzer> the rest is mostly known

 15:34 <cpaelzer> mesa/postgresql-14 -> llvm-toolchain-13 really "just" waits for promotion of llvm-toolchain-13

 15:34 <slyon> ack

 15:34 <cpaelzer> mclemenceau:  has asked doko to have a look

 15:35 <cpaelzer> but nothing happened for quite a while, probably busy by many other things

 15:35 <cpaelzer> slyon: do you know if doko is available enough these days to rely on him, or should we make his life easier asking another AA to promote it?

 15:36 <slyon> he is only available a few days a week, so if it just needs promotion, we might need another AA to move it forward quicker

 15:36 <slyon> s/might need/might ask/

 15:36 <cpaelzer> foundations agrees to own it and IIRC they subscribed

 15:36 <cpaelzer> let me check

 15:37 <slyon> yes we agreed to own LLVM. but apparently the llvm-toolchain-13 package is not yet subscribed :-/

 15:37 <cpaelzer> foundations-bugs is not yet subscribed AFAICS

 15:37 <cpaelzer> so not "just promoting it"

 15:38 <slyon> let me check back with doko then during our next team meeting

 15:38 <cpaelzer> you already do the work and maintenance, we just need to correct the subscription and then promote it

 15:38 <cpaelzer> no need for a complex case, but it would unblock a lot of rather complex things in -proposed

 15:38 <cpaelzer> so I'd like to give this a  +1 in prio

 15:38 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon for carrying it to the team

 15:39 <cpaelzer> doesn't have to be doko to handle it AFAICT

 15:39 <cpaelzer> ok, enough of mismatches for today

 15:39 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:39 <sarnold> python-vitrage?

 15:39 <cpaelzer> sarnold: while new it has a bug assigned per the color

 15:39 <jamespage> I'll take that its openstack related

 15:39 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage

 15:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-archive/+bug/1893935

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1893935 in python-vitrageclient (Ubuntu Jammy) "[MIR] python3-vitrageclient" [High, Triaged]

 15:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/twitter-bootstrap3/+bug/1667150

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1667150 in twitter-bootstrap3 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] twitter-bootstrap3" [High, Won't Fix]

 15:40 <slyon> that was marked wontfix in 2019..

 15:40 <sarnold> comment #9 suggests the JS is just for docs

 15:40 <cpaelzer> the latter can be painful doing much more than needed in one package and having plenty of dependencies (from my look at it for mailman3 back in the day)

 15:40 <sarnold> I don't know how we mark those

 15:40 <jamespage> it will be

 15:40 <cpaelzer> so be careful when reviewing those jamespage

 15:41 <cpaelzer> maybe you can cut twitter-bootstrap3 and only need the python-vitrageclient

 15:41 <cpaelzer> should be much easier overall

 15:41 <jamespage> ack

 15:41 <cpaelzer> ok, trying again to go on with the agenda :-) Thanks for bringing it up though - was worth the discussion

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:42 <cpaelzer> "only one bug" but a complex one and two tasks

 15:42 <cpaelzer> step #1 - I'd suggest we do assign two people (one per task) to split the load

 15:42 <cpaelzer> anyone feeling less than 1255 busy these days that could have a look?

 15:42 <cpaelzer> 125%

 15:43 <didrocks> I am 214% this week (approximately), but if this can wait another week, I’m happy reviewing something like cargo

 15:43 <didrocks> well, by some definition of "happy" :)

 15:44 <cpaelzer> there are quite some "TODO" left open in the bug description

 15:44 <cpaelzer> are we sure this is even meant to be ready for review?

 15:44 <joalif> same for me, however I am happy to review whatever (right now I cannot judge the complexity of a review )

 15:45 <slyon> I've been told its ready. I think the mwhudson opinion has been clarified in the comments and an autopkgtest has been proposed in Debian

 15:45 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:45 <cpaelzer> I do not really see the time either, but since I'm involved in drafting the rust rules I'll take rustc

 15:45 <didrocks> agreed that description should be updated first to address/remove TODOs

 15:45 <cpaelzer> but for cargo at least I'd want someone else to do it

 15:46 <sarnold> hmm, he mentions devendoring llvm.. I thought the rust folks had pretty significant changes in their llvm

 15:46 <cpaelzer> schopin: could you carry https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cargo/+bug/1957932/comments/1 into an update of the bug description please?

 15:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1957932 in rustc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] rustc, cargo" [Critical, New]

 15:48 <cpaelzer> I think for rustc I'm gonna do a first level reivew asking for detailed plans on llvm but also things like dh-cargo and others that came up while drafting the MIR rules for it

 15:48 <cpaelzer> looking for a cargo volunteer

 15:49 <cpaelzer> If no one says yes it will be didrocks with the acknowledgement to do it next week and a big credit for next "looking for volunteers" round :-)

 15:49 <sarnold> hehe

 15:49 <cpaelzer> ok that will be it

 15:49 <didrocks> (beers in Franfurt :p)

 15:49 <cpaelzer> we have to get through our content to not miss other bits ...

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:49 <cpaelzer> Mission: discuss the recent activity to identify any follow up action

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:50 <cpaelzer> I have pinged ahasenack on FRR, thanks didrocks for the review

 15:50 <didrocks> yw!

 15:50 <cpaelzer> Since it was a security-team request to please change quagga->frr I hope we can still get a fast-pass on an security ack

 15:51 <cpaelzer> the other things you asked on the bug seem fine and ahasenack is great at resolving those

 15:51 <cpaelzer> everything else is older

 15:51 <cpaelzer> v4l2-relayd

 15:51 <slyon> that one is back to the reporter

 15:52 <cpaelzer> oh I see, long list of todos

 15:52 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:52 <slyon> I assembled a list of TODOs that needs improvement

 15:52 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:52 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:52 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:52 <cpaelzer> sarnold: any news that will raise our mood on this?

 15:53 <sarnold> only slightly, python-cheroot is still in progress, no progress on adsys

 15:53 <cpaelzer> I see foundations and Desktop have updated their deadlines/milestones

 15:53 <slyon> \o/

 15:53 <cpaelzer> 10 Packages (+FRR/libyang2 that we know of + potentially a bit more over the next few weeks)

 15:53 <sarnold> having these milestones, and the launchpad config to see them :), is pretty fantastic

 15:54 <slyon> yeah... the Rust/Cargo MIR is one of them..

 15:54 <slyon> (once assigned to security)

 15:54 <cpaelzer> if we look at feature freeze or even beta that means from now on we will need like 3-4 per week done to go on

 15:54 <cpaelzer> just to size the focus and priority correctly

 15:54 <cpaelzer> @sarnold

 15:55 <sarnold> well, I *was* feeling optimstic..

 15:55 <cpaelzer> or you shut down security for a week at the last possible time and all do just reviews - but then no time is left, so no findings allowed :-)

 15:56 <cpaelzer> Please be optimistic, but I just wanted to make clear what velocity you need to get it done - so you can scream for more people in the team meetings that you have

 15:56 <cpaelzer> and by that we get to

 15:56 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:56 <sarnold> nothing from me

 15:56 <cpaelzer> nothing from me

 15:56 <joalif> nothing

 15:56 <didrocks> nothing either

 15:56 <slyon> nothing here

 15:57 <cpaelzer> ok then, closing for today ... just in time

 15:57 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:57 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
