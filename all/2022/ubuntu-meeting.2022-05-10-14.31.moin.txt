 14:31 <slyon> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:31 <slyon> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:31 <slyon> we'd didn't have any formal action items last week.

 14:31 <slyon> but how is the nullboot MIR progressing, joalif ?

 14:32 <joalif> slyon: just pasted my review, it's ok but needs security review

 14:32 <slyon> nice, thank you!

 14:32 <sarnold> good morning

 14:32 <slyon> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <slyon> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:33 <slyon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <slyon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <slyon> non-proposed looks rather clean. I created a stub bug for z3, which is in foundation's backlog

 14:33 <sarnold> requests -> python-charset-normalizer feels new

 14:34 <slyon> sarnold: ACK. we had it last week.

 14:34 <sarnold> licensecheck -> libobject-pad-perl feels new too

 14:34 <sarnold> d'oh

 14:34 <slyon> its shared duty between foundations and server, I might find some time to investigate that, or maybe cpaelzer can.

 14:35 <slyon> wrt licensecheck -> lib*-perl and sphinx -> lib*-perl:

 14:35 <slyon> i investigated that. its the usual start of new cycle pulling in of new -perl dependencies.

 14:35 <slyon> but all are maintained by Debians perl team and usually in a good shape

 14:35 <slyon> I created a (combined) stub bug report about it, so maybe we can handle them all at once

 14:36 <sarnold> nice nice

 14:37 <slyon> I also had a look at mutt vs gsasl. The SASL library was changed due to a licensing conflict and I'm currently consulting the team of what would be the best way forward. Most probably we need to MIR gsasl in addition to the existing SASL library

 14:37 <slyon> ruby-xmlrpc vs ruby-webrick is server, so maybe cpaelzer can investigate once he's back

 14:37 <sarnold> the licenses, they give, they take

 14:38 <slyon> jaraco.text vs jaraco.context is openstack, so for jamespage to have a look at

 14:38 <sarnold> I'm surprised ruby-xmlrpc is in main, but in focal libruby2.7 drags it around to everything..

 14:38 <slyon> sarnold: yeah... initially I just wanted to revert that change, but after some consultation this doesn't sound like a good idea.

 14:39 <slyon> we also have gvfs vs libsoup3 – didrocks did you have a chance to investigate that?

 14:39 <didrocks> slyon: it’s a real one, soname transition. However libsoup3 depends on sysprof right now which is uneeded

 14:39 <didrocks> so, the goal is for jbicha to fix this in Debian

 14:40 <didrocks> (assigned to him)

 14:40 <slyon> ok nice!

 14:40 <didrocks> I guess status is correct, no? there is a MIR bug, set as incomplete and assigned

 14:40 <didrocks> oh interesting, it’s not picked up

 14:40 <slyon> it doesn't show up in the report... did you subscribe ~ubuntu-mir ?

 14:40 <didrocks> I will check

 14:40 <slyon> thanks

 14:41 <didrocks> I thought I did, but maybe not clicked strongly enough :)

 14:41 <slyon> hehe

 14:41 <sarnold> hehehe

 14:41 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 14:41 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:41 <slyon> we have a bunch of new MIRs for review

 14:41 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:42 <slyon> bug 1971739

 14:42 <ubottu> Bug 1971739 in iwd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] iwd" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1971739

 14:42 <didrocks> I guess I can’t hide from gnome-text-editor. I can try taking iwd as well

 14:42 <slyon> I'd volunteer to do the iwd review, as I've been involved with that transition a bit

 14:43 <slyon> ok. didrocks: gnome-text-editor

 14:43 <slyon> slyon: iwd

 14:43 <didrocks> oh, forget I told that, feel free to tak iwd :p

 14:43 <slyon> joalif: do you have capacity to take one as well?

 14:43 <joalif> i can take the libfreeaptx or the other one

 14:43 <joalif> i don't mind

 14:44 <slyon> ok joalif: libfreeaptx

 14:44 <slyon> and I guess we'll leave ell for cpaelzer

 14:44 <slyon> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:44 <didrocks> sounds good, if he can’t, I will take it next week

 14:44 <didrocks> I see seb is spamming us with MIRs :p

 14:44 <slyon> thank you!

 14:44 <slyon> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:45 <slyon> All I see here are my lib*-perl stub bug reports.

 14:45 <slyon> And libqtr-glib; didrocks did you find some time to look at that?

 14:46 <didrocks> sorry, I missed that one, will do this week

 14:46 <slyon> thank you

 14:46 <didrocks> my goal is to ping seb/jbicha to get news

 14:46 <didrocks> but they were in the sprint

 14:46 <didrocks> so… hard :)

 14:46 <slyon> yes that'd be great

 14:47 <sarnold> :)

 14:47 <slyon> indeed

 14:47 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:47 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:47 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <slyon> I see no changes here.

 14:47 <sarnold> I started in on telegraf last night and I've got some panics that are stopping the build

 14:47 <slyon> do you have any news for us sarnold ?

 14:48 <sarnold> I haven't invested yet, it failed over night :( I'll probably need help if these are in the tests, as I think at the moment

 14:48 <sarnold> ok      github.com/influxdata/telegraf/plugins/outputs/influxdb_v2      0.020s

 14:48 <sarnold> panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

 14:48 <sarnold> [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x18 pc=0x971eb1]

 14:48 <sarnold> etc

 14:49 <slyon> ok. I think it would be best to reach out to sergiodj directly if you have any questions about that

 14:49 <sarnold> thanks

 14:49 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 14:49 <sarnold> none here

 14:49 <didrocks> nothing for me

 14:49 <joalif> none

 14:50 <slyon> cool, I'll assign the new MIRs to us as agreed upon above

 14:50 <slyon> other than that, we're done :)

 14:50 <slyon> #endmeeting
