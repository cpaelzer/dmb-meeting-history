 16:01 <jawn-smith> #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team

 16:01 <meetingology> Meeting started at 16:01:20 UTC.  The chair is jawn-smith.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 16:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:01 <jawn-smith> The weekly status is here:

 16:01 <jawn-smith> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-10-november-2022/32153

 16:02 <jawn-smith> Let's all take our usual few minutes to read and ask questions

 16:03 <jawn-smith> waveform: Are you on the DMB calendar yet?

 16:03 <waveform> I believe so, added myself at some point this week

 16:03 <jawn-smith> Yep I see you

 16:06 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:07 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:07 <jawn-smith> Just one

 16:07 <jawn-smith> bug 1842439

 16:07 <jawn-smith> Which is a purple link for me, so we must have discussed this already

 16:09 <bdrung> I talked to the desktop team last week and robert-ancell developed a patch, but that is not enough. So still waiting for the desktop team.

 16:09 <jawn-smith> Okay thanks, moving on then

 16:09 <jawn-smith> https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:09 <jawn-smith> bug 1965094

 16:10 <jawn-smith> This one also appears to be with desktop

 16:10 <jawn-smith> bug 1993037

 16:13 <jawn-smith> Asking for more information in the bug report

 16:13 <jawn-smith> That's it for rls incoming bugs

 16:14 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/foundations-triage-discuss-bug-tasks.html

 16:15 <jawn-smith> Lots of discussion about our bug triage process

 16:16 <jawn-smith> bug 1993318

 16:18 <jawn-smith> We disabled this in the kinetic ISOs

 16:18 <jawn-smith> ZFS + encryption is no longer an install option

 16:19 <jawn-smith> so marking invalid and removing the tag

 16:19 <enr0n> I'll mark invalid for systemd and remove the tag

 16:19 <jawn-smith> bug 1968109

 16:20 <jawn-smith> juliank: you tagged this one

 16:20 <jawn-smith> My opinion is that this sounds like an issue for the flavors

 16:21 <jawn-smith> Removing the tags

 16:22 <jawn-smith> bug 1983522

 16:22 <jawn-smith> This seems like it would come up in proposed migration

 16:23 * jawn-smith checks the proposed migration report

 16:23 <bdrung> IMO we should put this ticket on our queue (tag foundations-todo)

 16:23 <jawn-smith> Yes cryptsetup is in the proposed migration report

 16:23 <jawn-smith> Sounds good to me, bdrung do you mind doing that?

 16:24 <bdrung> Yes, I'll tag it

 16:24 <jawn-smith> skipping the rustc one as our rustc person is on holiday

 16:24 <jawn-smith> bug 1579457

 16:25 <juliank> jftr: (queue ~ subscribe foundations-bugs, foundations-todo ~ selected for development)

 16:27 <adrien> doesn't sharing swap between OS means you could boot into another OS with the same swap?

 16:29 <dbungert> I'll add some comments to the bug

 16:30 <jawn-smith> bug 1981103

 16:31 <jawn-smith> slyon to update the bug

 16:31 <slyon> ifupdown is in universe, so we should remove the tag and ask for a patch

 16:31 <jawn-smith> bug 1988018

 16:31 <jawn-smith> Waiting on the openstack team

 16:32 <jawn-smith> so removing the discuss tag

 16:32 <jawn-smith> bug 1988423

 16:33 <jawn-smith> Brian tagged this and he's not here, so let's discuss this one later

 16:34 <jawn-smith> bug 1994165

 16:34 <jawn-smith> adrien: Do you think this is worth an SRU?

 16:35 <jawn-smith> This should be fixed in lunar by merging/syncing openssl from Debian

 16:35 <jawn-smith> but is a patch worth SRU-ing to kinetic/jammy? Not sure the importance here

 16:36 <jawn-smith> adrien to have a look at this bug and update the bug report at that time

 16:37 <jawn-smith> Plenty more bugs in the list, but with 15 minutes left in the meeting let's pivot to proposed-migration

 16:37 <jawn-smith> #topic proposed-migration

 16:37 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:37 <adrien> there's maybe more discussion in the openssl bug report about the CLA than the actual issue :P

 16:39 <jawn-smith> Many of these regressions are on a single arch, so should just be retried

 16:39 <jawn-smith> However, we're not going to retrigger a bunch of tests right now as the queues are still hefty from archive opening

 16:39 * jawn-smith looks for regressions on multiple arches to hand out

 16:39 <bdrung> some package (e.g. apport) failed with badpkg

 16:40 <jawn-smith> apport has a regression on multiple arches

 16:40 <jawn-smith> bdrung: can you look into this badpkg issue?

 16:42 <jawn-smith> cmake has failures on multiple arches

 16:42 <jawn-smith> any volunteers for cmake?

 16:43 <jawn-smith> ogayot: cmake?

 16:43 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 16:43 <ogayot> ack

 16:44 <jawn-smith> dbus will be handled by a merge from waveform

 16:44 <jawn-smith> so skipping those

 16:44 <jawn-smith> distro-info

 16:44 <waveform> ack

 16:44 <jawn-smith> Anyone want it?

 16:44 <enr0n> Isn't that bdrung's package?

 16:44 <bdrung> regarding badpkg for apport: dbus-x11 1.14.0-2ubuntu2 cannot go with libdbus-1-3 (= 1.14.0-2ubuntu3)

 16:45 <jawn-smith> waveform: distro-info

 16:46 <jawn-smith> libselinux has a few failures on multiple architectures

 16:46 <waveform> ack again :)

 16:46 <jawn-smith> ignoring dbus

 16:47 <jawn-smith> glib2.0 vs libselinux, any takers?

 16:47 <jawn-smith> Oh that's the dbus issue

 16:48 <jawn-smith> I'll take nemo vs libselinux

 16:48 <slyon> it seems to be the same dbus-x11 failure for glib

 16:48 <jawn-smith> how about network-manager vs libselinux?

 16:48 <jawn-smith> Any takers?

 16:49 <jawn-smith> danilogondolfo: network-manager vs libselinux with support from another team member

 16:49 <bdrung> The sbuild autopkgtest fails because debootstrap did not know lunar yet. So retriggering the test.

 16:50 <jawn-smith> Okay, we're running short on time. Let's let the queues settle for now and move to AOB

 16:50 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 16:50 <jawn-smith> Tomorrow is a US holiday

 16:51 <ogayot> also a holiday in France

 16:51 <enr0n> I will be out Monday also

 16:53 <slyon> danilogondolfo: actually the libselinux vs networkmanager seems to be related to dbus-x11 badpkg as well...

 16:54 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
