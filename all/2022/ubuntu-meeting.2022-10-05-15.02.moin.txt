 15:06 <ddstreet> hopefully they are less busy over the fall/winter

 15:07 <ddstreet> assumed carry over for that too

 15:07 <mapreri> yap

 15:07 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 15:07 <mapreri> uh, this I actually forgot

 15:07 <ddstreet> lol thats ok :)

 15:08 <ddstreet> should we carry it?

 15:08 <ddstreet> or drop it?

 15:08 <mapreri> but I now too time has passed, need to look what the thing was again

 15:08 <mapreri> please leave it

 15:08 <ddstreet> ok

 15:08 <ddstreet> #action mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 15:08 * meetingology mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 15:08 <mapreri> If it's there probably there was a good reason from past me

 15:08 <ddstreet> there's a bug associated, lemme at least link that for reference

 15:08 <mapreri> don't worry, I'll find it

 15:08 <ddstreet> ok

 15:08 <ddstreet> that's all previous action items

 15:09 <ddstreet> #topic open mailing list threads

 15:09 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:09 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022680.html

 15:09 <ddstreet> i think we can carry this over too

 15:09 <mapreri> checked, still in inbox

 15:09 <ddstreet> #action clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:09 * meetingology clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 15:10 <ddstreet> #subtopic charter/policies

 15:10 <mapreri> (I also found in inbox the thread about dh-python, fwiw)

 15:10 <ddstreet> thanks for reviewing charter/policies! i just saw your email

 15:10 <ddstreet> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-October/022945.html

 15:10 <ddstreet> for reference

 15:11 <mapreri> yeah, of course I send such emails right before the meeting, what did you expect? :P

 15:11 <ddstreet> on quick read of your comments, the changes sound fine to me

 15:11 <ddstreet> lol

 15:11 <ddstreet> instead of trying to modify it now and re-review, i can update it after the meeting and send another email, and we can defer the vote to next meeting

 15:11 <ddstreet> if that sounds ok to you?

 15:12 <mapreri> sounds good.

 15:12 <mapreri> just checking

 15:12 <mapreri> electing the chair: super or simple majority?

 15:12 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet update charter/policies from mapreri review email, send new email asking for review again

 15:12 * meetingology ddstreet update charter/policies from mapreri review email, send new email asking for review again

 15:13 <ddstreet> i'm fine with either way, i think

 15:13 <mapreri> I also don't have a strong opinion on that one myself

 15:13 <mapreri> if you think simple may be easier, go with that (in my mail I wrote super)

 15:13 <ddstreet> i think i lean to just a simple majority

 15:14 <ddstreet> yeah, a simple majority for both appoint/approving, as well as removal, is probably best i think

 15:15 <mapreri> ack

 15:15 <ddstreet> ok i'll update the policies to state simple majority for chair add/remove

 15:15 <mapreri> â€¦charter?

 15:15 <ddstreet> and we can tweak that pretty easy before the vote if we change our mind

 15:15 <ddstreet> oh charter right sorry

 15:15 <mapreri> good :)

 15:15 <ddstreet> yeah the charter currently says 'see the policies' but i agree it's easier to reduce cross-referencings

 15:15 <mapreri> next topic

 15:15 <mapreri> also, the policies don't say :P

 15:16 <ddstreet> yeah, clearly an oversight :)

 15:16 <ddstreet> i mean...i was testing you! lol

 15:16 <mapreri> :>

 15:16 <ddstreet> ok that's all ml threads

 15:16 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs

 15:16 <mapreri> I haven't kept up with the current bugs in the past month

 15:17 <mapreri> but looking at them now, I see it's the same set of open bugs from a month ago, soâ€¦

 15:17 <ddstreet> yep, one waiting on an upload

 15:17 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+source/limnoria/+bug/1983415

 15:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1983415 in limnoria (Ubuntu Jammy) "[BPO] limnoria 2022.6.23-1 to jammy" [Undecided, New]

 15:17 <ddstreet> oh wait i think someone did upload that

 15:17 <mapreri> I *believe* that's already uploaded, just need checking

 15:17 <mapreri> yeah, unit193 msg'd me on irc a week or so ago about it

 15:17 <mapreri> so it's on my todo, but if you want to take it, go ahead

 15:18 <ddstreet> the limnoria one is done, i approved it earlier this week

 15:18 <ddstreet> i'll mark it

 15:18 <mapreri> ah good good ^^

 15:18 <ddstreet> and one more bug

 15:18 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+source/ipmctl/+bug/1968076

 15:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1968076 in ipmctl (Ubuntu Focal) "[BPO] ipmctl with support for CPS hardware" [Undecided, New]

 15:18 <ddstreet> i think this needs a sponsor

 15:19 <mapreri> yes

 15:19 <ddstreet> i think teward was going to sponsor it

 15:19 <ddstreet> i'll add a ping comment for him

 15:19 <mapreri> I guess we should either be hardliner and unsub us, or jfdi and sponsor itâ€¦?

 15:19 <mapreri> great

 15:20 <mapreri> handing out tasks to absentees... I love it! :D

 15:20 <ddstreet> i guess we can give it a bit more time before unsub

 15:20 <ddstreet> lol, he volunteered for it before so i'm re-purposing that :)

 15:20 <ddstreet> that's all the open bugs i see

 15:21 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 15:21 <ddstreet> ok any other topics?

 15:21 <mapreri> about the other bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115 - unit193 has some unpublished private patches I need to look at

 15:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1959115 in ubuntu-dev-tools (Ubuntu) "update backportpackage and requestbackport scripts to behave according to new backport process" [High, New]

 15:21 <ddstreet> ah crap i moved topics too fast

 15:21 <ddstreet> ok that's excellent!

 15:22 <mapreri> also just had a quick look at the queues, I haven't spotted pending uploads

 15:22 <ddstreet> i'll add an action in the bugs topic section, i had assumed there was no movement on that one

 15:22 <ddstreet> hmm i guess we should have a topic section for pending uploads

 15:22 <mapreri> those patches are drowned on my IRC scrollback, so I guess I need to either go fishing or ask about them -.-

 15:22 <ddstreet> i think we've been pretty good about reviewing fairly regularly though

 15:22 <mapreri> yeah

 15:22 <mapreri> I think we are fine atm

 15:23 <ddstreet> #action mapreri review ubuntu-dev-tools patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115

 15:23 * meetingology mapreri review ubuntu-dev-tools patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115

 15:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1959115 in ubuntu-dev-tools (Ubuntu) "update backportpackage and requestbackport scripts to behave according to new backport process" [High, New]

 15:23 <ddstreet> anything else before we decide on next mtg date?

 15:23 <mapreri> nope, I'm good

 15:23 <ddstreet> #subtopic next mtg date

 15:24 <mapreri> about thisâ€¦

 15:24 <mapreri> uh

 15:24 <mapreri> IRL meeting in prague?

 15:24 <ddstreet> you'll be in prague?

 15:24 <ddstreet> in nov?

 15:24 <mapreri> I'm unavailable the week before the summit (for another IRL event), and the week with the summit is no good for irc (probably), so either the week after orâ€¦?

 15:24 <mapreri> yes, I'll be

 15:25 <ddstreet> ah the ubuntu summit

 15:25 <ddstreet> i will likely not be there

 15:25 <mapreri> :(

 15:25 <ddstreet> i'm not sure if teward will

 15:25 <mapreri> would have loved to meet you there :)

 15:26 <ddstreet> yeah, since i'm no longer with canonical, i'll probably not travel to many ubuntu conf

 15:26 <ddstreet> i would have too!

 15:26 <ddstreet> i'll try to plan farther out to attend a future one

 15:26 <mapreri> you are still an active core-dev, so it shouldn't matter much since the whole idea was to gather a bit of community?  (at least, that's the public reason)

 15:27 <mapreri> but well, probably too late for planning?

 15:27 <ddstreet> sure, right, i just mean canonical use to pay for my travel to (some) confs

 15:27 <ddstreet> yeah i suspect it's too late for me to plan attending this one

 15:27 <ddstreet> just 1 month out

 15:27 <mapreri> so anyway, let's set for Nov 16th, 5 pm CET? (soâ€¦ 16 UTC I believe)?

 15:27 <mapreri> since there is DST changeâ€¦

 15:27 <mapreri> or do we want to keep the same?

 15:27 <mapreri> oh wait

 15:28 <ddstreet> nov 16 works for me

 15:28 <mapreri> actually 4pm CET is no good for meâ€¦, but 5pm CET is, soâ€¦

 15:29 <ddstreet> and i can do either, follow DST or not

 15:29 <ddstreet> so 5pm CET is 16:00 UTC on nov 16 right?

 15:29 <ddstreet> we're currently at 15:00 UTC for the mtg

 15:29 <ddstreet> right?

 15:29 <mapreri> going forward I have a recurring event on Wednesday that ends at 4pm CET (and then need to commute home)

 15:30 <mapreri> right, so let's move it to 16 UTC / 17 CET ?

 15:30 <ddstreet> sounds good, nov 16 at 16:00 UTC

 15:30 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet schedule next mtg nov 16 at 16:00 UTC

 15:30 * meetingology ddstreet schedule next mtg nov 16 at 16:00 UTC

 15:31 <ddstreet> any last topic before we end?

 15:31 <mapreri> I'm good

 15:31 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
