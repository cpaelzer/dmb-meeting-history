 16:04 <teward> mapreri: I thought Lintian has no maintainer anymore?

 16:04 <mapreri> teward: it has been adopted

 16:04 <teward> at least in Debian

 16:05 <teward> ack

 16:05 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 16:05 <ddstreet> do we want to keep this one?

 16:05 <mapreri> I poked, I don't remember what he said, too long ago

 16:05 <ddstreet> let's just drop it, i dont think it's important enough, yeah?

 16:05 <mapreri> mind keeping it, perhaps turning into "mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)"

 16:05 <ddstreet> ok sure, will do

 16:06 <ddstreet> #action mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)

 16:06 * meetingology mapreri to look into backporting dh-python (see unit193 and yt-dlp)

 16:06 <mapreri> I'm pretty sure having the new pybuild would be quite nice

 16:06 <ddstreet> #subtopic ddstreet update charter/policies from mapreri review email, send new email asking for review again

 16:06 <ddstreet> this was done

 16:06 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri review ubuntu-dev-tools patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115

 16:07 <mapreri> it's also duplicated, you already wrote it 4 minutes ago

 16:07 <mapreri> carry over pls

 16:07 <ddstreet> hah lol, it was in both our sections

 16:07 <ddstreet> #action mapreri review ubuntu-dev-tools patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115

 16:07 * meetingology mapreri review ubuntu-dev-tools patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools/+bug/1959115

 16:07 <ddstreet> ok that's all previous action items

 16:07 <mapreri> that's already 2 screenful of irc logs u.u

 16:08 <mapreri> we should really shave this backlog

 16:08 <teward> six here maprero (i'm on mobile irccloud >.<)

 16:08 <ddstreet> i hope once we get the charter stuff finished we can tackle some of the backlog

 16:08 <teward> mapreri*

 16:08 <ddstreet> the next section is ML threads, which would include charter talk, but can we go over bugs first?

 16:09 <mapreri> teward: I could move the workspace to the TV, then it would probably be "only one" :>

 16:09 <mapreri> ddstreet: let's do bugs quickly first yes

 16:09 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs

 16:09 <ddstreet> i have one to briefly discuss

 16:09 <ddstreet> #topic elfutils

 16:09 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/elfutils/+bug/1997189

 16:09 <mapreri> I haven't read that yet tbh, should I quickly do it?

 16:09 <ddstreet> i reviewed this and it seems fine

 16:10 <ddstreet> do read it briefly if you want, it's short

 16:10 <ddstreet> i dont see any issues with accepting the backport, but since it's a widely used lib i wanted to at least mention it here before accepting

 16:10 <mapreri> read.

 16:10 <mapreri> elfutils really shouldn't be a problem for me, imho.

 16:11 <teward> ddstreet: i dont have a problem with it but it seems by the description its dependent on another thing that hasnt been prepared

 16:11 <mapreri> besides, it's already in bpo in jammy?

 16:11 <teward> we can accept it but it was one of the 'clarify this bit' comments from me is all :)

 16:11 <mapreri> of course, before proceeding, since they want 0.188, that has to migrate from -proposed into release

 16:11 <ddstreet> teward[m] i may have missed that, what does it dep on?

 16:12 <mapreri> but since there is already a bpo in jammy, no reason to stop it for sure

 16:12 <ddstreet> mapreri ah right definitely does need to get out of lunar-proposed first

 16:12 <mapreri> teward: I don't think this requires anything new, does it?

 16:13 <teward> laggggg

 16:13 <teward> bug mentions debuginfod

 16:13 <mapreri> debuginfod is built from src:elfutils

 16:14 <teward> > I intend to update Ubuntu's debuginfod instance to use this new package in the near future.

 16:14 <ddstreet> i think he means ubuntu's running public debuginfod instance

 16:14 <teward> it sounded like it depended on something else as written

 16:14 <mapreri> nah

 16:14 <mapreri> it's saying that he wants to use this package for debunginfod.ubuntu.com

 16:15 <mapreri> or whatever was the address now

 16:15 <teward> wouldnt that require some approvals from a higher team?  not sure they like using backports stuff in prod

 16:15 <mapreri> BTW, the current bpo in jammy was also done by sergio, so really, imho no reason to block it, besides waiting for the migration to complete.

 16:15 <teward> not a blocker on our end as i said already

 16:15 <mapreri> teward: that's a problem for IS :>  I would really appreciate if they do, however

 16:16 <mapreri> after all, from my POV that's exactly what we are working for…

 16:16 <teward> *shrugs* I'm not IS so :P

 16:16 <ddstreet> i'll add a comment to the bug stating it looks ok but needs to migrate out of lunar-proposed first

 16:16 <mapreri> ack.

 16:16 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet comment in elfutils bug, needs to exit -proposed

 16:16 * meetingology ddstreet comment in elfutils bug, needs to exit -proposed

 16:17 <teward> in either case i said no problems with it, we just have to wait on it leaving proposed

 16:17 <mapreri> next bugs?  IMHO we need to talk about all the currently open bugs

 16:17 <teward> while we're at it, instruct sergio on how to properly bump topics for updates

 16:17 <ddstreet> #subtopic ipmictl

 16:17 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+source/ipmctl/+bug/1968076

 16:17 <teward> just saying "ping" isnt acceptable

 16:17 <ddstreet> i think this was waiting for teward[m] to sponsor?

 16:17 <mapreri> teward: are you ever going to sponsor this?

 16:17 <mapreri> :3

 16:18 <teward> i'll do that today - so much crap on the radar lately

 16:18 <ddstreet> #action teward[m] sponsor lp: #1968076

 16:18 * meetingology teward[m] sponsor lp: #1968076

 16:18 <ddstreet> thanks!

 16:18 <ddstreet> #subtopic man-db

 16:18 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/man-db/+bug/1992163

 16:18 <mapreri> should we finally reject this and make it wontfix?

 16:19 <teward> *reads*

 16:19 <ddstreet> it does seem more like a (performance) bugfix, not really something backports is intended for

 16:19 <mapreri> well, it's already "This bug report will be marked for expiration in 13 days if no further activity occurs. (find out why)", but I think it would be nicer to formally reject it

 16:19 <ddstreet> i'm fine with rejecting it

 16:20 <teward> i would reject it imo

 16:20 <ddstreet> ok anyone want to volunteer to do the rejection?

 16:20 <mapreri> good, I'll close it

 16:20 <teward> i will

 16:20 <teward> or not

 16:20 <ddstreet> lol

 16:20 <teward> mapreri has just volunteered

 16:20 <teward> :P

 16:20 <teward> mobile irc is slow >.<

 16:21 * mapreri wants to appear evil to all our contributors, VERY happy to do it

 16:21 <ddstreet> #action mapreri reject lp: #1992163

 16:21 * meetingology mapreri reject lp: #1992163

 16:21 <ddstreet> i think that's all the open bugs, any i missed?

 16:21 <mapreri> yep

 16:22 <ddstreet> ok movign to ml threads

 16:22 <ddstreet> #topic open mailing list threads

 16:22 <teward> back in 2 min switching to pc

 16:22 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:22 <ddstreet> i think this is carried still right

 16:22 <mapreri> carry on for now

 16:22 <ddstreet> #action clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:22 * meetingology clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:22 <mapreri> "action"?

 16:23 <mapreri> this is not actioning anybody, so it really shouldn't be imho

 16:23 <ddstreet> it makes it show up in the minutes, easier for me to cut n paste into the agenda

 16:23 <mapreri> as you prefer, happy to leave the chairing to you here :)

 16:23 <ddstreet> #subtopic charter/policies

 16:23 <ddstreet> you have the floor mapreri

 16:23 <ddstreet> :)

 16:24 <mapreri> so so

 16:24 <mapreri> I had a IRC chat with Robie (very nice really, much better than IRC :>) during the summit.

 16:24 <ddstreet> IRL?

 16:25 <mapreri> right s/a IRC/a IRL/

 16:25 <mapreri> He basically told me that he really wants to establish a charter, and from there continue and do it for many other teams.  However, he doesn't want to have anything that is remotely tied to team internal rules to be in there

 16:25 <mapreri> (will use '.' when I'm done)

 16:26 <mapreri> So, looking at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports/Charter what he want is only point 1 and 2; everything else is superfluous for him

 16:26 <mapreri> even point 3 that mentions that TB can override us, he feels like it's excessive, as it's implicit in how ubuntu development works (or, well, how the LP teams are structured, at the very least)

 16:27 <mapreri> I kind of managed to talk him into at least let us link the Policies page into the Charter, as in his opinion that's also something that doesn't belong there, just to say...

 16:28 <mapreri> Personally, I'm kind of conflicted, because I would appreciate having a team more rule-bound, but he seems to actually want less boundaries...

 16:28 <mapreri> .

 16:28 <rbasak> o/

 16:28 <rbasak> Well, you set your own rules, and that's fine.

 16:28 <rbasak> And document whatever you want as you see fit, including the rules, etc.

 16:28 <mapreri> do you have an highlight on "Robie"? :P

 16:28 <rbasak> But the text that the TB actually ratifies should be minimal.

 16:28 <rbasak> No I just happened to notice :)

 16:28 <teward> mapreri: he was was watching ;)

 16:29 <teward> *may or may not have given him a heads up his concerns were being addressed in meeting*

 16:29 <teward> ;)

 16:29 <ddstreet> re: keeping sections 1 and 2, obviously i'm fine with that :)

 16:30 <ddstreet> i think section 3 should be kept to make the fact explicit

 16:30 <mapreri> (OT: OOI, does ubuntu have any document similar to Debian's constitution that clarifies the role of the TB?)

 16:30 <rbasak> Section 3 is useful documentation to have, but it's superfluous in terms of what the TB would actually define to be the delegation to the backporters team

 16:30 <teward> mapreri: i think you mean this?  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard

 16:30 <rbasak> To be clear, I'm not saying you need to change that page.

 16:31 <rbasak> I'm just saying that it's out of scope of the delegation text that I want to arrange between the TB and the backporters team.

 16:31 <mapreri> teward: right, but that's more like shared documentation rather than anything community-voted or somesuch, right?

 16:32 <mapreri> ddstreet: possibly I guess I can live with moving section 4 and 5 into Policies and replace them with just a reference.

 16:32 <teward> i think TB is an ages old thing and any such 'voted upon' process is nonexistent

 16:32 <rbasak> But also, there's stuff I think should be added to 1 and 2, to cover the previous unfortunately events that I think we should try to avoid happening in the future.

 16:32 <teward> semi-bureaucracy not total democracy

 16:32 <rbasak> That's covered in my previous emails already.

 16:33 <mapreri> that should be the mail on april 5th btw

 16:33 <ddstreet> i think there are 2 perspectives on this: 1) the backporters team needs a defined, agreed on set of rules that we can operate on, and 2) the TB wants specific wording in the charter

 16:34 <mapreri> I don't think the TB wants any "specific wording"?  what are you referring to?

 16:34 <ddstreet> by "specific woding" i mean anything other than what's in the doc now

 16:35 <ddstreet> #1 has been pending, in dicussion, for almost a year - i really want to have a set of rules without much more delay

 16:35 <ddstreet> #2, IMHO, is entirely up to the TB and really they can mandate whatever they want in our charter at any time

 16:35 <rbasak> What if we view those two things as orthogonal - as long as they're compatible?

 16:35 <mapreri> according to what Robie wrote in those mails (correct me if I'm wrong), he would like to see something written about delivery expectation from us?  Something like a SLA?

 16:35 <teward> can i put a third perspective in

 16:35 <teward> my perspective is as follows:

 16:36 <rbasak> 1) You define your own rules. The TB doesn't care unless someone escalates a complaint to us.

 16:36 <ddstreet> what i'd like is to come to team agreement on our rules by EOY, then the TB is free to come up with whatever charter wording they feel is appropriate for us

 16:36 <rbasak> 2) We agree a separate text between the backporters team and the TB. As long as you can work within them (ie. they're compatible), it should matter what you do in your own rules.

 16:36 <rbasak> Would that work for you?

 16:37 <rbasak> Sorry, *shouldn't* matter

 16:37 <teward> ddstreet: i think we already *have* agreement on our rules though, within the team

 16:37 <teward> so the issue is only whether they need to be defined in the charter, which I don't think they have to

 16:37 <teward> we can do that as simple as this:

 16:37 <ddstreet> of course, as the current charter draft says, the TB governs the team - we operate under whatever set of guidelines or rules the TB provides to us which the TB can change at any time

 16:38 <teward> 3: Rules - The Backporters team defines its own rules of operation within the rules set forth by any TB governance or decisions.  This is defined in an internal Backporters document.

 16:38 <ddstreet> teward[m] yeah but unofficial agreement isn't good enough...rules are meant to be used during disagreements, which means the rules need to be official

 16:38 <teward> Then we keep a Backporters team document for our agreed upon rules

 16:38 <rbasak> I think maybe we're getting tied up in the meaning of "charter".

 16:38 <teward> ^^

 16:38 <ddstreet> sure i dont care if all the charter wording is moved to our policies page

 16:39 <ddstreet> but in that case, we're not creating our own charter, the TB is creating a charter for us

 16:39 <ddstreet> which again, is fine, they govern us

 16:39 <teward> lets start over at the base definition of "charter".  per oxford dictionary: "a written grant by a country's legislative or sovereign power, by which a body such as a company, college, or city is founded and its rights and privileges defined.".  TB wants us to draft a charter that they can approve, they don't want to write it themselves.  This does *not* however need to include a rules/policies section, it's simply a declaration of

 16:39 <teward> delegation

 16:39 <ddstreet> 99% of my goal on this is to prevent a year-long delay from ever happening again, like this ;-)

 16:40 <teward> what TB wants is something that declares our scope and what we cover, that they can approve

 16:40 <teward> i.e. sections 1 and 2

 16:40 <ddstreet> i'm not sure what we are talking about

 16:40 <teward> we can define rules with internal agreement independent from TB without TB needing to OK those rules

 16:40 <ddstreet> what's the proposal?

 16:40 <teward> ddstreet: stop talking for a bit and let me speak

 16:40 <teward> **I have the talking stick now**

 16:40 <rbasak> they don't want to write it themselves> well, I did propose a draft, written back in July 2021, and proposed in Feb 2022.

 16:41 <rbasak> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2021-July/041559.html

 16:41 <rbasak> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022687.html

 16:41 <rbasak> But apart from that, yes, I agree.

 16:41 <teward> there's two forms of the propsal pending.  firstly what Robie has sent back in the past with drafts, and secondly what we have in our charter draft document on the wiki

 16:42 <teward> my understanding of what the TB has said about "We just want the charter, not your rules, etc. for our ratification" is they *simply* want us to specify our mission statement, and the delegation of authority for the TB to approve.  Because the TB in the governance chain sits under the CC/Mark (delegated powers for technical decisions in the Ubuntu world) and in turn any delegation by the TB to another team is in turn governeed by the

 16:42 <teward> TB

 16:43 <teward> section 3 is 'extraneous' because of the delegation of the governance tree as it stands

 16:43 <teward> section 4 the TB doesn't want to ratify because if the TB ratifies those rules then it implies the TB defines our rules, which is not what the TB wants - they want us to define our rules **which we can approve independently of the TB ratification of the charter and privilege delegation**

 16:44 <teward> it's implied already by the governance tree that the BT (Backporters Team for shorthand now) will obey any TB decision because of the governance tree

 16:44 <teward> so to solve section 4 with the rules:

 16:45 <teward> we can simply put in the 'charter' if we're insistent about it that "The Backporters Team defines its own rules and policies for handling its delegated powers, which is defined in publicly-visible documentation [here](link)"

 16:45 <teward> and while we're at that, waiting for the TB to process the charter, we officially *vote* on the rules and policies for the BT

 16:45 <teward> as we're still building out the full rules for how a package qualifies for backports, that's independent from the BT rules of operation/procedures

 16:46 <teward> so there's really three separate things being comingled here

 16:46 <teward> (1) basic charter requirements (see my notes)

 16:46 <teward> (2) BT rules of operation and policy.

 16:46 <teward> (3) definition of backports and how they work

 16:46 <teward> we've pretty much done #3

 16:46 <teward> we simply need a vote on #2

 16:47 <teward> and with my notes on sections 3 and 4 we simply need to simplify our existing draft to the bare minimum of what a charter is - specify our mission and what we're delegated to do by the TB.

 16:47 <teward> rbasak: am I missing something in my assessment?

 16:47 <teward> (sorry that i have to assert the talking stick but the crosstalk wasn't working)

 16:48 <rbasak> That's pretty close to my thinking, thanks.

 16:48 <teward> now i'm done with my monologue.

 16:48 <teward> comments?

 16:48 <teward> questions/concerns with my assessment?

 16:49 <rbasak> You shouldn't feel blocked by the TB on achieving (2).

 16:49 <teward> *goes to make coffee because he desperately needs a third cup*

 16:49 <ddstreet> if i understand right, then let's do the (maybe?) easy part; first proposal is to move sections 4 and 5 of our charter doc into https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports/Policies

 16:49 <ddstreet> right?

 16:49 * genii twitches at the mention of coffee, follows teward

 16:49 <mapreri> ack (moving sections 4/5)

 16:49 <teward> ddstreet: essentially, yes, move sections 4 and 5 from charter to Policies in internal documentation

 16:50 <rbasak> No objection from me, if you're asking me? From my perspective, that kind of thing is entirely up to BT and not a concern of the TB.

 16:50 <ddstreet> ok with no objection, i'll action that

 16:50 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet move charter sections 4 and 5 into policies wiki page

 16:50 * meetingology ddstreet move charter sections 4 and 5 into policies wiki page

 16:50 <ddstreet> ok next, charter section 3 should be removed, correct?

 16:50 <mapreri> then, about #1, there is probably stuff to add from https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022687.html ?

 16:50 <rbasak> (to be clear, unless someone escalates a complaint, but that hasn't happened and iss a standing exception with everything of course)

 16:50 <teward> ddstreet: i think it can be left there, but the TB's concern is that it's superfluous.  I have no objection to it staying or being removed either way

 16:51 <ddstreet> i dont care either, but we should be able to agree now on either way i think

 16:51 <ddstreet> unless there is objection, i'll remove it

 16:51 <rbasak> There's what we end up agreeing between TB and BT, and what's on the wiki page. I only care about the former.

 16:51 <rbasak> IOW, I think it's up to you how you want to arrange the wiki documentation, for example.

 16:51 <teward> no objections here.

 16:51 <mapreri> ddstreet: after teward's essay, I'd probably reword it as part of the delegation.  "TB delegates this and taht..." (and so, it's obvious that's the body governing us)

 16:52 <ddstreet> mapreri you think we should keep it?

 16:52 <rbasak> But you seem to be aiming at making that page the agreed text between TB and BT.

 16:52 <teward> mapreri: sorry but i've been reviewing policy like hell lately with CC tasks so, dissecting policy proposals is a thing I just do now xD

 16:52 <ddstreet> mapreri i'd prefer to remove it to avoid any future discussion on it

 16:53 <mapreri> ack then, I don't really feel strong about it

 16:53 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet remove charter section 3

 16:53 * meetingology ddstreet remove charter section 3

 16:53 <rbasak> OTOH, I am aiming at making some paragraphs the agreed the text between the TB and BT, and assume that you'll be documenting that in a subset of a wiki page somewhere, so that you can put explanation and helpful links around it.

 16:53 <rbasak> How that ends up in your wiki is up to you

 16:53 <ddstreet> ok on to the main event, sections 1 and 2

 16:54 <ddstreet> so, if this particular wiki page isn't important to the TB, as you indicated rbasak, i think we should simply drop it completely

 16:54 <ddstreet> and then i think the backports team can assume the TB will generate and maintain a charter for us somewhere, right?

 16:55 * mapreri goes find a ML-based charter generator

 16:55 <ddstreet> so, assuming all that is left on our charter wiki page is sections 1 and 2, then mapreri teward[m] do either of you think we need to keep that page?

 16:56 <rbasak> There are some other conversations with other teams that are needing some kind of formal delegation text from the TB (ie. "charter" if you like) for their own reasons. I expect that the TB will want to have a central page with these documented somewhere, right.

 16:56 <ddstreet> right, the TB is going to centralize subteam charter documentation

 16:56 <ddstreet> so that isn't something our team should even bother with

 16:56 <ddstreet> if i understand right

 16:56 <rbasak> Whatever text we come up with for the backporters team (well, I have come up with a text!), I'd like to make sure you're happy with it. That's why I'm here :)

 16:57 <rbasak> If you would prefer, I can just ask the TB to consider my draft, and say that's your preference.

 16:57 <ddstreet> ok so as a next proposal, mapreri teward[m] i think we should completely remove our charter page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports/Charter

 16:57 <rbasak> But if you don't think that'll work for you, then this is the time to adjust it.

 16:57 <ddstreet> any disagreement?

 16:57 <mapreri> ddstreet: if you are feeling like telling rbasak to go with https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-February/022687.html - then I'd like to change a few words here and there?

 16:57 <mapreri> I think we could replace the text in that page with this and re-evaluate that?

 16:57 <ddstreet> well i disagree with rbasak's proposal in that email

 16:58 <ddstreet> as i said in my response on the ML

 16:58 <ddstreet> my main goal at the moment is simply getting our team's rules/policies through this process

 16:59 <teward> which we can do independent of the charter.

 16:59 <ddstreet> i'm happy to focus on discussion with the TB about our charter AFTER we have offcial rules/policies

 16:59 <mapreri> I think after moving sections 4 and 5 into Policies we can go ahead and vote on that and be done with the policies

 16:59 <ddstreet> sounds good

 16:59 <ddstreet> so i have actions for that, can we also agree for me to remove our charter wiki page?

 16:59 <mapreri> … but for the charter I fear we are still quite in disagreement duh.

 16:59 <ddstreet> yeah let's defer charter discussion with the TB

 17:00 <rbasak> I'm disappointed that you're deferring this. It's been nine months.

 17:00 <ddstreet> we have 1 minute left in our hour, as well

 17:00 <mapreri> well, unless you want to the TB to write the text themselves, and I fear they will just take rbasak's text, then yes, we should work on this more.

 17:00 <teward> rbasak: i have a hard stop now at noon so

 17:00 <teward> (phone call with CEO @ Day Job RE: Network Security)

 17:00 <rbasak> Maybe I can work with mapreri to find an agreement between us, and you can delegate your wishes to him?

 17:00 <ddstreet> no objection to removing our charter page? that doesn't mean we can't discuss the details with TB later

 17:00 * mapreri will read slowly again the past mail thread…

 17:00 <ddstreet> rbasak no the discussion should happen with our whole team

 17:00 <mapreri> ddstreet: please leave it there, perhaps blank.

 17:00 <ddstreet> but after we have rules/policies

 17:01 <ddstreet> mapreri ack, so leave the page, but remove sections 1 and 2

 17:01 <ddstreet> yeah?

 17:01 <ddstreet> the wiki history will of course still be available

 17:01 <mapreri> together with all the other sections :>

 17:01 <mapreri> so yes

 17:01 <ddstreet> yep

 17:01 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet remove charter sections 1 and 2 (but leave page)

 17:01 * meetingology ddstreet remove charter sections 1 and 2 (but leave page)

 17:01 <mapreri> exactly to have the history, for now at least

 17:01 <ddstreet> ok we're at time now

 17:02 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 17:02 <mapreri> none from me

 17:02 <ddstreet> ok, as we're beyond time, let's call it then, thanks all o/

 17:02 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
