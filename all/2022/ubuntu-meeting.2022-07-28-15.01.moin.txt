 15:01 <jawn-smith> #topic Lightning Round

 15:01 <jawn-smith> The status is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-28-july-2022/29761/2

 15:01 <jawn-smith> Let's take our usual few minutes to read and ask questions

 15:02 <sil2100> o/

 15:04 <sil2100> I still didn't manage to put my status yet, but uh

 15:04 <sil2100> I'll do that later I promise

 15:04 <bdmurray> me too!

 15:04 <bdmurray> ;-)

 15:05 <bdmurray> slyon: regarding --blocked-by-tests - do you think it is good to merge? I understand there are issue with '--blocked-by'

 15:06 <slyon> bdmurray: Yes I think it's good to merge

 15:06 <bdmurray> I'd ask everybody for an opinion but don't want to bikeshed the argument name

 15:07 <bdmurray> and PSA - the proxy issues in bos01 are sorted now

 15:07 <jawn-smith> Okay any questions\o/

 15:07 <jawn-smith> oops forgot to backspace out my earlier comment

 15:09 <jawn-smith> I'll give until 10 minutes after the hour to ask any more questions

 15:10 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:10 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:10 <jawn-smith> bug 1981109

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1981109 in livecd-rootfs (Ubuntu) "server image pulls in ModemManager via fwupd, consumes 25MiB RAM in every container" [High, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981109

 15:10 <jawn-smith> I seem to recall discussing this one last week

 15:10 * jawn-smith reads logs

 15:12 <jawn-smith> Last week it looked like this was being worked by the desktop team, but looking at the LP bug it seems v_orlon has been doing some work on it

 15:12 <jawn-smith> So it looks like the foundations work for that is done for now

 15:13 <jawn-smith> No need to create any cards

 15:13 <jawn-smith> And we'll wait on desktop to fix the modemmanager issue

 15:13 <jawn-smith> bug 1981721

 15:13 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:13 <slyon> let's skip the netplan one. it's waiting for openstack team input

 15:13 <jawn-smith> Okay, moving on

 15:14 <jawn-smith> bug 1982486

 15:14 <ubottu> Bug 1982486 in update-notifier (Ubuntu) "update-motd-fsck-at-reboot: exclude nbd devices" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1982486

 15:16 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: you tagged this

 15:16 <bdmurray> Yes, there are branches for review and it seems easy

 15:16 <jawn-smith> Would you be the one working on this?

 15:17 <bdmurray> maybe‽

 15:20 <jawn-smith> So let's card it and if bdmurray can't work on it can you find someone else to?

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Okay that's it for kk

 15:21 <jawn-smith> I think something is wrong with the rls-jj page

 15:21 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <jawn-smith> It has bugs listed in "unknown" that seem like they should be foundations bugs

 15:22 <bdmurray> o really?

 15:22 <jawn-smith> For example, bug 1981721

 15:22 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:22 <jawn-smith> which is one that was in the foundations-bugs section for rls-kk-incoming

 15:24 <jawn-smith> The QA team is going to investigate the messed up report

 15:25 <jawn-smith> We discussed the previously mentioned bug already

 15:25 <jawn-smith> Are there any other bugs in this list that look foundations-y

 15:25 <jawn-smith> ?

 15:25 * juliank forgot to join after joining his train

 15:25 <jawn-smith> ‽

 15:25 <schopin> bug 1973037

 15:25 <ubottu> Bug 1973037 in llvm-toolchain-13 (Ubuntu Kinetic) "llvm-toolchain-13: please backport upstream D115098 for rust" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1973037

 15:26 <jawn-smith> Thanks schopin

 15:26 <jawn-smith> schopin: were you planning to work this bug?

 15:26 <schopin> I had assumed the security team would have imported the fixed package from the mozilla-security-rust PPA along with rustc, but apparently they didn't.

 15:27 <schopin> I guess I'll do it the old fashion way :)

 15:28 <jawn-smith> Okay thanks, let's card it and assign to schopin then

 15:29 <jawn-smith> Okay I _think_ that's it for foundations bugs in jj

 15:29 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:29 <jawn-smith> This report is also messed up, so let's look carefully at the packages here

 15:30 <jawn-smith> waveform: There's bug 1874354

 15:30 <ubottu> Bug 1874354 in linux-meta-raspi (Ubuntu) "limited wireles channels on a RPi 3B" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1874354

 15:30 <jawn-smith> Probably a kernel team thing, bug anything for us to do here?

 15:30 <jawn-smith> s/bug/but/

 15:31 <jawn-smith> Sounds like waveform will investigate that. mclemenceau would you mind carding and assigning to waveform ?

 15:32 <mclemenceau> ok

 15:32 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:32 <jawn-smith> Does anyone else see any foundations bugs on this list?

 15:33 <bdmurray> I see nothing

 15:34 <jawn-smith> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:34 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:34 * jawn-smith scrolls past the hefty list of MIR related issues

 15:35 <jawn-smith> curl was with alexghiti

 15:35 <bdmurray> I retried the zlib issues

 15:35 <alexghiti> It is fixed and waiting for a sponsor

 15:35 <jawn-smith> Oh great

 15:35 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:35 <jawn-smith> I can look into sponsoring that

 15:35 <alexghiti> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/+bug/1982545

 15:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1982545 in curl (Ubuntu) "FTBFS on riscv64" [Undecided, New]

 15:36 <jawn-smith> I'll put that on my list

 15:36 <jawn-smith> gcc-12 missing builds

 15:37 <jawn-smith> Seems like a doko task, yes?

 15:37 <slyon> wrt. MIR issues: I think we can actually resolve the usb-creator case: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libisoburn/+bug/1977959/comments/18 needs an AA to demote a leaf binary. CC sil2100

 15:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1977959 in libisoburn (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libisoburn, libburn, libisofs" [Undecided, In Progress]

 15:38 <slyon> basically demoting the "xorriso-tcltk" binary package

 15:38 <slyon> this will unblock libisoburn and thus usb-creator, too

 15:38 <doko> jawn-smith: the missing builds are a LP/IS issue

 15:38 <jawn-smith> doko: do they just need to be retried?

 15:40 <jawn-smith> Okay so we'll wait on LP team to fix that

 15:42 <jawn-smith> slyon: did you have an AA in mind to do the demotion?

 15:42 <jawn-smith> Or a bug filed to get that done?

 15:42 <slyon> I put one in CC up there :)

 15:42 <jawn-smith> oh you sure did, thanks!

 15:43 <slyon> otherwise, it already shows up in the AAs list of component-mismatches: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html – so should be resolved eventually, no need for an extra bug

 15:46 <jawn-smith> irssi sounds like a dependency issue

 15:46 <jawn-smith> schopin has volunteered to follow up on that

 15:47 <jawn-smith> zlib appears to need an investigation: any volunteers?

 15:47 <jawn-smith> ogayot: zlib?

 15:48 <ogayot> ack

 15:48 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:48 <jawn-smith> fwupd is something I've worked on before so I'll investigate that

 15:48 <jawn-smith> the snelin vs sqlite3 probably needs a retry

 15:49 <jawn-smith> This libgd-perl stuff is a dependency wait issue

 15:50 <jawn-smith> bdrung: Do you mind looking into that to see if there's anything we can do at the moment?

 15:50 <bdrung> okay. I can do.

 15:50 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:50 <jawn-smith> any volunteers for apt?

 15:51 <jawn-smith> juliank: apt?

 15:51 <juliank> I guess

 15:51 <jawn-smith> waveform is taking sbuild

 15:51 <jawn-smith> Thanks juliank!

 15:51 <jawn-smith> systemd: slyon?

 15:51 <slyon> yes!

 15:52 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:53 <jawn-smith> Alright that's it for proposed migration this week

 15:53 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 15:54 <bdrung> apport bug #1967965 - should we card that as well?

 15:54 <ubottu> Bug 1967965 in apport (Ubuntu) "apport-kde: 'Other problem' and 'Display' options are swapped" [High, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1967965

 15:55 <slyon> doko: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:56 <slyon> doko: sorry, this one: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html#libisoburn

 15:56 <slyon> (i.e. we need to demote the xorriso-tcltk binary)

 15:57 <jawn-smith> Normally we don't do flavor-specific bugs but this one might be worth it

 15:58 <bdmurray> because it is affecting the quality of the bug reports and infromation we get

 15:59 <jawn-smith> Okay let's card that bug

 15:59 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
