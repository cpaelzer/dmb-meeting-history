 20:03 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board 5th May 2022

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:03:54 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:04 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 5th May 2022. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:04 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:04 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:04 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:04 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:04 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:04 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:04 <diddledani> First up we have DD3my . Hi, could you please introduce yourself to the board and share your wiki/discourse page(s) and your launchpad URL

 20:05 <DD3my> Nice to meet you, I'm Daniele De Michele, aka dd3my and I've been part of the Ubuntu-it group for several years

 20:06 <DD3my> Within the newsletter group, I participate in the writing, revision and layout of the newsletter in pdf. Also, I devote my energies to updating the documentation. I am active in the Italian Ubuntu IRC channels and I try to entice users to join our community.

 20:06 <DD3my> My Lauchpad profile is : https://launchpad.net/~dd3my

 20:07 <DD3my> while my wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dd3my

 20:08 <diddledani> for the record, DD3my also has a discourse thread with testimonials at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/dd3my-membership-application/28146

 20:08 <mapreri> Personally I also suppose his application, as I've worked with DD3my for several years mostly in the context of the newsletter writing and doc maintenance.  He is also somewhat involved in the maintenance of ubuntu-it's social media

 20:08 <mapreri> s/suppose/support/

 20:08 <DD3my> diddledani, yes exactly; thank you

 20:09 <mapreri> I didn't quite wanted to write a formal endorsement as I kind of perceived a conflict of interest hereâ€¦?

 20:09 <diddledani> thank you DD3my . I'll give the board members a couple of minutes to read through and then I'll open the floor for questions

 20:10 <DD3my> diddledani, perfect :)

 20:11 <Kilos> hmm...

 20:11 <diddledani> ok, board members, have at it :-) ask any questions you have of dd3my

 20:12 <DD3my> diddledani,

 20:12 <DD3my> also I was completing to update my personal wiki page, however as I was saying previously, I had some latency

 20:12 <Kilos> your discourse page is ok

 20:12 <diddledani> don't worry, DD3my

 20:12 <diddledani> snags happen :-)

 20:13 <mapreri> DD3my: do you have any plans (or dreams!) to start to contribute directly to any part of the international community?  You wrote that your English is limited, but from what you wrote here and there it looks fine enough to me :)

 20:13 <Kilos> I  agree

 20:13 <diddledani> thirded :-D

 20:13 <diddledani> your English is good!

 20:14 <Kilos> but maybe you are too young

 20:14 <Kilos> joking

 20:15 * diddledani looks in the mirror.. :'(

 20:15 <diddledani> I am an old!

 20:15 <DD3my> mapreri, mine are very ambitious, I have to be honest

 20:15 <Kilos> age diddledani  ?

 20:16 <Kilos> hi nicoz[m]

 20:16 <nicoz[m]> Hi all :*

 20:16 <Mr_Pan> o/

 20:17 <DD3my> mapreri, the second aspect was to provide news every week with the publication of the newsletter

 20:18 <DD3my> while as far as my english is concerned, I have to help myself every now and then with google translate :)

 20:18 <Kilos> DD3my  the more you use english the better you get
