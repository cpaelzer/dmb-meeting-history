 15:01 <jawn-smith> Let's take a moment to read and ask questions

 15:01 <slyon> o/

 15:01 <sil2100> I did not write my status again, it starting to become a habit. I blame the point-releases

 15:10 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:10 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:11 <jawn-smith> bug 1982791

 15:11 <ubottu> Bug 1982791 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "An EoL release cannot dist-upgrade if not all updates are installed and the release has been archived to old-releases" [High, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1982791

 15:11 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: You tagged this one

 15:12 <bdmurray> This won't matter for KK but will for LL

 15:13 <bdmurray> so let's retag in rls-ll-incoming

 15:13 <jawn-smith> Okay sounds good to me.

 15:13 <jawn-smith> bug 1982486

 15:13 <ubottu> Bug 1982486 in update-notifier (Ubuntu Kinetic) "update-motd-fsck-at-reboot: exclude nbd devices" [High, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1982486

 15:14 <jawn-smith> We discussed this last week, let me read the logs

 15:14 <bdmurray> we carded it so it just needs cleaning which I'll do

 15:14 <jawn-smith> Great, thanks.

 15:14 <jawn-smith> bug 1315559

 15:14 <ubottu> Bug 1315559 in apport (Ubuntu) "UpgradeStatus can be incorrect" [Medium, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1315559

 15:14 <jawn-smith> that's a low number

 15:15 <jawn-smith> Reported by bdmurray in 2014

 15:15 <bdmurray> vintage

 15:15 <jawn-smith> Has something changed to make this more urgent?

 15:15 <bdmurray> It confused Steve in https://errors.ubuntu.com/oops/2ccb554c-1279-11ed-b06e-fa163ef35206

 15:15 <bdmurray> UpgradeStatus

 15:15 <bdmurray> Upgraded to groovy on 2022-08-02 (0 days ago)

 15:16 <vorlon> which I was only paying attention to because it was an ubuntu-release-upgrade crash

 15:17 <jawn-smith> Sounds worth working then, let's card it

 15:17 <mclemenceau> ok

 15:17 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 15:17 <bdmurray> Its horribly confusing and only somebody who is part of the furniture would know why its wrong

 15:18 <jawn-smith> bug 1979952

 15:18 <ubottu> Bug 1979952 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Bind mount to NFS mount fails on Ubuntu 22.04" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1979952

 15:18 <enr0n> I was able to confirm this is present in jammy and kinetic

 15:18 <jawn-smith> Looks like there's an upstream fix already

 15:18 <enr0n> There is a straight forward upstream fix available which I have tested

 15:18 <slyon> sounds like a nice inclusion for the next jammy SRU

 15:18 <enr0n> So I think we should card this and include it in the upcoming jammy SRU for systemd

 15:18 <jawn-smith> Alright let's card it and remove the tag then, sounds like enr0n is on top of it

 15:19 <bdmurray> Is there a timeline for that?

 15:19 <bdmurray> After .1?

 15:19 <slyon> yes, after .1. The last one was just 1 month ago

 15:20 <enr0n> Yeah that makes sense.

 15:20 <jawn-smith> Is the systemd SRU cycle documented somewhere?

 15:20 <slyon> so unless we need some critical fix, we wait a bit more

 15:20 <jawn-smith> Just for my own curiosity

 15:20 <slyon> jawn-smith: it is not, AFAIK

 15:20 <jawn-smith> Okay, that might be something worth doing... eventually

 15:20 <slyon> ack

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Alright that's getting carded. Moving on

 15:21 <jawn-smith> bug 1981109

 15:21 <ubottu> Bug 1981109 in modemmanager (Ubuntu) "server image pulls in ModemManager via fwupd, consumes 25MiB RAM in every container" [High, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981109

 15:21 <sil2100> huh

 15:21 <sil2100> When adding the new RISC-V platforms, some of the generic non-SUBARCH code

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Last we discussed this there was nothing for foundations to work on.

 15:21 <sil2100> went missing and some invalid assumptions have been made, causing cloud

 15:21 <sil2100> eeek, accidental paste

 15:21 <sil2100> ...please ignore

 15:22 <jawn-smith> It's marked as fixed in livecd-rootfs. vorlon do you agree there is currently nothing for foundations to work on related to this bug?

 15:22 <vorlon> it needs to be fixed in jammy

 15:22 <vorlon> so should probably be carded for that

 15:23 <jawn-smith> Ah okay, let's card that then

 15:24 <mclemenceau> ok

 15:24 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:24 <jawn-smith> bug 1981721

 15:24 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:24 <jawn-smith> slyon: are we still waiting on openstack input?

 15:24 <slyon> no update on that since last week, so let's skip

 15:24 <jawn-smith> Cool, that's it for kk

 15:24 <slyon> i think it's not very high priority for the openstack team

 15:24 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:24 <bdmurray> dupes

 15:25 <jawn-smith> ah, looks like both of these jj bugs have already been discussed/carded

 15:25 <jawn-smith> rls-ff is empty for foundations, but has a few unknowns again

 15:25 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:25 <jawn-smith> None of those look like foundations packages to me. Agreed?

 15:26 <bdmurray> +1

 15:26 * bdrung agrees

 15:26 <jawn-smith> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:26 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:26 <jawn-smith> vorlon:

 15:27 <slyon> re lintian: we could promote libregexp-wildcards-perl, the MIR is ready (LP: #1980968)

 15:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980968 in lintian (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libregexp-wildcards-perl" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1980968

 15:28 <slyon> which would resolve one of the dependencies

 15:28 <slyon> others are still pending

 15:28 <vorlon> ubuntu-meta: still in desktop team's hands

 15:29 <vorlon> lintian: in MIR land per the above

 15:29 <vorlon> but the MIR tasks are marked incomplete?

 15:30 <slyon> yes. those are still pending. only libregexp-wildcards-perl is done

 15:30 <vorlon> looks like this is largely with ginggs who I believe is out this week

 15:30 <slyon> which is a different LP bug

 15:30 <slyon> that's true.

 15:31 <vorlon> mutt has been blocked on gsasl for 25 days; I don't see that this was assigned out last week or discussed?

 15:31 <slyon> vorlon: that's a MIR as well, blocked on security review

 15:32 <vorlon> aha thanks, hadn't clicked through on the bug yet

 15:32 <vorlon> gcc-12, looks like we're waiting for doko, who is also out this week

 15:34 <vorlon> ogayot: are you still on zlib?

 15:34 <vorlon> sounds like gcc-12 is hamstrung by launchpad build farm issues that we're waiting for a resolution on

 15:34 <ogayot> fheimes has been actively working on that one, I tested the patch from bug 1983255 but unfortunately still red for me

 15:34 <ubottu> Bug 1983255 in samtools-legacy (Ubuntu) "samtools-legacy misses 'Remove compressBound assertions' (PR #1258) fix" [High, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1983255

 15:35 <vorlon> ogayot: ok, and this is a real regression introduced by new zlib?

 15:35 <schopin> seems likely, as the new upload was for s390x specific code.

 15:36 <ogayot> using an old zlib does not trigger the bug, but I don't think this is strictly caused by zlib

 15:36 <vorlon> ogayot: but in any case we need tests fixed before we progress, ok

 15:36 <vorlon> sqlite3 vs senlin: this was mentioned last week as 'probably needs a retry' but it's still stuck

 15:37 <vorlon> and was retried several times on the 31st so this needs someone to take it and dig in

 15:37 <vorlon> bdmurray: can you take this?

 15:38 <bdmurray> maybe

 15:39 <vorlon> waveform: can you take senlin?

 15:39 <waveform> I'm out next week, so if it can wait a week, yes

 15:40 <vorlon> you mean you can't fix it tomorrow? :)

 15:40 <vorlon> anyway

 15:40 <vorlon> waveform: senlin/sqlite3

 15:40 <bdmurray> senlin passes in debian so I can try it with more resources

 15:40 <waveform> ack :)

 15:40 <schopin> I'll take rustc vs llvm

 15:40 <vorlon> schopin: thanks

 15:41 <vorlon> libgd-perl was mis-triaged last week, it was dep-wait but required someone to make changes to get the new build-deps built on i386.  That was done, then it failed to install those build-deps; I'm going to retry it and I'll follow through

 15:42 <vorlon> apt missing builds, also an i386 issue somehow, I'll follow up (I think this was already cleared)

 15:42 <bdrung> the regression there on gbrowse was reported as Debian bug #1014797 and forwarded upstream (no response there yet)

 15:42 <ubottu> Debian bug 1014797 in src:gbrowse "FTBFS: test failures with new libgd3" [Serious, Open] https://bugs.debian.org/1014797

 15:43 <bdrung> (referring to libgd-perl)

 15:43 <vorlon> devscripts ALSO dep-wait on i386

 15:43 <vorlon> for the same package as apt, so I'll take that too :/

 15:43 <slyon> I'll take liburi-perl, because TIL

 15:43 <vorlon> slyon: thanks

 15:44 <vorlon> let's give curl / hddemux to dbungert

 15:46 <vorlon> bdmurray: can you take libuv1?

 15:46 <vorlon> eh

 15:46 <vorlon> bdrung: can you take libuv1? :)

 15:46 <bdrung> I prefer to look an the sudo regressions

 15:48 <vorlon> ok

 15:48 <vorlon> enr0n: can you take libuv1?

 15:49 <enr0n> Yes indeed

 15:49 <vorlon> jawn-smith: can you take casper?

 15:49 <jawn-smith> ack

 15:49 <vorlon> and that's it

 15:49 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 15:52 <jawn-smith> Any holidays or vacations coming up?

 15:53 <bdrung> soon-ish (but not next week)

 15:54 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
