 15:00 <jawn-smith> #topic Lightning Round

 15:01 <jawn-smith> The status is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-21-july-2022/29675

 15:01 <jawn-smith> Let's take our usual few minutesx to read and ask questions

 15:02 <bdrung> o/

 15:03 <jawn-smith> dbungert: I started reviewing some of the patches you created

 15:03 <dbungert> nice

 15:05 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:05 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:06 <jawn-smith> bug 1981109

 15:06 <ubottu> Bug 1981109 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "server image pulls in ModemManager via fwupd, consumes 25MiB RAM in every container" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981109

 15:06 <jawn-smith> That is being worked by the desktop

 15:06 <jawn-smith> bug 1981721

 15:06 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:07 <slyon> jawn-smith: we can let that one sit there for now. I've reached out to the openstack team and they will help with reproduction

 15:07 <bdmurray> Can we do anything about the bug status and importance in bug 1981109

 15:07 <ubottu> Bug 1981109 in modemmanager (Ubuntu) "server image pulls in ModemManager via fwupd, consumes 25MiB RAM in every container" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981109

 15:09 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: thanks for setting the importance and triaged on that bug

 15:09 <jawn-smith> bug 1982462

 15:09 <ubottu> Bug 1982462 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Some modprobe loading services requested by the pstore service fail" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1982462

 15:10 <slyon> this one was reported by the Ubuntu core team. Seems there is an easy upstream fix available.

 15:10 <slyon> I think it'd make sense to spot check the proposed solution and maybe also include it into the pending Jammy SRU, cc enr0n

 15:10 <slyon> so should be carded IMO

 15:10 <enr0n> Yeah, this is probably worth SRU'ing. The patch we added as a result of bug 1978079 has caused a few head aches (see rls-jj-incoming later).

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1978079 in systemd (Ubuntu Focal) "EFI pstore not cleared on boot" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1978079

 15:11 <jawn-smith> Okay cool, slyon do you mind creating a card?

 15:11 <slyon> jawn-smith: I can do that!

 15:11 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:11 <jawn-smith> That's it for kk

 15:11 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:12 <bdmurray> a "few headaches"? how important are those?

 15:12 <enr0n> bdmurray: I'll elaborate when we get to that bug

 15:12 <jawn-smith> pausing to discuss the few headaches

 15:13 <jawn-smith> Okay, bug 1970449

 15:13 <ubottu> Bug 1970449 in software-properties (Ubuntu) "GPG keys are not shown in Software and Updates" [Low, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1970449

 15:14 <jawn-smith> We discussed this last week and decided to not card it until the person who tagged it (julian_k) was available for discussion

 15:14 <bdmurray> There may be a patch

 15:14 <bdmurray> from a deactivated account which is weird

 15:15 <jawn-smith> bdrung: Thanks for volunteering to look at the "patch"

 15:16 <jawn-smith> bug 1981721

 15:16 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:16 <slyon> Same as before, not actionable right now as we're waiting on openstack team input

 15:17 <jawn-smith> right, moving on

 15:17 <jawn-smith> We already discussed 1982562, so skipping that

 15:17 <jawn-smith> bug 1981622

 15:17 <ubottu> Bug 1981622 in systemd (Ubuntu) "mtd device must be supplied (device name is empty)" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981622

 15:17 <jawn-smith> this was the one enr0n wanted to discuss

 15:18 <enr0n> The actual problem here is that the mtdpstore module is not configured quite right in our kernel, so when trying to load the module you get an error printed in dmesg

 15:18 <enr0n> However, that really doesn't impact anything because other pstore backends are available etc.

 15:19 <jawn-smith> It turns out this bug isn't really the cause of the issues the users are seeing

 15:20 <jawn-smith> So is there anything for foundations to fix here? Is the actual bug a foundations issue?

 15:22 <enr0n> I would like to card this so that we don't unnecessarily print this error

 15:22 <jawn-smith> Great, thanks. Let's card it

 15:22 <slyon> will do

 15:23 <jawn-smith> That's it for rls-jj

 15:23 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:23 <jawn-smith> Just one

 15:23 <jawn-smith> bug 1930482

 15:23 <ubottu> Bug 1930482 in systemd (Ubuntu) "netplan crash on ubuntu 20.04 disabling network" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1930482

 15:23 <slyon> this is a crash in systemd-networkd

 15:24 <slyon> I did some initial investigation and might have found the upstream fix. But it should be double checked and possibly staged for Focal SRU

 15:24 <jawn-smith> Okay if it's something that we're going to work on then let's create a card

 15:24 <slyon> enr0n: do we have anything prepared for Focal currently?

 15:25 <enr0n> Yeah, we have a few things staged and I am working on getting a focal SRU ready

 15:25 <enr0n> Not urgently, but in the next couple weeks maybe

 15:25 <slyon> okay so let's card this, and try to include it

 15:25 <enr0n> Sounds good to me

 15:26 <jawn-smith> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:26 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:26 <jawn-smith> ubuntu-meta is with desktop

 15:27 <jawn-smith> usb-creator, lintian, mutt are all waiting on MIRs

 15:27 <jawn-smith> liburi-perl also appears to be waiting on an MIR that is being worked by slyon

 15:28 <slyon> yeah. we might not need an MIR for liburi-perl, but can drop the dependency (or the Debian maintainer might do it for us)

 15:28 <jawn-smith> ubuntu-release-upgrader: any volunteers to look at this one?

 15:29 <jawn-smith> seems like maybe a bdmurray issue

 15:29 <bdrung> FAIL: test upgrade from EOL release to EOL release

 15:29 <bdmurray> that's a network issue, I'll retry it

 15:30 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 15:30 <jawn-smith> I looked into curl a bit

 15:30 <jawn-smith> It's a riscv64 issue. There is a call to some atomic function that isn't supported by gcc on riscv64

 15:30 <jawn-smith> alexghiti, xypron have you seen anything like that before?

 15:31 <alexghiti> Oh I saw a fix for this one not that long ago

 15:31 <jawn-smith> oh cool, would you be interested in looking at curl this week?

 15:31 <alexghiti> Yes I can do that

 15:31 <jawn-smith> Great, thanks

 15:31 <jawn-smith> enr0n can you follow up on systemd?

 15:31 <enr0n> Yes

 15:31 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 15:32 <jawn-smith> golang and ubuntu-image should be mine

 15:32 <jawn-smith> golang has a weird test failure on ppc64el that I need to investigate

 15:32 <jawn-smith> so those are with me

 15:33 <jawn-smith> sqlite3: waveform?

 15:33 <waveform> ack

 15:33 <jawn-smith> Thanks

 15:33 <jawn-smith> git has a few, but based on the architectures some of them could just be retries

 15:33 <jawn-smith> dbungert: git?

 15:33 <dbungert> ack for git

 15:33 <jawn-smith> thanks!

 15:34 <jawn-smith> I'm going to trigger a migration-reference/0 test for astroquery

 15:35 <jawn-smith> lxml has a few regressions, also on architectures that have had some flakiness lately

 15:35 <jawn-smith> xypron: lxml?

 15:36 <xypron> Vacation?

 15:36 <xypron> I will be away the next two weeks

 15:36 <jawn-smith> Ah right, have fun!

 15:36 <jawn-smith> slyon: lxml?

 15:36 <slyon> sure

 15:36 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:37 <jawn-smith> bdrung: can you look into pillow?

 15:37 <bdrung> yes

 15:38 <jawn-smith> Thanks. Now everyone who is in the meeting has a proposed-migration task

 15:38 <vorlon> not me

 15:38 <vorlon> :)

 15:38 <ogayot> jawn-smith: I don't have one yet

 15:38 <jawn-smith> oh whoops

 15:39 <jawn-smith> vorlon: can you take python3-stdlib-extensions failures a-l ?

 15:39 <vorlon> oh Gawd

 15:39 <jawn-smith> and ogayot can take p-z

 15:39 <vorlon> I suppose

 15:40 <ogayot> jawn-smith: ack

 15:41 <jawn-smith> Okay now everyone has one

 15:41 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 15:41 <enr0n> I am out all of next week

 15:46 <bdmurray> jawn-smith: I think that's it

 15:47 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
