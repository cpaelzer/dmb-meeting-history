 15:18 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:18 <slangasek> bdmurray:

 15:18 * doko is leaving early form the meeting, see you later

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1778817 I see is in the general distro lane, should it get prioritized?

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1778817 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu Bionic) "release upgrade from xenial to bionic desktop: screen locks itself, password to unlock fails" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1778817

 15:18 <slangasek> bdmurray: yes

 15:19 <slangasek> sorry, I meant to do that already

 15:19 <bdmurray> and _inhibitIdle isn't doing the right thing for some reason?

 15:19 <slangasek> (done now)

 15:19 <slangasek> bdmurray: evidently not

 15:19 <slangasek> bdmurray: I raised it to willcooke, he was going to assign someone to look at it

 15:20 <bdmurray> slangasek: for which task?

 15:20 * gaughen waves bye to doko

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: that was unclear

 15:22 <bdmurray> rbalint what needs to happen with bug 1778219?

 15:22 <ubottu> bug 1778219 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu) "unattended-upgrades hangs on shutdown, leaves system in a broken state" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1778219

 15:22 <juliank> that should probably use systemd-inhibit too?

 15:23 <rbalint> juliank, how?

 15:23 <rbalint> imo upgrades during shutdown are never tested

 15:25 <juliank> I think it can use systemd inhibitors directly too

 15:25 <rbalint> i'm proposing a piuparts test testing upgrade during shutdown by extending https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=899000

 15:25 <ubottu> Debian bug 899000 in piuparts "piuparts: allow running tests in lxc and VM backends" [Wishlist,Open]

 15:25 <juliank> Not sure how to verify

 15:25 <rbalint> this is for archive-wide coverage

 15:26 <rbalint> bdmurray, the specific fixes include deb-systemd-invoke skipping start during shutdown

 15:26 <rbalint> ... and fixing snapd calling systemctl

 15:27 <bdmurray> Do you we need to open an issue on the forum or whatever about that?

 15:28 <rbalint> bdmurray, i think there is not much to discuss regarding the fixes, but we can ask for volunteers to help fixing the individual packages faster

 15:29 <bdmurray> Okay, what packages need fixing?

 15:29 <bdmurray> Can we get the tasks recorded in the bug?

 15:30 <bdmurray> slangasek: What's going on with bug 1773859?

 15:30 <ubottu> bug 1773859 in systemd-shim (Ubuntu) "upgrades to 18.04 fail" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1773859

 15:30 <rbalint> bdmurray, init-system-helpers for sure, but i can't tell the full set

 15:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: I still have no idea how that system got into that state

 15:31 <slangasek> bdmurray: and I can't reproduce it in a pristine install

 15:31 <gaughen> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/oem-config/+bug/1777900

 15:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1777900 in oem-config (Ubuntu) "oem-config breaks the systemd resolved link for /etc/resolv.conf in 18.04 server " [Undecided,Confirmed]

 15:31 <bdmurray> alright

 15:31 <cyphermox> oh, yay

 15:32 <bdmurray> rbalint: should we search for packages that call systemctl directly?

 15:33 <rbalint> bdmurray, lintian has a check  for that: https://lintian.debian.org/tags/maintainer-script-calls-systemctl.html

 15:33 <rbalint> bdmurray, but there are false positives and negatives there

 15:34 * juliank tested the inhibiting for slangasek's bug, and found that gnome-session-inhibit should work, and adding systemd-inhibit would do nothing

 15:34 <slangasek> bdmurray: ^^

 15:34 <rbalint> bdmurray, piuparts would be more accurate

 15:34 <juliank> (more details in bug comment)

 15:35 <bdmurray> juliank: great, thanks

 15:35 <bdmurray> that's it for bugs today

 15:36 <slangasek> alright

 15:36 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:36 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:36 <bdmurray> I'll be out tomorrow

 15:36 <slangasek> lots of holidays next week

 15:37 <slangasek> Canaday on Monday

 15:37 <slangasek> the 4th of July on the 4th of July

 15:37 <cyphermox> ah?

 15:37 <cyphermox> there's no other name for it?

 15:37 <infinity> slangasek: You should consider moving the 4th of July to the 1st.

 15:37 <cyphermox> USADAY or something

 15:38 <bdmurray> I thought it was Independence Day

 15:38 <slangasek> but no holidays colliding with this meeting on Thursday

 15:38 <infinity> cyphermox: Independence Day, but that's consufing cause it's also a classic film/

 15:38 <slangasek> cyphermox: what bdmurray said

 15:38 <infinity> confusing, too.

 15:38 <cyphermox> infinity: heh, it's a day you can watch that movie and do fireworks and whatever the "Americans" do then

 15:38 <juliank> only confusing if you don't watch independency day on independency day

 15:38 <juliank> ugh, typo

 15:40 <slangasek> #endmeeting
