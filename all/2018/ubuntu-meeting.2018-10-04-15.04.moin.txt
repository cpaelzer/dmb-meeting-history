 15:16 <bdmurray> bug 1783996 is critical - what is the status of the sil2100 ?

 15:17 <cyphermox> wouldn't that be partman's job rather than grub-installer? otherwise we'll warn near the end of the installation instead of around the beginning

 15:17 <sil2100> bdmurray: that is not yet started

 15:17 <doko> ftbfs issues: http://people.canonical.com/~doko/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20180911-cosmic.html

 15:17 <sil2100> bdmurray: but it's not that high priority I think

 15:18 <sil2100> bdmurray: I wanted to take care of it but core18 is a bit more high-priority right now IIRC

 15:18 <bdmurray> sil2100: Okay, so High then?

 15:18 <cyphermox> fwiw, I've been asked to look at slideshow, I'll do that today

 15:19 <sil2100> bdmurray: yeah

 15:19 <sil2100> bdmurray: we shipped bionic with this and it's still better than what was earlier in my opinion

 15:20 <bdmurray> cyphermox: and you were are working on bug 1788727 too?

 15:20 <ubottu> bug 1788727 in grub2 (Ubuntu Cosmic) "upgrade crashing due to unsigned kernels" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1788727

 15:22 <cyphermox> bdmurray: other bugs to discuss?

 15:24 <bdmurray> Is the klibc task in bug 1760106 still necessarY/

 15:25 <bdmurray> I'm not sure how to interpret the "shit" there

 15:26 <xnox> bdmurray, i think i need to upload this.

 15:27 <bdmurray> xnox: okay, should we card it and move it onto the main board?

 15:27 <xnox> bdmurray, yes.

 15:27 <tdaitx> sorry, spotty wifi connection, should be better now

 15:29 <cyphermox> so, aside from that, we have doko saying earlier : plz fix ftbfses, kthxbai

 15:29 <bdmurray> what happened with bug 1793671?

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1793671 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Proprietary drivers are installed locally and not on the target system" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1793671

 15:29 <cyphermox> did we not assign it to someone (not me) to look into?

 15:30 <bdmurray> I seem to recall infinity was going to look at it

 15:30 <bdmurray> I'll check with him later

 15:30 <cyphermox> ok

 15:30 <cyphermox> otherwise I'll try to have a look

 15:32 <tdaitx> should I send my status here or by email?

 15:32 <bdmurray> That's it from me.
