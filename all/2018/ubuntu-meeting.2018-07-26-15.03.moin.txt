 15:16 <infinity> * Fixed, unfixed, and fixed gooder console-setup.

 15:16 <infinity> * SCSI sync fixes for systemd in d-i.

 15:16 <infinity> - 18.04.1:

 15:16 <infinity> * Fixed and unfixed console-setup, need to refix it again.

 15:16 <infinity> * Review sil2100's d-i changes.

 15:16 <infinity> * SCSI sync fixes for systemd in d-i (this isn't at all repetitive).

 15:16 <infinity> * Fixed cdimage publishing code to correctly handle live-server in stables.

 15:16 <infinity> * Hunted down why ppc64el livefs builds were exploding; Colin poked WeBops to fix PPC base image builders, and all should be well now.

 15:18 <tdaitx> * openjdk-10 security update

 15:18 <tdaitx> - tests were disabled, now working as expected

 15:18 <tdaitx> (done)

 15:18 <slangasek> any questions on status?

 15:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything here?

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1783023

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1783023 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Software Updater is sometimes blank when there are ONLY phased updates and auto-removable kernels" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1783023

 15:22 <slangasek> oh there's a bug filed for that thing I saw

 15:22 <bdmurray> yeah, my kid saw it too

 15:23 <rbalint> in kernel removal i coded list them only when there are other updates but did not consider/test phased updates

 15:23 <bdmurray> It seems worth fixing, so we should target it and card it - agreed?

 15:23 <infinity> bdmurray: Yeah, that's definitely a poor uX. :P

 15:23 <slangasek> +1

 15:23 <bdmurray> rbalint: do you have an idea of where to fix it?

 15:24 <rbalint> bdmurray, yes, i just have to check how phased pkgs are handled

 15:24 <bdmurray> rbalint: Could you update the bug then?

 15:24 <rbalint> bdmurray, sure

 15:25 <bdmurray> Then next we have bug 1783328

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1783328 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "The option to select LTS notifications should be masked in non-LTS versions" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1783328

 15:26 <infinity> bdmurray: I'm unsure about that one.  I kinda feel like selecting that on a non-LTS means "upgrade me normally, but when I get to an LTS, stop".

 15:26 <bdmurray> That too seems worth taking - aggree or disagree?

 15:26 <slangasek> yeah, I agree w/ infinity

 15:26 <infinity> bdmurray: But that's probably not how it works, nor is it documented. :P

 15:27 <bdmurray> It doesn't work that way though if you select lts then it checks that meta-release file.

 15:28 <infinity> bdmurray: Sure, but it could check both and be smart.

 15:28 <bdmurray> Okay, so instead of masking it should do the right thing.

 15:29 <slangasek> if we can figure out what the right thing is, yes :)

 15:29 <infinity> It's the thing that isn't wrong.

 15:29 <bdmurray> ;-)

 15:31 <bdmurray> Something like if prompt=lts and you aren't running an lts then upgrade to the next release.

 15:31 * slangasek nods

 15:31 <infinity> +1

 15:31 <bdmurray> So with bug 1782507 I was wondering less about the bug itself but how we know if subiquity was the installer.

 15:31 <ubottu> bug 1782507 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "Mount location of root file system is not as expected" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1782507

 15:33 <bdmurray> Could we improve the apport package hooks so we know if it is subiquity or not?

 15:34 <slangasek> +1

 15:35 <infinity> bdmurray: We sure could.

 15:35 <infinity> Next!

 15:37 <bdmurray> That's it for this week.

 15:38 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:38 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:39 <infinity> I saw rcj's cat's bits.

 15:40 <tdaitx> regarding the installer, perhaps subiquity could keep the curtin cfg it generates (not sure if it does already)

 15:41 <infinity> tdaitx: I think it does save some stuff like that somewhere.  mwhudson and bdmurray and I can take this up further $later.

 15:41 <rcj> infinity: you leave her out of this.

 15:43 <slangasek> #endmeeting
