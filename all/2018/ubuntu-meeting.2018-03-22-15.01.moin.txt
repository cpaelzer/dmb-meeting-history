 15:14 <slangasek> *(db5.3->me)?

 15:17 <slangasek> xnox: heh, that provoked me to look at http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/priority-mismatches.html, and I see something is now trying to pull build-essential into important

 15:17 <slangasek> ok, questions over status?

 15:18 <fginther> xnox, is that python-pyvmomi available in a PPA?

 15:18 <rcj> fginther: bionic should just be in the archive, right?

 15:19 <fginther> right, but I expect it will take a few days to get there

 15:19 <rcj> rmadison says NOW!

 15:19 <fginther> oh, nvm then

 15:19 <slangasek> "a few days" - only in case of errors

 15:20 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:21 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:21 <slangasek> a shorter list than last week, that's nice

 15:21 <bdmurray> there are a couple of new ones

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1755192

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1755192 in software-properties (Ubuntu) "Running add-apt-repository inside docker bionic container gives No such file or directory: 'S.gpg-agent.browser'" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1755192

 15:22 <juliank> nice

 15:22 <juliank> ugh

 15:23 <slangasek> xnox: ^^ sounds like that's related to the gpg rejigger, what does add-apt-repository need?

 15:23 <xnox> fginther, nah, just bionic universe

 15:23 <juliank> it should not need a gpg-agent

 15:23 <xnox> slangasek, yeah, i should look into it.

 15:25 <slangasek> claimed

 15:25 <bdmurray> Does anybody feel like a decision has been made regarding bug 1756446?

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1756446 in whoopsie (Ubuntu) "Include JournalErrors.txt" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1756446

 15:26 <bdmurray> Well, I really mean what JournalErrors.txt should include not sending it to whoopsie.

 15:27 <slangasek> I don't think a decision has been made yet

 15:27 <slangasek> bdmurray: maybe you want to drive the list discussion to a conclusion?

 15:27 <slangasek> I have no strong opinion here; I argued for only including errors based on the filename

 15:28 <bdmurray> Okay maybe I will.

 15:28 <slangasek> ok :)

 15:28 <bdmurray> jibel brought up bug 1756862

 15:28 <ubottu> bug 1756862 in apt-clone (Ubuntu) "upgrade from 17.10 to 18.04 - apt-clone crashed with SystemError in commit(): installArchives() failed" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1756862

 15:29 <bdmurray> Isn't that the ubiquity upgrade code though?

 15:29 <juliank> _something_ failed to install I'd say, it's a traceback in apt-clone

 15:29 <bdmurray> Didn't I talk about dropping it at one point in time?

 15:29 <slangasek> I don't recall

 15:30 * juliank does not see the need for it

 15:30 <slangasek> it does seem to be via the ubiquity upgrade option

 15:30 <xnox> i'm up for dropping that too....

 15:30 <bdmurray> xnox: I think it was to you I mentioned dropping it

 15:30 <slangasek> at one point, ubiquity's upgrade option was the best way to cross-migrate from i386 to amd64

 15:30 <xnox> hahahhaha

 15:31 <juliank> just hide the button in the UI file -> problem solved :D

 15:31 <xnox> slangasek, and soon to cross-migrate from amd64 to arm64, right? wait, no, one needs a new laptop

 15:31 <slangasek> yeah, I was going to say that if the option is broken it's better to hide it

 15:31 <slangasek> but I think it's worth a little bit of effort to see what's happening here

 15:31 <slangasek> xnox: but the disk interfaces are the same ;)

 15:33 <juliank> we need a better hook to add term.log and friends for apt-clone I think...

 15:33 <bdmurray> that's all I wanted to raise

 15:33 <slangasek> xnox: do you think we should take LP: #1742903?  (do you agree with the bug?)

 15:33 <bdmurray> juliank: that'd be good I'm not certain how to detect ubiquity upgrades though

 15:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1742903 in intel-microcode (Ubuntu) "Microcode updates require a reboot to apply, but package postinst doesn't touch /run/reboot-required" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1742903

 15:33 <xnox> slangasek, yes.

 15:34 <slangasek> ok, taking

 15:34 <xnox> slangasek, but it may need to be more smart; e.g. check the new microcode revisions vs currently loaded; to see if there was an update to microcode for this system, actually.

 15:34 <slangasek> anything else from that list today?

 15:34 <slangasek> xnox: ok please put that comment on the bug?

 15:35 <bdmurray> I think we should just pass on 1749546 again

 15:35 <juliank> xnox: Even a dumb one is better than none...

 15:35 <juliank> :D

 15:35 <bdmurray> Oh I mean 1631098

 15:36 <juliank> but would be nice

 15:36 <slangasek> bdmurray: if there are no other bug reports coming in right now about it, yeah, seems reasonable to punt

 15:36 <slangasek> bdmurray: at least it probably shouldn't be on our "must be done for 18.04" list?

 15:37 <slangasek> perhaps I should put it on trello and we can drop it from the release tracking list?

 15:37 <rbalint> imo errors=replace would be better

 15:37 <juliank> abythubg is better than ignore

 15:38 <slangasek> juliank's text brought to you by errors=transpose

 15:38 <rbalint> slangasek: i replied but it was buggy, thus dropped :-(

 15:40 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:40 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:41 <bdmurray> nope

 15:42 <slangasek> #endmeeting
