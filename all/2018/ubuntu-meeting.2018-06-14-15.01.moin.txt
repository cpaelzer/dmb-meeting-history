 15:16 <gaughen> I love the rainbow.

 15:16 <gaughen> that is all.

 15:17 <slangasek> :)

 15:18 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:19 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything that warrants discussing here?

 15:19 <bdmurray> jibel brought up bug 1768230

 15:19 <ubottu> bug 1768230 in initramfs-tools (Ubuntu) "Long time booting : Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to device scanning." [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1768230

 15:20 <xnox> the answer is switch to dracut, use systemd in initrd, such that we can launch lvmetad daemon

 15:20 <xnox> i'm sure slangasek is down with that

 15:20 <slangasek> I'm sorry I wasn't listening I was sharpening this shiv

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: how about if I take that one to look at

 15:22 <bdmurray> slangasek: sounds good, that might be my issue if that helps

 15:22 <slangasek> ok

 15:23 <bdmurray> slangasek: that's it from me

 15:23 <slangasek> alright

 15:23 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:23 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:24 <doko> proposed ...

 15:24 <doko> ... is a mess

 15:24 <slangasek> yes

 15:24 <doko> should we disable autosyncs for a while? only makes sense if people are committing to clean up things

 15:25 <xnox> doko, true that

 15:25 <xnox> doko, hold hostage, until bonuses are done.

 15:25 <slangasek> doko: any pointers regarding what needs looked at currently?

 15:25 <cyphermox> haskell

 15:25 <cyphermox> ?

 15:26 <doko> it's r-base, openmpi, haskell

 15:26 <doko> and probably more

 15:26 <slangasek> ugh

 15:26 <slangasek> can we remove haskell?

 15:26 <cyphermox> if anyone has more knowledge of {haskell U crypto U alignment}

 15:26 <doko> isn't the transition tracker wirtten in hascall?

 15:26 <doko> or was that ocaml

 15:27 <slangasek> ocaml

 15:27 <slangasek> but I'm ok with removing that too ;)

 15:29 <slangasek> so it sounds like I'll plan to do some digging into haskell crypto armhf today

 15:29 <cyphermox> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=901406

 15:29 <ubottu> Debian bug 901406 in src:haskell-cipher-aes "haskell-cipher-aes: unaligned access on arm64 kernel (armhf binary) segfauts during testsuite" [Serious,Open]

 15:29 <doko> and ginggs already requested to remove some openmpi stuff for armhf

 15:32 <xnox> slangasek, https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/mem_alignment i thought /proc/cpu/alignment should work, no?

 15:32 <slangasek> last call

 15:32 <slangasek> vorlon@rugby:~$ cat /proc/cpu/alignment

 15:32 <slangasek> cat: /proc/cpu/alignment: No such file or directory

 15:32 <slangasek> xnox: ^^ :P

 15:32 <slangasek> not present on our arm64 kernels

 15:32 <slangasek> which is where the SIGBUS happens

 15:33 <cjwatson> yeah that's a 32-bit-only thing

 15:33 <cjwatson> compare https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-buildd/+bug/1516331

 15:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1516331 in launchpad-buildd "please set /proc/cpu/alignment=4 on Launchpad ARM buildd kernels" [Undecided,Fix released]

 15:33 <slangasek> the problem is the chips really don't want to help you with this given that 32-bit is a compatibility mode

 15:33 <xnox> slangasek, and i guess kernel cmdline alignment= wouldn't work either?!

 15:33 <rbalint> r-cran-memoise may crash in autopkgtest for the same reason

 15:33 <rbalint> on armhf

 15:33 <slangasek> and thus the kernel doesn't have an implementation for trapping+fixup either AFAIK

 15:34 <slangasek> anyway, to be investigated

 15:34 <slangasek> rbalint: R is on its own

 15:34 <slangasek> :)

 15:34 <cyphermox> slangasek: fwiw, both cryptonite and cipher-aes are in my homedir, if you want to have a look

 15:34 <slangasek> cyphermox: ack, thanks

 15:34 <cyphermox> (and built/building so we can just run tests)

 15:35 <slangasek> #endmeeting
