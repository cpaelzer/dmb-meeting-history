 15:09 <slangasek> bdmurray: speaking of package team mappings, kernel team said yes to ocl-icd and khronos-opencl-headers, correct?  I notice they're still unsubscribed

 15:09 <slangasek> (which I can notice as a glance, now that he unsubscribed list is so short!)

 15:09 <gaughen> y

 15:10 <bdmurray> slangasek: I did subscribe them

 15:10 <gaughen> slangasek, is there still a boost on there?

 15:10 <slangasek> yes

 15:10 <slangasek> is something not regenerating?

 15:10 <bdmurray> what are you looking at?

 15:10 <gaughen> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html

 15:10 <bdmurray> gaughen: you aren't slangasek

 15:11 <gaughen> duh, but that's what I'm looking at

 15:14 <juliank> * found a bug in apt that causes it to stop pipelining in future connections once a server responds with Connection: close (archive.u.c does that every 101 requests, thus only 101 packages are pipelined). PoC fix

 15:17 <bdmurray> no mwhudson

 15:18 <slangasek> any questions on status?

 15:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray:

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1745664 is supposedly a regression

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1745664 in systemd (Ubuntu) "[regression] systemd-logind crashed with SIGABRT in __libc_connect() from __GI_clnttcp_create() from __GI___libc_rpc_getport() from __GI_pmap_getport() from __GI_clnttcp_create()" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1745664

 15:22 <slangasek> NIS?

 15:24 <bdmurray> Is it the same as bug 1774417

 15:24 <ubottu> bug 1774417 in nis (Ubuntu) "systemd-logind: do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to send; errno = Operation not permitted" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1774417

 15:25 <slangasek> possibly

 15:26 <slangasek> I'm doubtful that we should prioritize this

 15:26 <slangasek> NIS is broadly obsolete and insecure and we don't exercise it

 15:28 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay

 15:29 <bdmurray> then bug 1785723

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1785723 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Memory leak in systemd-journald" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1785723

 15:29 <slangasek> xnox, rbalint: ^^ ?

 15:30 <xnox> hm

 15:30 <gaughen> I have a bug too to chat about

 15:30 <gaughen> when you're ready

 15:30 <xnox> journalctl --flush

 15:31 <xnox> should help to clear things, so comparing after a flush would be useful.

 15:31 * xnox can check if it is leaking on e.g. my machine...

 15:32 <rbalint> i'm not sure if this is an actual leak but i'd be +1 on taking it and at lease provide workarounds

 15:32 <slangasek> ok, pulling into the backlog

 15:32 <gaughen> slangasek, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nodejs/+bug/1779863

 15:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1779863 in nodejs (Ubuntu Cosmic) "Ubuntu nodejs package isn't ABI compatible with mainline nodejs." [Medium,In progress]

 15:32 <gaughen> slangasek, I know this caused strong views, but it is still sitting out there

 15:32 <slangasek> gaughen: that required a reupload and was in the unapproved queue awaiting re-review, last I checked

 15:33 <slangasek> gaughen: I had accepted and then it FTBFS because it was one of these annoying packages with a testsuite that embeds SSL certificates with expiration dates

 15:33 <gaughen> k, so ddstreet the nodejs bug above is waiting on you to rebase, correct?

 15:33 <slangasek> so any SRU team member can re-review

 15:33 <slangasek> no, it's not waiting on him

 15:34 <gaughen> oh okay

 15:34 <ddstreet> gaughen i rebased and reuploaded it 8/14

 15:34 <ddstreet> it's been waiting on slangasek since then

 15:34 <gaughen> I'm slow, and not reading all of slangasek's words

 15:34 <gaughen> bdmurray, would you do a re-review please?

 15:35 <slangasek> it's been waiting on the SRU team, not on me personally :)

 15:35 <gaughen> look slangasek it's hard to read ALL your words

 15:35 <bdmurray> gaughen: okay

 15:35 <gaughen> thank you!

 15:36 <slangasek> any other bugs?

 15:36 <bdmurray> Odd_Bloke: is bug 1727751 important to you?

 15:36 <ubottu> bug 1727751 in distro-info (Ubuntu) "ubuntu-distro-info shows the current development series as "latest development" and "supported stable version" at the same time" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1727751

 15:38 <slangasek> win 37

 15:38 <slangasek> aaaaaa

 15:41 <Odd_Bloke> bdmurray: Not especially.

 15:41 <bdmurray> Odd_Bloke: okay

 15:42 <bdmurray> that's it from me then

 15:43 <xnox> slangasek, rbalint - i think it is leaky, restart of journald results in 35M -> 1M ram usage for me, as per $ systemctl status systemd-journald

 15:43 <slangasek> xnox: cool; it's in the systemd trello backlog for you to prioritize :)

 15:43 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:43 <slangasek> anything else?
