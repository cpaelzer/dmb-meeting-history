 20:03 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Feb  1 20:03:44 2018 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:03 <meetingology>

 20:04 <wxl> \o\

 20:04 <wxl> /o/

 20:04 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:04 <popey> Hello one, hello all!

 20:04 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:04 <davecore> Hi everyone

 20:05 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:05 <neothethird> hey everyone \o

 20:05 <tsimonq2> heyoo

 20:05 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:05 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:07 <neothethird> Should I start then?

 20:07 <popey> Go for it.

 20:07 <Wild_Man> #topic neothethird

 20:07 <neothethird> Hey everyone, my name is Jan Sprinz (neothethird), i'm a 20 year old informatics student from Germany currently living in Munich. I only really started using Ubuntu on the desktop in 2016. Having the power of an actual GNU/Linux terminal (not the crippled experience you have on macOS) was a real eye-opener to me, and the Unity user experience turned out to be everything I ever wanted from my desktop.

 20:07 <neothethird> I started to contribute by reporting bugs and giving support on askubuntu, and came accross the Ubuntu Phone project. The concept of convergence blew my mind and decided i wanted to help making it a reality. Since the commercial devices were very hard to come by at that time, i started exploring other options.

 20:07 <neothethird> I discovered Marius Gripsgard and his UBports project, who were trying to port to the Fairphone 2, the phone I was using. Porting was beyond my ken, but I tried to help in other parts of the project, like the websites, PR, organizational stuff, and of course testing and reporting bugs. With the Fariphone port becoming more mature, i also started to look into qml app-development.

 20:08 <neothethird> I was studying game engineering at that time, sounds interesting, but it's really not. I was bored out of my mind and Ubuntu Touch was a welcome distraction. When Canonical announced the end of their support for phones, the whole community was in shock. It was clear pretty quickly that if someone was going to take it over, it would be UBports, since we already had the infrastructure. So we did, and the response in th

 20:08 <Wild_Man> neothethird , please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:08 <neothethird> e community was overwhelmingly positive! I took up a lot of tasks related to the takeover and was later elected for the first Board of Directors of the soon-to-be-active UBports Foundation.

 20:08 <neothethird> My current areas of contributions are listed on my Wiki page (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JanSprinz). I love the Ubuntu community, and I hope you will look favorably upon my application for Ubuntu Membership. Ubuntu is a big part of my life, even though UBports is technically not an official Ubuntu project. If you want me to elaborate on

 20:08 <neothethird> UBports Foundation members list: https://ubports.com/foundation/ubports-foundation/foundation-boardmembers

 20:09 <popey> neothethird: how has the reception of ubports taking over from canonical in ownership of the ubuntu phone projects?

 20:10 <neothethird> Reception by whom specifically?

 20:11 <popey> The wider community :)

 20:11 <popey> In general, nobody specifically.

 20:12 <neothethird> I would say it was mixed. The already present UBports community on telegram was very positive about it, some people who did not know us before were a little sceptical at first. Not only because they did not know us, also because it takes a lot of faith to trust someone with something as personal as your mobile phone operating system.

 20:13 <neothethird> And some people may have had the impression that it was a "grab for power" by UBports, but i think that feeling is no longer there. (at least i don't hear it any more)

 20:14 <popey> Yeah, it seems you've handled that weell

 20:14 <popey> *well

 20:14 <neothethird> thank you

 20:14 <Wild_Man> neothethird, how often do you help out on Ask Ubuntu?

 20:14 <popey> With updates coming out too, which is always good to see.

 20:14 <neothethird> Wild_Man: less today, unfortunately, because i am so tied in in Ubuntu Touch, and Ubuntu Touch questions are not welcome on askubuntu any more.

 20:15 <popey> Really? Shame. Do you have an alternative Q&A site?

 20:15 <Wild_Man> Okay that makes sense. Thanks

 20:16 <neothethird> popey: we have forums.ubports.com, but most technical support goes through Telegram or GitHub.

 20:16 <popey> Gotcha

 20:16 <tsimonq2> neothethird: So I see on your wiki you want to help UBPorts become a better part of Ubuntu. What do you see as the differences and how do you plan to help achieve that goal??

 20:16 * tsimonq2 is on mobile, excuse typos

 20:17 <tsimonq2> (I'm looking at "Future Goals" if anyone wants to follow along :))

 20:18 <neothethird> tsimonq2: Some former Ubuntu Phone users still have not heard about us, i hope that will change in the future. I still see "Oh, i thought it was dead" at least once a week.

 20:19 <tsimonq2> neothethird: And how do you plan on getting that info out? (And how can the Ubuntu community help you?))

 20:19 <neothethird> tsimonq2: How do I want to help achieve that goal? That's a difficult one. It also depends on what the Ubuntu community will like and not like.

 20:19 <wxl> is there someway that could be advertised through an OTA or something of the sort?

 20:20 <tsimonq2> ^

 20:20 <neothethird> tsimonq2: With the switch of base to xenial coming along, i could imagine starting a process of making Ubuntu Touch an official flavor, for example. That might be one option.

 20:21 <tsimonq2> neothethird: I would be curious to see if that's possible :D

 20:21 <wxl> an official flavor would be great!

 20:21 <wxl> i wholeheartedly support that

 20:21 <tsimonq2> I totally agree

 20:21 <neothethird> wxl: We released three OTAs already, the next one (as it's planned) will introduce the new xenial base. For that we want to definitely spin up PR

 20:21 <tsimonq2> Anyways, that's all I have to ask :)

 20:21 <popey> I have no more questions

 20:22 <wxl> neothethird: well, i'm suggesting the OTA itself, when announcing itself, could also link to UBPorts info, or are you saying that's not applicable to non-UBPorts Ubuntu Phone users?

 20:23 <wxl> in any case, we can continue this conversation outside of this meeting. i have no other questions

 20:23 <neothethird> wxl: With the Ubuntu Store being decomissioned now, i don't know if there are still non-ubports ubuntu touch users around. We support all devices that canonical supported before.

 20:24 <popey> (i still have my bq m10 running ubports :) )

 20:26 <wxl> congrats, neothethird.

 20:26 <pleia2> you're up, diddledan! please introduce yourself :)

 20:26 <diddledan> Hi, I'm Dan, and have been contributing to the snapcraft community for some time, since at least the beginning of 2017. I am avidly active on their forums. I'm in my 30s, have had a computer since I was 3 (family system) and developed a love for computing through this exposure. I have been friends with Alan (popey) for many years through interaction via the UK LoCo. I am currently working freelance as a

 20:26 <diddledan> WordPress developer, contributing as much as I can to the snapcraft community in my spare time. I have used Ubuntu since the 2005 era (5.04). I was encouraged to apply for Ubuntu membership by Wimpy (flexiondotorg) who I've been getting to know well through my contributions to snapcraft. My wiki page is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/diddledan.

 20:27 <popey> (my opinion is covered by my testimonial)

 20:28 <wxl> man, you are just snapperific, aren't you?

 20:28 <diddledan> I hope so :-)

 20:28 <pleia2> wow, lots of snaps

 20:28 <wxl> i must add a snap of audacity seems audacious. good work!

 20:28 <diddledan> it's on the buildd now

 20:28 <wxl> gimp, too, wow

 20:29 <wxl> and of course those testimonials go a long way

 20:29 <wxl> omg you helped bring a powershell snap? jeeez

 20:29 <wxl> wow, ok, i've got no questions at all

 20:29 <popey> I'm impressed with diddledan's involvement in the forum. getting stuck in answering technical questions and proposing fixes for challenging problems

 20:29 <diddledan> yeah, I'm at the snapcraft summit, and on the monday I spent the day with the guy from MS

 20:30 <Wild_Man> impressive

 20:35 <Wild_Man> davecore, your up

 20:35 <popey> *now

 20:35 <davecore> Hi, my name is David Coronel and I joined Canonical in May 2016 as a Technical Account Manager in the Support & Technical Services team. I have over 12 years of sysadmin experience and am driven by new cloud technologies and platforms. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/davecore

 20:35 <davecore> I particularly want to see Ubuntu strive in the public cloud space. I'm a member and contributor to Launchpad since April 2016.

 20:35 <davecore> I made a contribution to the upstream sosreport hardware module and actively participate in testing of packages in -proposed. Recently in Launchpad bugs 1734983, 1742531 and 1743232.

 20:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1742531 in Landscape Client "New Amazon AWS C5 instances are not recognised as a VM" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1742531

 20:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1743232 in Landscape Client "set vm_info to kvm for digitalocean instances" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1743232

 20:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1734983 in sosreport (Debian) "Request to backport sosreport v3.5" [Unknown,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1734983

 20:36 <davecore> I also made a contribution to the private project Landscape server and went through the merge request and testing process in Launchpad. I was encouraged to apply for membership by slashd.

 20:36 <davecore> I really like to learn about and work with new technologies. I achieved the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associatem, Certified OpenStack Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Administrator in the last 2 years.

 20:36 <markthomas> I am also here to support davecore's application.

 20:36 <pleia2> I see a lot of internal work here (landscape, canonical support), is there more that you can point to that's public?

 20:38 <davecore> pleia2: I did some recent testing with sosreport , namely  https://launchpad.net/bugs/1734983

 20:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1734983 in sosreport (Debian) "Request to backport sosreport v3.5" [Unknown,New]

 20:38 <slashd> pleia2, davecore is doing some launchpad work, sosreport upstream patches, he contribute in ubuntu in various way due to the nature of his work for Canonical. I support his application too.

 20:38 <slashd> sosreport ubuntuplugin upstream work I must say ^

 20:38 <pleia2> I'm just asking because community involvement is key here, so we want to know where we would have worked with you :)

 20:39 <davecore> pleia2: I go to local events in Montreal, such as devops meetup. I used to be involved in Ansible when it wasn't acquired by Red Hat. :)

 20:39 <slashd> pleia2, As a ubuntu uploader myself I often rely on davecore skill to test and provide good testing feedback, and he is very good at identify and finding problem in ubuntu and explain them in lp

 20:40 <slashd> and fix them when possible.

 20:40 <davecore> pleia2: I hosted Ansible Meetup events and invited the Ansible VP of community to visit us in our first Montreal event

 20:41 <davecore> As a TAM at Canonical, I get the chance to work with some of the major public cloud vendors and strive to make Ubuntu better in the public cloud space.

 20:44 <popey> I'd like to see more evidence of community contributions personally.

 20:44 <popey> It's difficult to tell if we're just not seeing them from the wiki page as is

 20:45 <popey> or if the majority of contributions have been to commercial non-community facing projects

 20:46 <davecore> I've been a teaching assistant for a python class in the Montreal Python community

 20:47 <slashd> popey, here's one public contribution davecore did -> https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/26502396/

 20:47 <slashd> for sosreport affecting lds-client for instance in this case if not mistaken ^

 20:47 <popey> Thanks, but the guidance for membership is 'sustained and significant' contributions

 20:47 <popey> not 'here is one'

 20:48 <davecore> I think my primary channel of working on making Ubuntu succeed is through my TAM role at Canonical, but I still work in the big picture towards making Ubuntu the best OS it can be, even though that's behind the curtains a little.

 20:49 <pleia2> davecore: don't get me wrong, I appreciate the work you do behind the curtains, but I feel an important part of membership is the community side of things (that's why all Canonical engineers aren't automatically members)

 20:50 <tsimonq2> ^

 20:50 <popey> yeah, same

 20:50 <wxl> or at least with clear documentation of what has been done

 20:50 <tsimonq2> Right.

 20:50 <wxl> elaborate on where behind the curtains it is

 20:50 <wxl> provide links, etc.

 20:50 <markthomas> So, we will build out the documentation a bit and davecore will try again.

 20:50 <pleia2> markthomas: sounds good, thanks for coming :)

 20:50 <davecore> Understood, thank you for your time and consideration. I'll work on the community aspect.

 20:51 <tsimonq2> Thanks for coming :)

 20:51 <wxl> thanks davecore!

 20:51 <Wild_Man> cboltz, your up

 20:51 <cboltz> Hi, I'm Christian Boltz and live in a small village in the Palatinate, Germany

 20:51 <cboltz> The most surprising thing first - I don't use Ubuntu ;-)

 20:51 <cboltz> I contribute to AppArmor (first bzr commit on April 1st 2011) and therefore apply (mostly) as upstream contributor

 20:51 <cboltz> (you probably know that AppArmor is an important tool to make your system in general, and especially snaps secure)

 20:51 <cboltz> The "biggest" thing I did was leading (as mentor) a GSoC project to rewrite aa-logprof etc. Since then, I also maintain the aa-* tools etc.

 20:51 <cboltz> (before we moved the code to gitlab, I even managed to be the top contributor for AppArmor on launchpad ;-)

 20:51 <cboltz> I also maintain some of the AppArmor profiles since years, and help with AppArmor-related bugreports of Debian, Ubuntu and openSUSE.

 20:51 <cboltz> Needless to say that I plan to continue my work on AppArmor ;-)

 20:51 <cboltz> I won't mention all the details here - just have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChristianBoltz ;-)

 20:51 <cboltz> Oh, and you should probably have a look at the newest slide from my "AppArmor Crash Course" talk which I gave at several conferences: http://paste.opensuse.org/9438a50c (did I already mention that I find each and every bug? ;-)

 20:52 <cboltz> BTW: sarnold, sbeattie - please don't tell John about this. If I get accepted, I'd like to surprise him at FOSDEM ;-)

 20:53 <sarnold> cboltz: ha! This is awesome :)

 20:53 * sbeattie vouches for cboltz; he's done a lot of work upstream and responding to ubuntu apparmor bug reports.

 20:55 <pleia2> cboltz: would you say bug reports are the only way you interact with the Ubuntu community directly?

 20:55 <sarnold> fully agreed, cboltz's contributions to AppArmor, and the AppArmor communities in Ubuntu and Debian is legendary :)

 20:55 <wxl> weird question, cboltz: as someone who seems to sort of "lives" outside the ubuntu community, why do you want an ubuntu membership?

 20:56 <cboltz> pleia2: for interaction with the Ubuntu community, helping in bugreports is probably the biggest part

 20:56 <cboltz> wxl: what about "because I can" (at least I hope so ;-)

 20:56 <cboltz> more seriously - I'm a cross-distribution person

 20:56 <wxl> i also note cboltz is very active on apparmor@lists.ubuntu.com which is not necessarily ubuntu-specific

 20:57 <pleia2> ah, a mailing list too, that's good

 20:58 <wxl> i find apparmor just confusing

 20:58 <sarnold> and apparmor tool development, apparmor profile development, apparmor documentation ..

 20:58 <pleia2> wxl: hehe

 20:58 <wxl> like, as far as where all the resources are

 20:58 <wxl> like it *SEEMS* like the launchpad project is the main source, but i'm not entirely sure

 20:59 <pleia2> sarnold: I guess I can ask you this ;) is there a lot of Ubuntu-specific work that goes into that?

 20:59 <cboltz> the code moved to gitlab.com some months ago

 20:59 <cboltz> bugreports and releases still live on launchpad

 20:59 <wxl> right. confusing :)

 20:59 <pleia2> we have tens of thousands of people who could call themselves upstream contributors, but we're looking for ubuntu-specific work when it comes to membership

 21:00 <sarnold> pleia2: the profiles certainly have ubuntu-specific aspects, a large amount of work goes into figuring out what is appropriate "shared" content for profiles among all distros, what is specific to ubuntu, what is specific to debian, what is specific to debian family of distributions, what's specific to suse, etc.

 21:01 <pleia2> that's the impression I had, thank you

 21:01 <cboltz> pleia2: I see your point, but - and this is probably not the answer you are looking for - the perfect work is something that is useful for *all* distributions

 21:01 <pleia2> cboltz: oh I agree :)

 21:02 <cboltz> that of course includes Ubuntu, but it's pointless to fix a bug only for Ubuntu and keep it everywhere else ;-)

 21:02 <pleia2> indeed (I came to Ubuntu myself after doing packaging in Debian)

 21:03 <sbeattie> cboltz: have you edited anything in the ubuntu wiki besides your membership application? I have a vague recollection of you doing so, but may be mis-remembering (and I can't remember how to get the wiki to show me)
