 16:31 <ratliff> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:31 <ratliff> jdstrand: you're up

 16:32 <jdstrand> hi!

 16:32 <jdstrand> This is a short week for me (off friday and all next week). This week I plan to work on:

 16:32 <jdstrand> * snapd PR reviews

 16:32 <jdstrand> * go through the anbox design and think through what proper confinement might look like

 16:32 <jdstrand> * iterate on last open PR (udev trigger)

 16:32 <jdstrand> that's it from me. mdeslaur, you're up

 16:32 <jdstrand> * adjust snap-confine to always use a device cgroup

 16:32 <jdstrand> * pick up review-tools snap USNs phase1/part ii work as have time

 16:32 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:33 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on a massive imagemagick update

 16:33 <mdeslaur> if anyone wants to help test, packages are building in the security team proposed PPA

 16:33 <mdeslaur> I'm also working on en embargoed issue

 16:33 <mdeslaur> and I'll pick something else from the list after that

 16:33 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 16:33 <mdeslaur> sbeattie?

 16:33 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:34 <sbeattie> I'm currently working on gnupg/gnupg2 updates

 16:34 <sbeattie> (they're also available in the security team proposed PPA for testing)

 16:34 <sbeattie> kernel updates are in the process of being published, will be publishing USNs for those

 16:35 <sbeattie> I also have amd64-microcode updates to publish once the kernel is out the door

 16:35 <sbeattie> after that, I have a couple of internal tasks to taek on.

 16:35 <sbeattie> That will probably consume my week.

 16:36 <sbeattie> jjohansen: over to you

 16:36 <jjohansen> I need to get my upstream kernel apparmor pull request out this morning, it was delayed last week because of the idr patch

 16:37 <jjohansen> and then I really need to focus on apparmor 3, specifically the feature subsetting so that we correctly compile versioned policy to what the kernel supports

 16:38 <jjohansen> if I get that done, I will move on to what ever other misc apparmor 3 issues need addressed so we can kick it out next week

 16:38 <jjohansen> sarnold: you are up

 16:38 <sarnold> I'm on community this week

 16:38 <sarnold> working down the list of MIRs, fprintd and .. related package .. and need to submit presentation topic to debconf

 16:38 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:39 <sarnold> (oh yes, reviewing john's patches if he feels it useful)

 16:39 <chrisccoulson> I'm currently working on a firefox update

 16:39 <chrisccoulson> the thunderbird update I was expecting still hasn't happened, so I'll have to do that if it does

 16:40 <chrisccoulson> I triaged all of the spidermonkey CVEs at the end of last week, and I'll probably do an update for that this week

 16:40 <chrisccoulson> other than that, I'm still working on getting thunderbird 60 packages building

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> I hope I'll have enough time after that to do something else, as it's .... *drum roll* .... rust updates next week

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:42 <ratliff> I'm in the happy place this week.

 16:43 <ratliff> This week will be dedicated to internal work. When I get a few spare minutes I will work on triaging wireshark CVEs to ensure they show the actual state.

 16:43 <ratliff> leosilva: on to you

 16:43 <leosilva> I'm bug-triage this week.

 16:43 <leosilva> I'm working on ruby updates.

 16:44 <leosilva> I'll also do some cve- searching after ruby to pick other updates

 16:44 <leosilva> ratliff: it's back to you.

 16:44 <ratliff> thanks, leosilva!

 16:44 <ratliff> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:44 <ratliff> The Ubuntu Security team suggests that contributors look into merging Debian security updates in community-supported packages. If you would like to help Ubuntu but are not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:44 <ratliff> See http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/ for available merges and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details on preparing Ubuntu security updates. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-hardened. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 16:44 <ratliff> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 16:44 <ratliff> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:46 <ratliff> jdstrand, mdeslaur, sbeattie, jjohansen, sarnold, chrisccoulson, leosilva: Thanks!
