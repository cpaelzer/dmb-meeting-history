 16:08 <Daviey> jamespage: I believe not

 16:08 <rbasak> I spoke to the kernel team at their sprint. AIUI, we (server team) need to fix the relevant packages. I think we need to improve the messaging over defaults and things, which I will follow up on.

 16:08 <smb> jamespage, Not that we agreed more that telling you they are broken (or better jibl does)

 16:08 <jamespage> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/DKMS/view/Precise%20Proposed%20-generic-lts-raring/

 16:08 <jamespage> they are broken

 16:09 <jamespage> OK _ I'll pickup openvswitch is someone else can grab iscsitarget

 16:10 <smb> jamespage, I am pretty sure I did update openvswitch

 16:10 <jamespage> smb, for the 3.11 kernel in saucy right?

 16:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1156932 in python-novaclient (Ubuntu Saucy) "User can't modify security-group-rule via nova-api if there are duplicated security group name" [High,Confirmed]

 16:21 <arosales> zul,  ^

 16:21 <arosales> looks confirmed

 16:21 <arosales> but not certain what the current status is for Saucy

 16:21 <arosales> actually needs an owner

 16:22 <arosales> zul, would that be something you can look into?

 16:22 <zul> arosales:  erm...yeah

 16:23 <arosales> zul, feel free to pass or reassign if necessary. Just thought it should have an owner with the tags and priority on the bug.

 16:23 <arosales> zul, thanks

 16:24 <jamespage> that needs a merge from debian

 16:25 <jamespage> any volunteers?

 16:25 <jamespage> I'd leave the aarch64 updates for the reporter :-)

 16:25 <arosales> rbasak, your sharpening your debian skills right

 16:25 <arosales> :-)

 16:25 <rbasak> I'd love to do it, but I'm concerned that I have too much on my todo list right now, and won't get round to it.

 16:26 <jamespage> OK - I'll stick it on my list for this week - I've done it a few times now

 16:26 <jamespage> that should keep the overheads down

 16:26 <arosales> jamespage, thanks

 16:26 <jamespage> if I disappear for any reason someone else can pick it up

 16:26 <arosales> jamespage, sounds good

 16:27 <zul> jamespage:  just stick your todo list somewhere before you go

 16:27 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1208455

 16:27 <jamespage> zul, ok

 16:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1208455 in linux (Ubuntu Saucy) "general protection fault running apt-get inside double nested kvm VM" [High,In progress]

 16:27 <arosales> no owner for saucy

 16:27 <arosales> hallyn_, any suggestions ^

 16:27 <hallyn_> arosales: it's a kernel bug, i'd expect jsalisbury or smb would be interested int aking it

 16:28 <smb> I think we were sort of waiting for james hunt

 16:28 <smb> Now that 3.11 hit the archive he may test with all 3 on 3.11

 16:29 <arosales> smb, thnks, sounds like it is still moving

 16:29 <hallyn_> arosales: i generally find those bugs don't need an owner next to them for kernel team to watch them closely, fwiw

 16:29 * arosales will finish up the medium bugs and then we can move on. Just wanted to step through the bugs as we approach FF.

 16:29 <arosales> hallyn_, ack thanks

 16:29 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-quantumclient/+bug/1170849

 16:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1170849 in python-quantumclient (Ubuntu Saucy) "Cliff 1.3.2 is not available " [Medium,Triaged]

 16:30 <arosales> looks like adam_g commented here

 16:30 <arosales> troubles reproducing, awaiting reporter feedback

 16:30 <arosales> hmm

 16:30 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvswitch/+bug/1189408

 16:30 <jamespage> its a trunk testing PPA bug - marked invalid

 16:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1189408 in openvswitch (Ubuntu) "1.10 FTBFS on powerpc (lacp test failure)" [Medium,New]

 16:31 <arosales> I thought powerpc was gonig away

 16:31 <jamespage> arosales, thats non critical - I took the saucy task off just now

 16:31 <hallyn_> i think it's coming back :)

 16:31 <arosales> jamespage, thanks on both bugs

 16:31 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.5/+bug/1203828

 16:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1203828 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Saucy) "mysql 5.5.32, 5.1.70 security update tracking bug" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:32 <arosales> do these get picked up auto-magically or do we need some one to manually intervene for Saucy?

 16:32 * arosales wonder if the security team picks these up. . .  .

 16:32 <jamespage> they do

 16:32 <rbasak> I think so. They just fall into our triage list.

 16:32 <arosales> ack

 16:32 <arosales> that closes out the medium or >

 16:33 <arosales> thanks for stepping through that :-)

 16:34 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms-ha-v2

 16:34 <jamespage> alot of that is in progress or done

 16:34 * arosales hitting red BPs

 16:34 <arosales> jamespage, thanks

 16:35 <arosales> 0%

 16:35 <arosales> zul, ^

 16:35 <zul> gah i need to update that

 16:35 <arosales> zul ok thanks

 16:35 <hallyn_> arosales: remind me, are these things being measured against completion in august, or in october?

 16:36 <arosales> hallyn_, October

 16:36 <hallyn_> ok

 16:36 <arosales> at least that is what the series goal is set to

 16:36 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-hypervisor

 16:36 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-ceph

 16:36 <arosales> sorry wrong paste

 16:37 <arosales> jamespage, looks like cep is on track for August

 16:37 <jamespage> arosales, looking OK

 16:37 <jamespage> dumping rc in saucy

 16:37 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-webscale ok too?

 16:37 <jamespage> that sounds odd

 16:37 <jamespage> arosales, no

 16:37 <arosales> ya got a couple blocked

 16:37 <arosales> sorry nginx is blocked

 16:37 <jamespage> arosales, thats to late now

 16:38 <jamespage> arosales, I'm going to cancel that entire blueprint

 16:38 <arosales> jamespage, wan to postpone the rest of the work items?

 16:38 <arosales> or still a bit too early for that?

 16:38 <jamespage> its kicked around for two cycles now so can't be that important

 16:38 <jamespage> utlemming, are you likely to find time to work on the webscale WI for nginx?

 16:39 <arosales> utlemming, also got some work items out for you in cloud-init in https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-cloud-init

 16:39 <utlemming> jamepage: not for webscale

 16:39 <jamespage> utlemming, guessed so

 16:39 <jamespage> arosales, I've deferred that entire blueprint

 16:39 <arosales> jamespage, perhaps we can find some more cycles outside of server to do some more "web scale" packaging. I know it would be a plus to get more packages charms use into the archive

 16:39 <utlemming> jamepages: for the ci work, I have done some stuff

 16:40 <utlemming> jamespage: I just need to update that

 16:40 <arosales> utlemming, when you have an opp could you also update the cloud init BP?

 16:40 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-qa

 16:40 <utlemming> arosales: sure thing

 16:40 <arosales> utlemming, thanks

 16:40 <arosales> zul, looks to be in progress

 16:40 <arosales> got a few TODOs there though still

 16:41 <arosales> Daviey, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-interlock

 16:41 <arosales> jamespage, mongo looking ok

 16:41 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-mongodb

 16:42 <jamespage> arosales, ok-ish

 16:42 <jamespage> the MIR is proving challenging tbh

 16:42 <arosales> ya, you fought a pretty good battle around the licensing though

 16:42 <arosales> thanks for your work there.

 16:42 <jamespage> arosales, that should be sorted by 5th sept

 16:42 <arosales> simplestreams, probably need to wait for smoser on that

 16:42 <jamespage> upstream are also engaging on the MIR stuff as well re security team concerns

 16:43 <arosales> jamespage, good to hear

 16:43 <arosales> ah good to know

 16:43 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-juju-contributor-onramp needs an update by jcastro

 16:43 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-juju-charm-testing needs an update by marco when he returns

 16:43 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms

 16:44 <jamespage> we should DONE quite a few this week on the openstack-charms work

 16:44 <jamespage> redux is going nicely

 16:44 <jamespage> then we can get on with feature work

 16:44 <arosales> ah, nice

 16:44 <arosales> hallyn_, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-virtstack

 16:45 <arosales> looks to be progressing . . .

 16:45 <hallyn_> some thigns will surely be postponed yet

 16:45 <arosales> ok

 16:48 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:48 <smb> In order to prepare for uploading Xen 4.3 I started to upload packages

 16:48 <smb> that rdepend on xen stuff to my ppa. Most of them looked ok. I still

 16:48 <smb> would have to check nova. Is anybody doing actually using xen from

 16:48 <smb> openstack who could easily test things?

 16:48 <smb> The bigger problem seems to be xen-api / xen-api-libs which add a

 16:48 <smb> dependency to blktap-dev which include libblktapctl.

 16:48 <smb> Unfortunately Xen also has a lib of the same name (maybe the same

 16:48 <smb> but older source?) which I had to package (or at least thought) into

 16:48 <smb> libxen because otherwise libvirt would not be able to build the libxl

 16:48 <smb> driver. Not sure which way to go there right now. Anybody knows whom

 16:48 <smb> of the Citrix guys would be to contact. Still Mike?

 16:49 <arosales> hallyn_, any opinions ^

 16:49 <jamespage> smb, mike is still good for contact point I think

 16:49 <hallyn_> arosales: no, i always defer on xen to zul and smb

 16:50 <arosales> zul any time to test xen on nova?

 16:50 <arosales> or just contacts for smb?

 16:50 <arosales> Daviey, ^

 16:50 <smb> zul, Or is that maybe also the xen-api guys?

 16:51 <hallyn_> on friday i should be able to test xen on nova, fwiw, but i don't know about the citrix guys

 16:51 <hallyn_> (and i'll have to wipe my lxc on nova setup to do it :)

 16:52 <arosales> hallyn_, thanks, could you coordinate with smb and zul

 16:52 <smb> hallyn_, Ok, maybe I have a solution for the xen-api problem by then. Maybe ping me before you go

 16:52 <arosales> #action hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:52 * meetingology hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:52 <hallyn_> smb: yup

 16:52 <arosales> hallyn_, thanks

 16:52 <arosales> smb, any other topics?

 16:52 <zul> arosales:   not til the end of the month

 16:53 <arosales> zul, ack. Please pass on any contacts that may be helpful to smb or hallyn_

 16:53 * zul is still stuck in the middle of nowhere

 16:53 <zul> arosales: ack

 16:53 <arosales> smb, I'll proceed since time is running short please feel free to interject if you had other topics.
