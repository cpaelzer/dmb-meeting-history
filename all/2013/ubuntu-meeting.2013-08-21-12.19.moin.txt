 12:19 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for August 21, 2013.

 12:20 <jared> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:20 <jared> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:20 <jared> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:20 <jared> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:20 <jared> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:20 <jared> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively).

 12:21 <jared> #voters cyphermox freeflying Destine jared

 12:21 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine cyphermox freeflying jared

 12:21 <jared> Now, without any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:21 <jared> #subtopic mzanetti

 12:21 <mzanetti> hi

 12:21 <jared> #topic mzanetti

 12:22 <jared> mzanetti: thanks for coming along, can you please introduce yourself to the board

 12:22 <mzanetti> Well, I'm Michael.

 12:22 <mzanetti> My current relation to Ubuntu is that I work for canonical and in my spare time try to contribute some other stuff to Ubuntu Touch

 12:23 <mzanetti> In my history (and still a bit) I'm contributing to KDE

 12:23 <mzanetti> the main reason why I apply for membership is to be able to blog on planet.ubuntu

 12:23 <mzanetti> ofc the other stuff you "get" is fun too :)

 12:24 <mzanetti> here's my wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mzanetti

 12:24 <jared> mzanetti: your application wiki page is a little sparse, is there anyone here to support your involvement? We usually like to see some community endorsements to show involvement

 12:25 <mzanetti> hmmm. Jono said he would do if needed, but he's not around. I can ping him

 12:25 <mzanetti> seems it's too early for him

 12:25 <freeflying> mzanetti, :)

 12:26 <mzanetti> well, thb I hoped my blog with latest entries about ubuntu touch would be convincing enough :)

 12:27 <mzanetti> here it is http://notyetthere.org/

 12:27 <jared> On the notthereyet?

 12:27 <mzanetti> yeah

 12:27 <cyphermox> mzanetti: could you say more about what you work on, like, which projects that are of importance to Ubuntu?

 12:28 <jared> mzanetti: I'm scanning it now

 12:28 <mzanetti> yeah: I'm working on a bunch of apps. For example I'm in the process of porting my MeeGo apps to ubuntu touch. That is Xbmcremote and GetMeWheels for now. others to follow

 12:28 <mzanetti> lately I also started to port Marble to Ubuntu Touch. Current state is that it compiles for Qt5

 12:29 <mzanetti> and of course unity8, which is my job tho

 12:29 <mzanetti> here is my launchpad page: https://launchpad.net/~mzanetti

 12:30 <freeflying> mzanetti, marble without kde stuff?

 12:30 <mzanetti> yep

 12:31 <cyphermox> mzanetti: are you involved in your LoCo team?

 12:31 <mzanetti> freeflying: I imagine it to be similar to the Nokia N9 edition in the end

 12:31 <mzanetti> cyphermox: no, I'm not

 12:31 <freeflying> mzanetti, sounds likely

 12:33 <cyphermox> outside your work-related contributions, who do you normally interact with? is there someone else who would cheer for you?

 12:34 <mzanetti> well, depends, I mostly interact at the ubuntu-phone mailing list for that

 12:34 <mzanetti> or irc, but mostly work-mates I'd say

 12:36 <cyphermox> ubuntu-phone is good

 12:37 <mzanetti> and one important communication channel, which is blogging, is the main reason I apply for. to be able to make people aware about the stuff I do.

 12:37 <mzanetti> for example the howto on syncing ubuntu touch with syncevolution

 12:38 <mzanetti> or have visibility on the launchpad ppa's with my apps so people can easily test/use them

 12:38 <mzanetti> it's here btw: https://launchpad.net/~mzanetti/+archive/testing

 12:38 <cyphermox> re: syncevolution, indeed that's quite helpful. playing with evo manually is painful on touch

 12:38 <mzanetti> ah right. I forgot. Also wrote an app for Ubuntu touch for fitbit users

 12:39 <cyphermox> dholbach: ping?

 12:41 <jared> mzanetti: sorry we're doing a lot of reading

 12:41 <mzanetti> no problem

 12:42 <jared> mzanetti: if you can rouse any supporters from other channesl (preferably members) it would be useful

 12:43 <smartboyhw> mzanetti, I would suggest for #ubuntu-touch

 12:46 <mzanetti> I think I found one :)

 12:46 <mzanetti> om26er: ^

 12:47 <jared> om26er: are you about to vouch for mzanetti 's significant and sustained contribnutions via Ubuntu Touch?

 12:47 <om26er> Hey guys, I am here to support mzanetti for his Ubuntu Membership

 12:48 <om26er> jared, yes actually, He have been doing great work for Ubuntu Touch much outside of his job work from what I have seen over the past few months

 12:48 <jared> om26er: great, and it's been sustained (we usually like to see about one release cycle)

 12:49 <om26er> jared, that's atleast since january from what I remember

 12:49 <jared> om26er: awesome to hear

 12:49 <jared> Well we should really get to a vote, sorry to all for it dragging out

 12:49 <jared> #vote mzanetti  to obtain Ubuntu Membership (remembering only Board Members can vote)

 12:49 <meetingology> Please vote on: mzanetti  to obtain Ubuntu Membership (remembering only Board Members can vote)

 12:49 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (private votes don't work yet, but when they do it will be by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0 to me)

 12:50 <mzanetti> also, tsdgeos is not a ubuntu member, but he knows me and my contributions for a while

 12:50 <mzanetti> right tsdgeos?

 12:50 <tsdgeos> exactly

 12:50 <jared> tsdgeos: you're able to support mzanetti's efforts in Ubuntu Touch?

 12:50 <tsdgeos> i can

 12:50 <tsdgeos> +1

 12:50 <tsdgeos> f that helps at all

 12:50 <jared> tsdgeos: thanks for that, we just like to confirm applicants are involved int he community as well

 12:55 <jared> mzanetti: you'll be added to the LP group soonish, then you can make the request to the planet team I believe.

 12:55 <jared> #topic Ck

 12:55 <mzanetti> jared: cheers

 12:55 <kokoye2007> welcom mzanetti

 12:55 <jared> Thanks for waiting Ck, can you please introduce yourself while we read the application

 12:55 <kokoye2007> welcome mzanetti

 12:56 <Ck> Hi every one

 12:56 <Ck> this is Chit Ko Ko Win from Myanmar and this is my 2nd try

 12:57 <Ck> I help translation wiki into burmese language and

 12:57 <Ck> burmese localization team .

 12:58 <jared> Thanks for putting the extra information in the application, we're just reading over it now

 12:58 <Ck> I translate some articles in http://chitkoko.ubuntu-mm.net/

 12:59 <Ck> and we translate ubuntuguide.org 80% done in offline and

 12:59 <Ck> next month will be publish.

 13:00 <freeflying> Ck, do you have any plan on ubuntu dev document?

 13:00 <jared> Ck: I also notice there isn't a lot of translation on launchpad, is that for a reason?

 13:00 <Ck> Yes, I try to translate Ubuntu -manual guide into burmese language offline

 13:02 <Ck> Yes, we 're poor connection

 13:02 <Ck> but edit at PO

 13:02 <Ck> Right now , I teach ubuntu training 4day -aweek and 3 months.

 13:03 <jared> Ck: ah, that's ok. I was curious as you all seem to do lots of translation but not much on launchpad. I understand now

 13:03 <Ck> already past 4 weeeks. .

 13:03 <Ck> yesa

 13:04 <Ck> I know

 13:04 <jared> #voters cyphermox freeflying Destine jared hggdh

 13:04 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine cyphermox freeflying hggdh jared

 13:04 <Ck> right now ,I gave a time for people in our class

 13:04 <Ck> sorry for launchpad.

 13:05 <hggdh> Ck no problem

 13:05 <Ck> In our country ,connection back bone wasw cut in past weeks.

 13:05 <jared> jounih: are you the same Jouni on Ck (Chit's) wiki page? It's not signed with a LP or Wiki login so just confirming

 13:06 <kokoye2007> Ck: is Our Local Community Top Contributor

 13:06 <jounih> jared - hi, yep that's me

 13:06 <Ck> Yes. this is me.

 13:06 <jared> jounih: great to see, they look like they're doing great work in Myanmar, last time Chit applied it was hard to tell which members were doing what.

 13:07 <jounih> jared, yep, they are doing brilliant work over there, I met them in March when we were doing a couple of talks together on Ubuntu and Ubuntu Touch

 13:07 <jared> jounih: awesome

 13:07 <jounih> Chit Ko, Ko Ko Ye and a few others travel around the country lecturing about Ubuntu - completely on their own expense and with the help of some local sponsors

 13:08 <jounih> they've managed to push ubuntu to be the 2nd most used OS in the country, it's pretty impressive

 13:09 <jounih> largely due to the education and the localisation work they do

 13:09 <jared> jounih: awesome

 13:10 <Ck> you can find our work done in http://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntu-mm and we already change

 13:10 <Ck> Myanmar semi -gov .

 13:10 <Ck> into Ubuntu  OS.

 13:10 <jounih> i've got a bunch of video i shot over there, just editing it to a couple of minutes long clip, going to publish that on our blog and send to Mark S to check out. I think there's a big opportunity for Ubuntu Toouch over there too (if we can localise it to Burmese), as they are opening up the telco market and letting foreign telcos in

 13:11 <freeflying> Ck, brilliant

 13:11 <jared> Ck: your application is much better this time aruond, sorry for the hassles last time btu I don't think the language barrier helped.

 13:11 <hggdh> jounih: we do appreciate your help here, thank you

 13:12 * cyphermox thinks perhaps it's time someone implements the private voting in meetingology, just to remove the message :)
