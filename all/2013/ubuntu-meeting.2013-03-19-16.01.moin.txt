 16:02:41 <arosales> we really need to do a better job of updating minutes, actions, and sending out that information; especially me :-)

 16:03:14 <arosales> before I jump in could we get a quick hello from folks for the Ubuntu Server meeting?

 16:03:25 <zul> hi

 16:06:25 <arosales> and one more for james

 16:07:10 <arosales> jamespage: thanks.

 16:07:25 <arosales> jamespage: do you want an action for milestone testing?

 16:16:26 <arosales> hallyn: status in the bug looks to be confirmed, and in progress for the distro tasks.

 16:16:45 <arosales> hallyn: is it appropriate to move to fix available and comment?

 16:17:15 * hallyn doesn't knwo what that means :)

 16:17:21 <hallyn> it's fixed in raring.

 16:17:38 <arosales> hallyn: sorry let me state it differently

 16:18:00 <arosales> hallyn: could you update the bug to reflect its current state of being fixed (ie fix available) with a supporting comment?

 16:19:01 <arosales> hallyn: I am referring to 1092715

 16:19:09 <jamespage> its fixed in the trunk testing PPA

 16:19:12 <hallyn> oh.  right.  arosales: that bug is not fixed, and likely never will be.  can you un-mark it targeting the release ro whatever?

 16:19:13 <arosales> jamespage: thanks

 16:19:35 <hallyn> i'll add a comment clarifying

 16:19:43 <arosales> hallyn: could you add a comment into that bug so folks know why the status is as such

 16:21:43 * arosales reviewing BPs in the "red"

 16:22:08 <smoser> yep. it is in the right color at the moment.

 16:22:18 <arosales> smoser: ok, any tasks that need postponing, or not quite yet?

 16:22:27 <smoser> not quite yet.

 16:22:38 <arosales> smoser: ok

 16:22:40 <arosales> thanks

 16:22:45 <arosales> jamespage: how is https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow

 16:22:55 <jamespage> not well

 16:23:06 <jamespage> its lower priority that other pieces so its not getting focus

 16:23:15 <arosales> jamespage ok, any blockers?

 16:23:22 <jamespage> other than time, no

 16:23:23 <arosales> or just time and queue

 16:25:26 <arosales> ok

 16:25:40 <arosales> rbasak: any time for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-apt-improvements ?

 16:26:03 <arosales> not sure norvald is here by the mysql one may need deferring (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-mysql_

 16:26:09 <rbasak> I haven't had time to work on this recently - sorry. I still think I can get something in before raring release, but since we're past FF I don't expect anything to land

 16:27:04 <arosales> hmm ok, any candidates to postpone?

 16:27:28 <arosales> not sure if caribou is around either, but https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool may need some evaluation

 16:27:45 <arosales> ok, that wraps up BPs

 16:28:00 <Daviey> arosales: servercloud-r-cloudarchive is progressing well.. no concerns

 16:28:06 <arosales> rbasak: may want to see what tasks you can postpone for the apt BPs

 16:28:19 <arosales> Daviey: ok thanks.

 16:30:29 <smb> arosales, -EWRONGPERSON?

 16:30:31 <hallyn> ^ i swear i updated that,   did someone change it back?

 16:30:44 <arosales> hmm https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting/IRCCommands needs updating

 16:30:44 <hallyn> plars: howdie :)

 16:30:46 * arosales will do that now

 16:30:51 <arosales> sorry plars

 16:31:01 <plars> hi

 16:31:04 <arosales> any questions for plars or updates from plars ?

 16:31:30 <plars> not too much from me today... there are a few of the conf file issues if someone wants to take a look

 16:31:31 <plars> http://10.98.0.1:8080/view/Raring/view/Smoke%20Testing/job/raring-upgrade-quantal-server/ARCH=amd64,LTS=non-lts,PROFILE=server-tasks,label=upgrade-test/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/results/obsolete_conffiles.log

 16:31:41 <plars> I did have one question, about ceph testing

 16:31:47 <plars> are there any further plans for that still?

 16:32:08 <arosales> jamespage any ceph testing plans?

 16:32:16 <jamespage> hrm - yes

 16:32:22 <jamespage> but I've got sidetracked

 16:32:44 <jamespage> I have got some stuff running the the CI lab for multi-node ceph testing

 16:32:58 <arosales> plars http://10.98.0.1:8080/view/Raring/view/Smoke%20Testing/job/raring-upgrade-quantal-server/ARCH=amd64,LTS=non-lts,PROFILE=server-tasks,label=upgrade-test/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/results/obsolete_conffiles.log is taking a bit to load for me . . .  not sure if others are seeing this.

 16:33:01 <jamespage> plars, I think the utah test adds limited value as its so unlike an actual ceph deployment

 16:33:02 <arosales> and timed out

 16:33:03 <jamespage> :-)

 16:33:23 <plars> jamespage: if you have it covered there, then all is well, just wanted to know if we needed to do anything with the tests still lingering (but disabled) in our jenkins right now

 16:33:24 <jamespage> plars, can you give the external jenkins URL when referring to results please

 16:33:33 <plars> ah, sorry

 16:33:38 <plars> one sec

 16:33:59 <plars> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/Smoke%20Testing/job/raring-upgrade-quantal-server/ARCH=amd64,LTS=non-lts,PROFILE=server-tasks,label=upgrade-test/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/results/obsolete_conffiles.log

 16:34:12 <arosales> ah better

 16:34:49 <plars> that's all from me then

 16:34:52 <arosales> plars: so colord and cups config it looks like

 16:34:55 <arosales> ok

 16:35:14 <arosales> any other questions for plars?

 16:35:30 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:35:35 <arosales> smb hello :-)

 16:35:40 <smb> Not much to report. Pending review/sponsoring for Xen in Raring. Currently checking on a Xen regression which started in Quantal but requires a certain HW combination to trigger (Intel CPU and I suspect x2apic, though the latter is just guessing).

 16:35:41 <smb> ..

 16:35:58 <arosales> smb: ok thanks for the update

 16:36:02 <arosales> any questions for smb?

 16:36:13 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:36:36 <arosales> rbask: any updates on ARM?

 16:37:09 <arosales> I think rbask was here earlier . . .

 16:37:45 <arosales> any ARM related questions?

 16:37:57 <arosales> #topic Open Discussion

 16:38:27 <arosales> Any other items to discuss?
