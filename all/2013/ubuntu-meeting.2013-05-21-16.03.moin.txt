 16:03 <adam_g> hey all

 16:03 <jamespage> o/

 16:03 <arosales> Hello o/

 16:03 <Daviey> \o

 16:04 <adam_g> hmm. we had no meeting last week because of UDS, correct?  last minutes i can find are @ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20130423

 16:04 <Daviey> Correct

 16:04 <adam_g> coolio

 16:04 <adam_g> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:04 <Daviey> adam_g: I think use the agenda from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting

 16:05 <smoser> o/

 16:06 <adam_g> so, we have no action poitns from last

 16:06 <adam_g> Moving on?

 16:06 <Daviey> adam_g: see the 3 things in Agenda?

 16:06 <Daviey> (carried forward) arosales .. etc?

 16:07 <adam_g> Oh, sorry. I was looking at the 20130423 minutes

 16:07 <adam_g> arosales, any update: arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU?

 16:08 <arosales> ugh, sorry /me still has a todo to follow up with Norvald.

 16:08 <adam_g> k

 16:08 <arosales> I thought there may be some discussion and vUDS, but I don't think norvald was there.

 16:08 <adam_g> #action (carried forward) arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:08 * meetingology (carried forward) arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:09 <adam_g> zul, any updates on the complexity of percona packaging in Ubuntu? i know therew was discussion at UDS

 16:10 <zul> adam_g:  not really percona is giong to be working on thier stuff to get into the archive via debian and we will go from there

 16:10 <adam_g> zul, cool is there a timeframe for that or relevant workitems/blueprint?

 16:11 <Daviey> Yeah, great progress was made with percona at vUDS

 16:11 <zul> adam_g:  no but ill update the work items

 16:11 <Daviey> I feel confident enough we can remove it from the agenda.

 16:11 <adam_g> Daviey, is there an action to remove it or just do not record as a new action for next meeting?

 16:11 <Daviey> adam_g: yeah, just drop it on the floor.  No action needed, it'll be in blueprint, right zul? :)

 16:12 <zul> right

 16:12 <adam_g> k

 16:12 <adam_g> smoser to reach out to juju-core and discuss what integration with ubuntu image meta data can be done for Raring.

 16:12 <adam_g> smoser, any update? assume it didn't make it for raring, but any update on what is in store for saucy with regard to ubuntu images?

 16:13 <smoser> juju-core support for simple streams data is basically in.

 16:13 <adam_g> ah!

 16:13 <doko> smoser, adam_g: do you know if there is any work planned to integrate the no goyaml into juju-core?

 16:13 <TheLordOfTime> o/ (late sorry!)

 16:14 <smoser> i don't know.

 16:14 <adam_g> smoser, is there anything left to be done at that front that needs to be carried over?

 16:14 <smoser> no

 16:15 <adam_g> doko, i'd be surprised if they were not already using goyaml but you'd have to check with #juju-dev

 16:15 <adam_g> Moving on?

 16:15 <Daviey> adam_g: Looks good!

 16:15 <adam_g> #TOPIC Saucy Development

 16:16 <jamespage> hello saucy salamander!

 16:16 <Daviey> Still early in the cycle... and with vUDS last week.. we are getting things sorted.

 16:16 <adam_g> well, we're probably all working on merges and syncs for some time now

 16:16 <Daviey> jamespage: How are blueprints looking?

 16:16 * hallyn hides his behind his back

 16:17 <jamespage> hands up who still has blueprints to write up from last week?

 16:17 * jamespage puts his hand up

 16:17 <hallyn> o/

 16:17 <Daviey> We need to make good use of the Blueprint review staus

 16:17 * zul does

 16:17 <hallyn> i'll get to it this week

 16:17 <adam_g> jamespage, is there a URL to get a list of blueprints filtered by the server team for S? was having trouble with this yesterday

 16:17 <hallyn> Daviey: what does that mean?

 16:17 <jamespage> OK _ so please can drafters sync up with session notes and document work items as well

 16:17 <hallyn> yup

 16:18 <Daviey> hallyn: see the Design field?

 16:18 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+specs?role=assignee

 16:18 <Daviey> Lets pick on, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-mongodb

 16:18 <Daviey> See it's Defintion is marked as Review?

 16:18 <hallyn> y

 16:19 <adam_g> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+specs?role=assignee

 16:19 <hallyn> Daviey: so switch that to drafting while working, then discussion when doen?

 16:19 <Daviey> hallyn: When the blueprint is at a state where it can be moved forward, mark it as review.. So Scott, James and Myself can take a gander.

 16:20 <Daviey> hallyn: Discussion is supposed to be last week.. Drafting is the current status

 16:20 <Daviey> Review for, "Please Ack it"

 16:20 <hallyn> ok

 16:20 <Daviey> "Approved" is commence work

 16:21 <jamespage> please can folks try to get stuff into a 'Review' state by the end this week

 16:21 <jamespage> Daviey, does that sound reasonable

 16:21 <hallyn> yes, sir

 16:21 <rbasak> Is that why work items don't yet appear on my own page on status.ubuntu.com?

 16:21 <Daviey> jamespage: That sounds a super plan

 16:21 <hallyn> tsk tsk

 16:21 <Daviey> rbasak: Sounds about right.

 16:21 <jamespage> if people want some help then please ping me, smoser or Daviey

 16:22 <arosales> Daviey, do we also need a topic for servercloud on status.u.c or should work items for individuals show up?

 16:22 <jamespage> where help == guidance != write the spec for you :-)

 16:22 <Daviey> arosales: I think we do indeed need a topic

 16:22 <Daviey> arosales: I actually thought there were topics, but it looks like they are unrelated

 16:23 <arosales> #action arosales to create status.u.c topics

 16:23 * meetingology arosales to create status.u.c topics

 16:23 <Daviey> arosales: You sir, are a true gent.

 16:23 <adam_g> cool

 16:23 <arosales> I'll do an "ecosystem" and "overview" topic any others folks are interested in?

 16:23 <adam_g> anything else?

 16:24 <jamespage> thanks arosales

 16:24 <jamespage> oh - I had one more thing

 16:24 <adam_g> sure

 16:24 <arosales> glad to help where I can

 16:24 <jamespage> last cycle each blueprint had a individual assignee and ubuntu-server as the drafter

 16:25 <jamespage> this mean that work-items where by default owned by an individual rather than the team

 16:25 <jamespage> Daviey, we seem to have switch that this cycle

 16:25 <jamespage> so work-items are team owned unless specifically assigned

 16:25 <Daviey> jamespage: You are certain that s.u.c won't DTRT?

 16:25 * jamespage shrugs

 16:26 <Daviey> Maybe i am going barmy, but i'd imagine Assignee to be the main person on the hook for the blueprint?

 16:26 <Daviey> ie, default owner of WI

 16:26 <jamespage> Daviey, yes - but right now that's ubuntu-server team

 16:26 <Daviey> BUT, if we do it the other way (AKA last cycle).. we get a pool of unowned work, which is ~ubuntu-server

 16:26 <Daviey> So maybe that makes more sense?

 16:27 <jamespage> no - we have a pool of unowned work with the way we have it now

 16:27 <Daviey> jamespage: Ah yes.

 16:27 <jamespage> I think that is wrong

 16:27 <Daviey> jamespage: default to unowned sounds subpar to me.. What do you think?

 16:28 <arosales> could Drafter and Assignee be switched?

 16:28 <jamespage> sounds like we agree; can people switch them around please for the blueprints they are currently assigned as drafter for

 16:28 <Daviey> jamespage: Ok, lets switch it around.  I'll do that for ones i am Approver of

 16:28 <jamespage> ta

 16:28 <Daviey> jamespage: I'll just bulk it.

 16:28 <jamespage> adam_g, OK - I think we are done on that one

 16:28 <jamespage> Daviey, ta

 16:28 <adam_g> ok

 16:29 <adam_g> i assume its too early to review release bugs, eh?

 16:29 <Daviey> #ACTION Daviey to switcheroo Assignee & Drafter for Saucy blueprints.

 16:29 * meetingology Daviey to switcheroo Assignee & Drafter for Saucy blueprints.

 16:29 <Daviey> arosales: yeah, i don't think we have any bugs to worry too much about.

 16:29 <Daviey> err, adam_g ^

 16:30 <jamespage> adam_g, can you action me to chase down bdmurray about the release tracking report

 16:30 <Daviey> zul seems to have identified a bunch of FTBFS and jenkins build failures with Havana on Saucy.. but not pertinent here i don't think

 16:30 <adam_g> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:30 <jamespage> I sware its not working again

 16:30 <Daviey> jamespage: release tracking report?

 16:30 <jamespage> release bug tracking report

 16:30 <Daviey> jamespage: url?

 16:31 <jamespage> actually don't bother - its working now - http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-s-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:31 <Daviey> rls-s-tracking-bugs.html

 16:31 <Daviey> right

 16:31 <adam_g> is anyone attending any events worth noting here?

 16:32 <arosales> for events m_3 is at http://www.gluecon.com/2013/ this week

 16:32 <jamespage> there is an openstack and mysql meetup in london on thursday

 16:32 <arosales> I am at http://2013.texaslinuxfest.org/ at the end of the month

 16:32 <jamespage> I'm not attending but Daviey is I think

 16:32 <Daviey> I am at Openstack London meetup this Thursday

 16:32 <Daviey> I am at Mysql London meetup this Thursday

 16:34 <adam_g> plars, hi

 16:35 <adam_g> if plars is not making it, anything else QA related?

 16:35 <plars> hi, I'm here

 16:35 <adam_g> oh! hi :)

 16:35 <Daviey> \o/

 16:35 <plars> not much, hallyn I think was looking at a bug on lxc?

 16:35 <plars> one moment, let me dig up the bug #

 16:35 <plars> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1182540

 16:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1182540 in lxc (Ubuntu) "lxc smoke test, test_lxc_apparmor appears to hang on saucy VM" [Undecided,New]

 16:36 <plars> I believe you've already talked to psivaa about that though right?

 16:36 <hallyn> uh, is that the one hementioned this morning?

 16:36 <plars> also, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1181315 is affecting the floodlight test, kernel team is aware and looking into it

 16:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1181315 in linux (Ubuntu) "unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2' is reported and causing kernel hang when floodlight tests are run using utah" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:36 <plars> hallyn: yep

 16:36 <adam_g> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1181315

 16:36 <hallyn> i ahdn't seen the open bug

 16:37 <adam_g> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1182540

 16:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1182540 in lxc (Ubuntu) "lxc smoke test, test_lxc_apparmor appears to hang on saucy VM" [Undecided,New]

 16:37 <hallyn> couldn't reproduce with a fresh saucy install

 16:37 <Daviey> yolanda: did you send that mail to ubuntu-qa, about dep-8?

 16:37 <hallyn> plars: have him ping me if it happens again on next run pls

 16:37 <yolanda> Daviey, yes, i also had you and Jamie in CC

 16:37 <hallyn> it appeared to be hung on flock

 16:37 <plars> hallyn: yes, he's running again to get additional information

 16:37 <plars> nothing else from me

 16:37 <yolanda> i received a message from ubuntu-qa, telling that is pending of moderation

 16:37 <hallyn> plars: thanks

 16:38 <Daviey> yolanda: super

 16:38 <adam_g> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:38 <adam_g> smb, hello sir

 16:38 <Daviey> smb is away

 16:38 <adam_g> ah

 16:39 <Daviey> I think we can skip this section this week.

 16:39 <adam_g> ...and i actually had a question!

 16:39 <Daviey> Oh

 16:39 <Daviey> apw: Can you help answer a kernel question? :)

 16:39 <adam_g> i was just wondering if we knew exactly what kernel requirements are needed to do xen now.

 16:39 <apw> Daviey, ?

 16:40 <Daviey> apw: adam_g said he had a kernel question.

 16:40 <adam_g> was hoping someone could confirm whether a reboot is necessary. we touched on this at UDS but seemed nobody knew for sure

 16:40 <apw> adam_g, needed to do xen ?

 16:40 <apw> a reboot following what?

 16:40 <adam_g> apw, can the vanilla kernel shipped /w ubuntu currently support running a xen hypervisor?

 16:40 <Daviey> As far as i a aware, the primary kernel we ship is xen dom0 enabled OOTB

 16:41 <apw> the vanilla kernel can be a dom0 kernel yes, obviously you still need to reboot following selecting xen as your hypervisor so it can get underneath the kernel

 16:42 <adam_g> apw, thats what i wanted to know, thanks. someone mentioned that was no longer necessary last week.

 16:42 <adam_g> thanks

 16:42 <Daviey> apw: so that fiddles grub config?

 16:42 <adam_g> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:42 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:43 <adam_g> Nothing for rbasak?

 16:44 <Daviey> None

 16:44 <adam_g> #topic Open Discussion

 16:44 <arosales> good blog post by roaksoax for maas juju set up @  http://www.roaksoax.com/2013/05/getting-started-with-maas-and-juju

 16:44 <Daviey> +1

 16:44 <rbasak> I'd like to draw attention to https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-discuss/2013-May/014518.html - for those interested in ldap, sssd, etc.

 16:44 <Daviey> TheLordOfTime: Hello

 16:44 <TheLordOfTime> Daviey:  hiya!

 16:45 <TheLordOfTime> if you don't mind me stealing the floor for a few moments... :P

 16:45 <rbasak> I'm also still soliciting comments on errors.ubuntu.com on the ubuntu-server list.

 16:45 <Daviey> I need to dive out now, but TheLordOfTime wanted to discuss nginx

 16:45 <marcoceppi> yay nginx

 16:45 <TheLordOfTime> Per https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+bug/1177919/comments/3 there was an informal request to consider nginx for inclusion either on the images or as part of tasksel

 16:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1177919 in nginx (Ubuntu) "Merge nginx 1.4.1-1 (universe) from Debian unstable (main)" [Wishlist,Fix released]

 16:45 <TheLordOfTime> or some other system.

 16:45 <TheLordOfTime> the bug itself is irrelevant, but the comment is what i'm drawing attention to

 16:46 <TheLordOfTime> nginx has gotten a lot more widespread use, and it's bugfixing has been a bit faster, namely because i've unofficially adopted it on the ubuntu side

 16:46 <TheLordOfTime> i've seen other requests about whether nginx would be included on the images ever, and I've had to answer "I don't know"

 16:47 <jamespage> hmm - we did look at this during raring

 16:47 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-webscale

 16:47 <rbasak> To be clear, are you suggesting nginx together with apache2 in main, or nginx to replace apache2 in main?

 16:47 <jamespage> utlemming, around? ^^ any comment on nginx into main

 16:47 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak:  i don't remember where the discussion of making nginx part of main went.

 16:47 <utlemming> jamespage: yeah...the problem here is that security doesn't seemed to thrilled about it

 16:47 <TheLordOfTime> it was a uds talkpoint

 16:47 <jamespage> ah - and here again - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-webscale

 16:48 <jamespage> and I'm the drafter

 16:48 <adam_g> i'm surprised nginx hasn't been promoted to main by now.

 16:48 * jamespage faceplants

 16:48 <utlemming> jamespage: the issue is nginx has a long history of CVE's and long standing security issues

 16:48 <jamespage> utlemming, that certainly used to be the case - but is that true now?

 16:48 <rbasak> I agree that nginx is popular, mature and has widespread use now. Not sure about the security side of things.

 16:48 <TheLordOfTime> there are active CVEs.

 16:48 <TheLordOfTime> well, last i checked, at least one

 16:48 * TheLordOfTime pulls the bug

 16:48 <rbasak> It would be nice to have a "lightweight/minimal httpd" in main.

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> this is the last bug I saw: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+bug/1098654

 16:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1098654 in nginx (Ubuntu Raring) "nginx vulnerable to MITM Attack [CVE-2011-4968]" [Low,Confirmed]

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> granted i pulled that from debian and upstream trackers

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> it seems upstream's ignoring it though

 16:49 <rbasak> (in addition to the do-everything heavyweight httpd that is apache)

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak:  i'm bringing it up as a talking point, not from my opinions

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> as we're aware, a common HTTPd deployment is LAMP

 16:49 <TheLordOfTime> Apache, MySQL, and PHP

 16:50 <TheLordOfTime> nginx has zero OOTB configurations that include PHP

 16:50 <rbasak> Just reading that bug now. That seems like a really obscure case.

 16:50 <TheLordOfTime> as it depends on php5-fpm (or similar) and proxy_pass-ing to the php5 backend

 16:50 <rbasak> Who runs nginx in reverse proxy mode to an https server over an insecure network?

 16:50 <TheLordOfTime> whether that's an fcgi wrapper or a php5-fpm running

 16:50 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak:  nobody, but that's an example of a known CVE that has gotten zero upstream attention

 16:51 <TheLordOfTime> unless I missed a few commits...

 16:51 <rbasak> TheLordOfTime: yeah sure. That wasn't aimed at you - I appreciate you bringing it up.

 16:51 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak:  no problem :)

 16:51 <TheLordOfTime> but lemme go back to my initial "not a good inclusion" argument

 16:52 <TheLordOfTime> we're aware LAMP is an easy-to-deploy system because Apache has a loadable module that speaks to php5

 16:52 <rbasak> What I'm saying is that I'm not sure that should block an MIR - but I'm not as familiar with MIR policy and history as I'd like, or understand what security policy with that kind of vulnerability would be.

 16:52 <TheLordOfTime> nginx doesn't have that, it requires manual configuration to work

 16:52 <TheLordOfTime> although the sample default config *does* have a compatible clause that would allow php to work

 16:52 <TheLordOfTime> but it's commented out by default

 16:53 <rbasak> IMHO, nginx isn't necessarily supposed to have that. Even though I have put PHP behind nginx before.

 16:53 <TheLordOfTime> i'm not sure what other points need to be addressed, maybe talk to the security team about their concerns.

 16:53 <rbasak> I put some kind of fastcgi thing in the middle, IIRC.

 16:53 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak:  it isn't, but debian included a default config with samples that work with Ubuntu/Debian php5-fpm out of the box

 16:54 <TheLordOfTime> nginx debian package that is

 16:54 <rbasak> OK...so where are we with it?

 16:54 <TheLordOfTime> that's the discussion here.

 16:54 <TheLordOfTime> personally, I vote to NOT move it to main

 16:55 <TheLordOfTime> because the only person actively watching it in Ubuntu is me and maybe a few others

 16:55 <TheLordOfTime> (probably mostly me, though...)

 16:55 <TheLordOfTime> i also don't want to deal with an extra influx of "how do i configure it for [usecase]" questions

 16:55 <TheLordOfTime> as those're bound to flood into existence if we include it on the images.

 16:56 <TheLordOfTime> but my point here was to bring the discussion up again

 16:56 <TheLordOfTime> i'm curious whether anyone else here has an opinion on moving it to main and/or including on the images.

 16:56 <TheLordOfTime> and whether there's concerns from others on it.

 16:56 <rbasak> I'm not sure those last two reasons are valid - but we're running out of time.

 16:57 <TheLordOfTime> if there's anything I can answer, questions or the such, i'll answer if i can

 16:57 <adam_g> can we take this to #ubuntu-server?

 16:57 <adam_g> 2 minutes left here

 16:57 <TheLordOfTime> we can, or we can take it to the mailing list,

 16:57 * TheLordOfTime is on both places

 16:57 <jamespage> +1 ML

 16:57 <rbasak> My concern would mainly be around whether it's suitable under main inclusion policy, who would look after it, and how much work it'd be.

 16:58 <adam_g> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:58 <adam_g> May 28th 16:00 UTC

 16:58 <TheLordOfTime> last point on that last topic of nginx: we may want to discuss on the ML about this, so others who weren't here can chime in.

 16:59 <TheLordOfTime> i'd say that's the first place to bring it up

 16:59 * TheLordOfTime is done.

 16:59 <arosales> adam_g, thanks for chairing

 16:59 <adam_g> TheLordOfTime, i agree. there are plenty of admins out there who are heavily vested that are not on IRC

 16:59 <rbasak> TheLordOfTime: will do - thanks for bringing it up

 16:59 <adam_g> till next week

 16:59 <adam_g> #endmeeting
