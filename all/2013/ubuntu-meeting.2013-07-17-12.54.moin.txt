 12:54 <hggdh> all: we are sorry for this delay

 12:55 <hggdh> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for July 4th, 2013.

 12:55 <hggdh> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:55 <hggdh> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:55 <hggdh> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:55 <hggdh> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:55 <hggdh> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:55 <hggdh> (sorry, I am just logging in, waiting for my browser to start)

 12:55 <cjohnston> s/July 4, 2013/July 17. 2013 just for the log :-)

 12:58 <eliasps> Hello everyone

 12:58 <eliasps> My name is Elias, I live in Greece and I'm currently a math student. I am an Ubuntu user since 2007 and member of the Ubuntu-gr community since 2011.

 12:58 <iulian> Hi there.

 12:58 <eliasps> Here is my wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/eliasps and my account in launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~eliasps

 12:59 <eliasps> I activelly provide user support and giving advice in Ubuntu-gr forums and IRC on a daily basis, since my registration.

 12:59 <eliasps> Later on, I started translating Ubuntu and became member of the Ubuntu Greek Translators team. 2 months ago I responded to the need for new moderators in Ubuntu-gr forum and thanks to its members, I am now a global moderator of Ubuntu-gr forum and G+ Community.

 12:59 <eliasps> I am also the main desinger of Ubuntistas e-magazine, the magazine of the Greek Ubuntu community, which I bring into its final form by using LaTeX. Ubuntistas is available for free of course, at Ubuntu Software Center. ubuntistas.ubuntu-gr.org

 13:00 <eliasps> I try to participate in testing Ubuntu for bugs. I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 and currently trying out Mir display server.

 13:00 <eliasps> I keep myself updated for any tests that needs to be done.

 13:00 <eliasps> My main goal is to continue providing support to everyone in need inside and outside of the forums, keep promoting FOSS and especially Ubuntu in Greece and encourage new members to get involved as well.

 13:00 <eliasps> Today, I am in a daily contact with other activelly contributing members of our community and we are constantly trying to improve and expand our community's projects. I see some of them present here and I thank them for their support! :)

 13:01 <eliasps> Here are some photos of us at Ubuntu 13.04 release party in Athens: http://www.ubuntu-gr.org/content/ubuntu-release-party-raring-ringtail-athens-2013

 13:01 <eliasps> And from Ubuntu hour a few days ago: http://www.ubuntu-gr.org/story/17-07-13/ubuntu-hour-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%AE%CE%BD%CE%B1-12-%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-2013

 13:01 <eliasps> That's pretty much my story with Ubuntu. I must thank all those people that inspired me to get involved and helped me with my first steps.

 13:02 <hggdh> eliasps: on the Athens photo -- who are you there?
