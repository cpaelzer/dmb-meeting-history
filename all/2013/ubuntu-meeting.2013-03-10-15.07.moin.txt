 15:07:29 <JontheEchidna> oops

 15:07:34 <JontheEchidna> Darkwing: thanks

 15:07:35 <smartboyhw> Got it now:)

 15:07:47 <xnox> smartboyhw: have you been involved in UbuntuKylin? The new chinese ubuntu flavour?

 15:07:52 <Darkwing> #meetingtopic membership of smartboyhw

 15:08:09 <smartboyhw> xnox, sort of:)

 15:08:14 <Darkwing> #meetingtopic kubuntu membership of smartboyhw

 15:09:07 <jussi> smartboyhw: give us an introduction to who you are, and your activity in Ubuntu/Kubuntu

 15:09:16 <smartboyhw> jussi, OK

 15:09:26 <jussi> Darkwing: #topic

 15:09:30 <smartboyhw> I'm Howard Chan, 14-year-old active contributor to Ubuntu/Kubuntu

 15:09:41 <Darkwing> #topic kubuntu membership of smartboyhw

 15:09:43 <smartboyhw> I joined Kubuntu to start work on some development

 15:09:51 <Darkwing> #meetingtopic kubuntu meeting

 15:09:56 <smartboyhw> And so I am now starting to help packaging:)

 15:10:13 <smartboyhw> Some applications I have packaged include

 15:10:57 <smartboyhw> Calligra, Rekonq, libktorrent (+ request KTorrent sync) Homerun, kde-gtk-config and request for skrooge sync

 15:11:09 <smartboyhw> I've also helped testing for Kubuntu in Alpha 1 + 12.04.2

 15:11:29 <smartboyhw> And as for the general Ubuntu contributions....

 15:11:39 <smartboyhw> I'm an active member of the Ubuntu Community QA Team

 15:11:44 <valorie> they are impressive!

 15:11:50 <smartboyhw> I help to write testcases, and test ISO images

 15:12:04 * smartboyhw ranked third in testing 12.04.2 images BTW (really weird)

 15:12:19 <smartboyhw> And also I am an contributor to Ubuntu Studio

 15:12:30 <smartboyhw> QA also, and release matters

 15:12:33 <smartboyhw> ..

 15:13:03 * smartboyhw is a Kubuntu Ninja BTQ

 15:13:09 <smartboyhw> s/BTQ/BTW/ :P

 15:13:10 <valorie> you are already an Ubuntu Member; why are you now applying for Kubuntu membership as well?

 15:13:21 <Darkwing> dang it valorie that was my question :P:P

 15:13:22 <smartboyhw> valorie, this is the most important question

 15:13:31 <valorie> hehe

 15:13:54 <smartboyhw> apachelogger once said that joining in ~kubuntu-packagers and have commit access to these branches should either be ~ubuntu-core-dev or ~kubuntu-members

 15:14:07 <jussi> smartboyhw: how long have you been contributing to Kubuntu?

 15:14:39 <smartboyhw> I do feel that I have the trust from community + enough learning of packaging to have commit access

 15:14:49 <smartboyhw> jussi, 1 month or so (maybe more)

 15:14:50 <smartboyhw> IDK

 15:14:53 * smartboyhw has forgotten

 15:15:12 <valorie> do you intend to get involved with the upstream KDE community?

 15:15:26 <smartboyhw> valorie, yes. Possibly with Calligra or Rekonq

 15:15:56 <smartboyhw> I don't want to just help them with packaging

 15:16:04 <smartboyhw> But also actual bug-fixing

 15:16:14 <JontheEchidna> That's great

 15:16:16 <smartboyhw> (upstream)

 15:16:23 <valorie> a month or so seems very short to me, however you have a good record with Ubuntu already

 15:16:31 <smartboyhw> Riddell already gave me a +1

 15:16:34 <smartboyhw> :P

 15:16:35 <Darkwing> Where do you see yourself within Kubuntu in a year?

 15:16:48 <valorie> both those teams could use your enthusiasm for sure

 15:16:49 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, if I can I would want to be ~kubuntu-dev

 15:17:12 <valorie> are you planning to attend Akademy?

 15:17:25 <valorie> registration has just opened

 15:17:34 <smartboyhw> valorie, no (I've got school don't forget, and when it's Akademy time I'll be London for study tour)

 15:17:38 <smartboyhw> Really sorry

 15:17:55 <smartboyhw> Possibly I will want to meet Riddell or phillw in person:P (LOL)

 15:18:02 <valorie> bummer

 15:18:03 <Darkwing> smartboyhw: do you run Kubuntu at the moment?

 15:18:14 <valorie> cool on the trip, bummer on missing us

 15:18:31 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, no actually (since strangely my login screen breaks my graphics)

 15:18:37 <smartboyhw> And I still got Ubuntu Studio to support:P

 15:18:45 <smartboyhw> I want to get that fixed too

 15:18:59 <smartboyhw> (but that will require some in-depth look into kernel modules + AMD drivers)

 15:19:20 <Darkwing> smartboyhw: Yeah, it does on mine as well, that's why I'm running the LTS.

 15:19:29 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, I don't run LTSes

 15:19:41 <smartboyhw> I need to be in the development release at all times

 15:19:53 <smartboyhw> for QA + packaging trial-installs-plus-runs

 15:20:17 <Darkwing> So, beyond kubuntu-dev, what is the reason you are looking for kubuntu-membership?

 15:20:34 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, I am really hoping to contribute to Kubuntu long-time

 15:20:51 <Darkwing> Do you feel that you need to be a kubuntu member for that?

 15:20:58 <smartboyhw> As you can see from my Planet Ubuntu posts, I am starting to get disappointed in Canonical's policies

 15:21:34 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, not exactly. However I want to wear my ~kubuntu-members *badge or whatever* with pride

 15:21:46 <smartboyhw> That I am indeed contributing to KDE and Kubuntu

 15:21:51 <valorie> you might want to add your blog to the KDE planet as well

 15:21:52 <smartboyhw> Nicely:)

 15:21:55 <smartboyhw> valorie, which I did

 15:21:57 <smartboyhw> LOL

 15:21:58 <valorie> cool

 15:22:17 <Darkwing> JontheEchidna, jussi, any other questions?

 15:22:24 <jussi> hrm

 15:22:32 <smartboyhw> Do ask:)

 15:22:39 * smartboyhw is not worried about questions at all

 15:22:45 <jussi> Im good

 15:22:56 <JontheEchidna> Same, you two asked all of mine :P

 15:22:59 <smartboyhw> LOL

 15:23:03 * valorie shakes the pom poms

 15:23:49 <JontheEchidna> smartboyhw: so you were hoping for shadeslayer and yofel to give you testimonials, correct?

 15:23:59 <JontheEchidna> *give testimonials for you

 15:24:12 <smartboyhw> JontheEchidna, yep since they are supposed to be here (according to doodle poll)

 15:24:27 <smartboyhw> They did give them in my main Ubuntu membership application

 15:24:34 <JontheEchidna> ah, good

 15:24:44 <smartboyhw> Do you want links for that?

 15:24:51 <Darkwing> please

 15:25:43 <smartboyhw> Darkwing, JontheEchidna jussi http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/02/20/%23ubuntu-meeting.html (for main membership application)

 15:26:16 <smartboyhw> and for Riddell's +1 http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/03/10/%23kubuntu-devel.html#t09:56

 15:26:34 <yofel> he has indeed been a great help on the testing and packaging side and has been very active on the kubuntu side lately. So I'm all for this membership.

 15:26:36 <smartboyhw> Actually that's apachelogger:P

 15:26:43 <smartboyhw> Thanks yofel !

 15:27:31 <valorie> if I had a vote, you would have it

 15:27:37 <smartboyhw> valorie, thanks:)

 15:28:41 <jussi> smartboyhw: I have concerns about the length of time you have contributed to kubuntu directly - I admire the enthusiasm, but I want to see "sustained" contributions to *kubuntu*, so for me this time, it is a +0

 15:28:45 <jussi> +0

 15:28:49 <JontheEchidna> Darkwing: don't be sorry, I couldn't even start the stupid bot :P

 15:31:57 <valorie> is the mumble meeting still happening?

 15:31:59 <JontheEchidna> well, we do need a meeting to discuss the recent ... happenings in canonical land, but I think we'd want a more full attendence roster

 15:32:26 <Darkwing> JontheEchidna: I agree, we need to setup soemthing that all the council will be able to attend for that.

 15:32:29 <JontheEchidna> did the mumble meeting get a set date/time?

 15:32:39 <Darkwing> thanks to yofel we do have a mumble server running.

 15:32:41 <valorie> happenings are still happening, so there isn't a whole lot to discuss yet, I think

 15:32:55 <smartboyhw> I don't even know how to play with mumble:P

 15:32:58 <Darkwing> and no, I have not seen that email.

 15:33:18 <smartboyhw> Can someone give me yofel's server ip?

 15:33:25 <Darkwing> Actually, I have to set it up.
