 16:02:05 <zul> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:19 <zul> so was there any action points from the previous meeting?

 16:02:41 * zul is a little unprepared

 16:02:43 <jamespage> no

 16:02:47 <zul> sweet

 16:02:48 <smoser> well, there was one for me.

 16:02:54 <smoser> to contact release team about alpha2

 16:02:56 <smoser> which i have done.

 16:03:02 <zul> smoser: sweet!

 16:03:03 <jamespage> smoser: in which case I forgot to record it sorry

 16:03:23 <zul> so next

 16:03:32 <zul> #topic Raring Development

 16:03:40 <Daviey> smoser: do you want to drive this?

 16:04:04 <smoser> yeah

 16:04:05 <smoser> ok.

 16:04:50 <smoser> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:05:21 <smoser> that list looks reasonably well handled.

 16:05:41 <smoser> so, move on

 16:05:46 <smoser> alpha2 is thursday.

 16:06:00 <smoser> i believe that what we've agreed to do is to just tag cloud-images as alpha2

 16:06:07 <smoser> that will largely involve utlemming and i.

 16:06:23 <Daviey> (and a call for testing for ISO.)

 16:06:30 <smoser> utlemming you can make sure that our candiddate (daily) builds have what is necessary?

 16:06:35 <smoser> (yes, and call for testing ISO)

 16:06:54 <smoser> and then , get the ISO tracker populated and tests recorded and the like

 16:07:01 <smoser> (i can help utlemming on that)

 16:07:08 <utlemming> smoser: yup. We're ready in the build infrastruture department

 16:07:15 <smoser> we should send out a call for testing.

 16:07:28 <smoser> any one want to volunteer for that?

 16:07:29 <utlemming> smoser: and ISO tracking integration has been added already

 16:08:04 <Daviey> smoser: i'll do that.

 16:08:13 <smoser> ok. so just as long as we get stuff over there, and let the release team know the amis we want populated, i'm good with that.

 16:08:15 <smoser> thank you Daviey

 16:08:28 <smoser> #ACTION Daviey send request for testing

 16:08:28 * meetingology Daviey send request for testing

 16:08:49 <Daviey> roaksoax: How is MAAS looking in raring?

 16:10:13 <smoser> ok, we'll skip that repsonse maybe for general discussion section roaksoax

 16:10:21 <smoser> so, we're at alpha-2 in the cycle.

 16:10:44 <smoser> feature freeze is not too far off (March 7)

 16:10:46 <jamespage> sorry - I was distracting roaksoax elsewhere

 16:10:55 <smoser> be aware of that in your work.

 16:11:12 <smoser> #subtopic blueprints

 16:11:18 <smoser> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html

 16:12:02 <roaksoax> Daviey: its looking good. Now with SRU approval we should be getting things done pretty quickly

 16:12:03 <smoser> red are servercloud-r-openstack-ha, servercloud-r-openstack-grizzly, servercloud-r-image-access (smoser), servercloud-r-cloudarchive, servercloud-r-openstack-ubuntu-images

 16:12:21 <smoser> and servercloud-r-apt-improvements.

 16:12:28 <roaksoax> Daviey: so that will enable me to upload trunk to raring (since MAAS in raring is what is to be SRU'd)

 16:12:39 <smoser> so, pelease, if you are in charge of one of those , please make some effort to get it into shape

 16:12:48 <smoser> or to raise the fact that it might not be in good shape.

 16:13:09 <smoser> anything else for this topic ?

 16:13:12 <Daviey> -apt-improvements i fear will be postponed

 16:13:17 <Daviey> rbasak: ^?

 16:13:23 <smoser> i fear that indefinitely :-(

 16:14:19 <hallyn> fwiw, user namespaces will not be sufficiently enabled in the raring kernel.  we will have a kernel in a ppa for ~ubuntu-lxc for raring, and r+1 will have fully enabled usernamespaces.

 16:14:26 <hallyn> (this relates to a few items in the lxc blueprint)

 16:14:35 <Daviey> hallyn: :(

 16:14:45 <hallyn> oh it's ok, r+1 is so gonna rock

 16:14:51 <Daviey> \o/

 16:14:53 <hallyn> fully unprivileged creation and use of containers

 16:15:02 <zul> as long as the next lts rocks

 16:15:11 <hallyn> ooooh it will

 16:15:37 <zul> anything else?

 16:15:40 <smoser> hallyn, "fully unprivileged creation and use of containers" sounds crazy awesome.

 16:15:41 <rbasak> I hope to have the apt code done for feature freeze, but I'm not sure it'll go into raring in time for review. But I'm hoping that it'll land when S opens at the latest

 16:16:10 <smoser> rbasak, well, please remember that shoving it into R to be optionally enabled is quite preferable

 16:16:11 <jamespage> zul: re the tracking report; I checked the package list

 16:16:19 <rbasak> smoser: ack

 16:16:21 <smoser> so that it makes it easier for people to test.

 16:16:28 <smoser> and doesn't hurt anything.

 16:16:28 <jamespage> it looks OK - I'll ping round an email with how to make stuff appear on it.

 16:16:34 <rbasak> The catch is the desire for ABI compatibility in Debian

 16:16:37 <zul> which package list?

 16:16:57 <rbasak> Since I need to modify libapt slightly

 16:17:38 <jamespage> zul: the list of packages that is maintained for the release tracking report (packages -> teams)

 16:17:46 <zul> ah

 16:17:56 <jamespage> (that is going to change to subs)

 16:18:25 <zul> so i guess its time for a topic change

 16:18:37 <zul> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:18:44 <zul> any upcoming events?

 16:19:12 <zul> ODS and UDS will be here sooner to bite you on the bum

 16:19:26 <Daviey> Yes, moving on :)

 16:19:30 <arosales> scale11x upcoming

 16:19:39 <arosales> MongoDB Austin this Friday :-)

 16:19:49 <Daviey> be there or be relational

 16:19:57 <zul> hah

 16:19:59 * jamespage will be relational then

 16:20:11 <arosales> I'll be there giving a Juju talk around Juan's sharding blog

 16:20:17 <jamespage> arosales: nice one

 16:20:19 <Daviey> Oh nice!

 16:20:33 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:20:38 <zul> hi hggdh you here?

 16:21:25 <zul> if not

 16:21:36 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:21:39 <smb> More or less was busy with Xen (two issues in Precise, security updates in its package, preparing related security updates in the kernel). There was also some bug smoser had for me but I believe that was something I was nothing I could help further and promptly forgot what that was... :/ Oh, autoloading of some  special net hw modules. I believe the net part has been at least added to some udebs (Precise?) So are there other questions?

 16:21:40 <zul> hi smb are you here?

 16:21:43 <smb> ..

 16:21:49 <smb> zul, yes

 16:22:01 <zul> smb:  silly cut and paste

 16:22:17 <smb> zul, Nah, prewrite and press enter. :)

 16:22:23 <zul> uh huh :)

 16:22:25 <smoser> yes, smb helped me with bug 1115710 and (related)_ bug 1015339.

 16:22:29 <ubottu> bug 1115710 in module-init-tools (Ubuntu Quantal) "Mellanox mlx4_en network driver is not automatically loaded" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1115710

 16:22:30 <ubottu> bug 1015339 in linux (Ubuntu Quantal) "installer initrd missing kernel modules for Mellanox ConnectX HCA Ethernet" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1015339

 16:22:47 <zul> anything else for smb and his prewrite awesomeoness?

 16:23:33 <zul> ok then

 16:23:42 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:23:50 <zul> i know rbasak is around

 16:24:06 <zul> or his evil twin

 16:24:10 <zul> who is french

 16:24:30 <zul> rbasak: any update?

 16:25:00 <rbasak> Sorry

 16:25:14 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. Any questions for me?

 16:25:44 <zul> if not

 16:26:02 <zul> #topic Open Discussion

 16:26:15 <zul> so anyone else has something on the agenda?

 16:26:22 <pmatulis> yes

 16:26:46 <zul> pmatulis: ?

 16:27:01 <pmatulis> we need to improve the ubuntu server guide.  seems the way we're doing it now doesn't work

 16:27:40 <pmatulis> i'm afraid it will become obsolete in a few cycles if things don't improve

 16:28:43 <zul> pmatulis: why not put out a call to volunteers again on the ubuntu-server mailing list

 16:29:09 <pmatulis> zul: i did, last week, no one responded

 16:29:14 <rbasak> pmatulis: what do you propose?

 16:29:55 <pmatulis> rbasak: i've tried to create ways to focus on the guide

 16:30:20 <pmatulis> but it doesn't seem to be bearing any fruit

 16:31:08 <pmatulis> today i created a special team with an associated mailing list.  which i hope to use to awaken prior contributors every cycle

 16:31:54 <pmatulis> fyi, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/UbuntuServerGuide

 16:32:07 <hallyn> test team has worked hard to try and force test additions corresponding to each (UDS) feature item and each SRU item, perhaps we can do something analogous where we collect server guide updates in response to each?

 16:32:19 <hallyn> don't require a server guide update for each, just collect items,

 16:32:33 <hallyn> which then a team can go over (and contact the item author if needed)

 16:33:50 <hallyn> <crickets>

 16:34:01 <hallyn> i'd say such an undertaking could stand to have a UDS discussion

 16:34:09 <jamespage> indeed

 16:34:22 <pmatulis> hallyn: that's an idea, link guide contributions to UDS discussions

 16:34:27 <hallyn> (in the meantime, a simple stern "make sure you update server guide for anything you've been working on")

 16:34:38 <hallyn> pmatulis: even put them in the blueprints,

 16:34:48 <pmatulis> right

 16:34:50 <hallyn> next to the release notes maybe.

 16:35:07 <rbasak> Perhaps we should have a standard "upgrade server guide" in every blueprint where it makes sense

 16:35:14 <rbasak> update server guide that is

 16:35:40 <jamespage> I think making it a milestoned work item makes alot of sense

 16:35:59 <jamespage> then you won't get i***ts like me updating stuff a week before release cause its wrong

 16:36:57 <jamespage> OK _ I'll take an action to add something to the blueprint template - basically a check to see if docs need updating

 16:36:57 <hallyn> where would it fit though?  I don't think that

 16:37:07 <hallyn> having one week where we try to remember the last six months' worth of changes works

 16:37:25 <hallyn> hm yeah, that's a good start

 16:37:29 <jamespage> well a milestone would indicate the point at which document updates must have been made by

 16:37:34 <jamespage> not when you actually do the,

 16:37:36 <jamespage> :-)

 16:37:45 <jamespage> pmatulis: I'm right in saying there is a cutoff?

 16:37:45 <hallyn> haha

 16:38:21 <jamespage> zul: care to action me todo that?

 16:38:25 <pmatulis> jamespage: yes, there is actually a 'string freeze'

 16:38:32 <zul> jamespage:  sure

 16:38:32 <jamespage> thats the one

 16:38:45 <zul> #action jamespage to milesone documentation updates

 16:38:45 * meetingology jamespage to milesone documentation updates

 16:39:46 <zul> anything else?

 16:40:37 <zul> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:40:50 <zul> next week, same time, same place and someone else will be the chair

 16:40:53 <zul> whee!

 16:40:58 <zul> thanks for coming

 16:41:00 <zul> #endmeeting
