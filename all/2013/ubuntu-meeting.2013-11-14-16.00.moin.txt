 16:00 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Lightning round

 16:01 <slangasek> a few people missing today due to the Debian Miniconf is Cambridge... so I guess this'll be a short one :)

 16:01 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber jodh bdmurray slangasek cjwatson xnox stokachu)

 16:01 <slangasek> cjwatson jodh xnox stokachu stgraber doko slangasek barry bdmurray

 16:01 <slangasek> jodh: you're first!

 16:01 <jodh> * upstart

 16:01 <jodh> - Working on overcoming ptrace limitations tests

 16:01 <jodh> - Resolving some test issues:

 16:01 <jodh> - lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/cleanup-test-xdg-dirs

 16:01 <jodh> - lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/fix-test_state-test-reprise

 16:01 <jodh> - Test micro enhancement: lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/test-upstart-name

 16:01 <jodh> - Upstart 1.11 release.

 16:01 <jodh> * TODO

 16:01 <jodh> - Get upstart 1.11 into the archive.

 16:01 <jodh> - continue ptrace work.

 16:01 <jodh> ⽶

 16:02 <stgraber> xnox is in cambridge and stokachu doesn't appear to be around, so I guess that's my turn then

 16:02 <slangasek> \o/

 16:02 <slangasek> stokachu: are you not around?

 16:03 <slangasek> stokachu: go ahead :)

 16:04 <slangasek> stgraber: I meant stgraber, not stokachu, curse the tab completion ;)

 16:04 <stgraber> :)

 16:04 <stgraber> - SRU

 16:04 <stgraber> - SecureBoot SRU testing in precise, quantal, raring and saucy.

 16:04 <stgraber> - I've been going through pending-sru and the queues a couple times a day for the past few days, trying to get everything under control.

 16:04 <stgraber> - Merges

 16:04 <stgraber> - Made progress on the resolvconf merge.

 16:04 <stgraber> - Working on a few others (busybox, ifupdown, installation-report, libdebian-installer, nbd and netcfg)

 16:04 <stgraber> - System images

 16:04 <stgraber> - Tracked down a couple of system-images bug (related to image revert and copies)

 16:04 <stgraber> - Wrote some test code for the new generators (needed to support ports)

 16:04 <stgraber> - ARM

 16:04 <stgraber> - Added support for the wandboard in our kernel, flash-kernel and d-i

 16:04 <stgraber> - Reworked the way the armhf images are generated to use devicetree, the current u-boot, use a single d-i build for all the boards using the generic image (cut build time by half) and publish the board images to a new sub-directory.

 16:04 <stgraber> Example: https://www.stgraber.org/download/d-i/

 16:04 <stgraber> - LXC

 16:04 <stgraber> - Backported current saucy-updates LXC and libseccomp to all supported releases.

 16:04 <stgraber> - Code reviews and discussion in LXC upstream, postponed alpha3 a bit as I want to see a few issues with lxc-info fixed first.

 16:05 <stgraber> - Other

 16:05 <stgraber> - Booked trip to London for the Core sprint.

 16:05 <stgraber> - Some vUDS prep

 16:05 <stgraber> (DONE)

 16:05 <doko> - ongoing component-mismatch work (50 perl libs)

 16:05 <doko> - MIR processing, pestering

 16:05 <doko> - toolchain work

 16:05 <stokachu> slangasek: yep sorry finishing up juju meeting

 16:05 <doko> (done)

 16:06 <stokachu> no on fire issues \o/, finished python3 port of sosreport, buried in maas/juju issues (done)

 16:06 <slangasek> stgraber: what's the wandboard?

 16:07 <stgraber> slangasek: imx6 quadcore, 2GB of RAM, gigabit ethernet and SATA. That's my new armhf sbuild/LXC box

 16:07 <slangasek> hmm, ok

 16:07 <slangasek> so we have imx.6 support in the kernel?  Is that part of arm mp?

 16:08 <stgraber> yep, the generic 3.12 kernel supports it

 16:08 <stgraber> all I had to do was get the kernel team to turn on the generation of the dtb file and get flash-kernel and d-i to detect the board properly

 16:08 <slangasek> (and the necessary hardware support is enabled in our kernel build in the archive?)

 16:08 <slangasek> ah, alrighty

 16:09 <stgraber> so the only difference in the published d-i tree is what dtb is appended to the kernel of each of the boards, besides that, everything is identical

 16:09 <slangasek> stokachu: python3> yay!  Is that in the archive now?

 16:09 * slangasek nods to stgraber

 16:09 <stokachu> slangasek: our 3.1 milestone is set for Feb 2014 which will have that

 16:09 <stokachu> but yea sosreport is in main

 16:09 <slangasek> stokachu: I meant is the python3 support in the archive :)

 16:09 <stokachu> ah lol sorry long nights

 16:09 <stokachu> not yet

 16:10 <slangasek> so we can drop python2 from main with a vengeance!

 16:10 <barry> \o/

 16:10 <stokachu> slangasek: definately, major motivation is to have it in the cloud images

 16:10 * slangasek wonders if we should talk to the MIR team about blocking any more python2 deps from main

 16:10 <barry> slangasek: radical

 16:10 <slangasek> * very short week: public holiday Monday, jury duty Tuesday

 16:10 <slangasek> * most of the rest of the time spent catching up

 16:10 <slangasek> * internal discussions about various ongoing and upcoming projects

 16:10 <slangasek> * prep for vUDS next week

 16:10 <slangasek> * started cleaning up unverified SRUs

 16:10 <slangasek> * TODO:

 16:10 <slangasek> * upstart 1.11 into Debian unstable

 16:10 <slangasek> * finish the horrible isdnutils merge so we can drop archaic versions of automake

 16:11 <stgraber> has openstack switched to python3 by default now? otherwise blocking new python2 deps in main is going to be tricky...

 16:11 <slangasek> (done)

 16:11 <stokachu> stgraber: still relies on python2

 16:11 <stokachu> thats going to be a huge migration i think

 16:12 <stokachu> slangasek: i can find out what upstream is doing

 16:12 <stokachu> i know canonical isn't doing any python3 porting atm

 16:12 <barry> stokachu: let us know

 16:13 <stokachu> barry: will do have it added as an action item

 16:13 <slangasek> ok

 16:13 <slangasek> any other questions over statuseses?

 16:15 <slangasek> [TOPIC] vUDS

 16:15 <slangasek> vUDS is next week

 16:15 <slangasek> everyone ready? :)

 16:15 <barry> um, kind of ;)

 16:15 <stgraber> I guess so

 16:15 <slangasek> formally, there are still a few slots available on the calendar... but I guess everyone's schedules are already quite full

 16:16 <slangasek> but if there are any sessions that you think still need to be added, we can squeeze them in

 16:16 <slangasek> I just won't move other sessions around to make room for them, so :)

 16:17 <slangasek> Cadastrar funcionário administrativo - hmm, I'm probably not approving that blueprint for UDS

 16:18 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:18 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:18 <slangasek> so I think everybody had a chance last cycle to present on a topic during the meeting

 16:19 <slangasek> should we continue that this cycle?  Does anyone have particular topics they'd like to talk about?

 16:20 <stokachu> when's the kernel getting re-written in go? :X

 16:21 <stgraber> I think it was a good thing, though I personally don't have any topics at this point (as I already presented the two things I'm most involved with these days)

 16:21 <barry> i liked hear about other things folks were working on

 16:22 <stokachu> slangasek: will there be a meeting week of thanksgiving?

 16:22 <slangasek> stokachu: nope

 16:22 <stokachu> slangasek: thanks

 16:22 <slangasek> well, unless the non-Americans want to meet without us, but then I guess it's not a meeting you'd want to attend anyway :)

 16:22 <stokachu> haha

 16:22 <barry> how about during vuds?

 16:22 <slangasek> the meeting time falls during the UDS block, right?

 16:23 <slangasek> so I guess that's also a "no" for next week

 16:23 <slangasek> so... next meeting in December :)

 16:23 <barry> see you guys in december then!

 16:23 <stokachu> \o/

 16:23 <slangasek> anyway, sounds like no one's dying to present right now the exciting thing they're working on, but we do like having the presentations

 16:24 <slangasek> I'll work on getting topics put together in time for the next meeting then

 16:25 <slangasek> #endmeeting
