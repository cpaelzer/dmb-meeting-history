 16:01 <roaksoax> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <roaksoax> (carried over) arosales: create a overview topic bp for servercloud

 16:02 <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-servercloud-overview.html

 16:02 <roaksoax> arosales: o/! ^^

 16:02 <arosales> roaksoax, done

 16:02 <roaksoax> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-servercloud-overview.html

 16:02 <Daviey> arosales: hurray!

 16:03 <Daviey> super job.

 16:03 <roaksoax> moving on: everyone look over blueprints one more time

 16:03 <roaksoax> so I'm guessing that we all looked at our BP's once again

 16:03 <roaksoax> moving on

 16:03 <roaksoax> #action rbasak to follow up on go 1.1. saucy arm issue

 16:03 * meetingology rbasak to follow up on go 1.1. saucy arm issue

 16:03 <roaksoax> rbasak: any updates?

 16:03 <arosales> sorry for the delay on the topic bp

 16:04 <Daviey> roaksoax: MAAS is still needing completion ?

 16:04 <Daviey> smoser: FPI?

 16:04 <roaksoax> Daviey: needs the user stories

 16:04 <jamespage> o/

 16:05 <smoser> hm.

 16:05 <rbasak> Sorry for the delay. I've just been catching up with infinity in #ubuntu-devel.

 16:05 <rbasak> His view is that we need to fix golang, and then modify dpkg-shlibdeps to pick up the ELF header slightly differently. So still in progress.

 16:06 <roaksoax> ok then

 16:06 <roaksoax> let's move on

 16:06 <roaksoax> rbasak consider telling hallyn to add a todo item to meeting checklist to remind meeting chair about the wiki page checklist

 16:06 <rbasak> Is there any particular need that we need this fixed faster than a proper fix? I have a workaround in mind that may work, but we don't want to spend time on it unless there's an urgent need.

 16:06 <rbasak> Done

 16:06 <rbasak> I put the reminder at the end of the agenda.

 16:06 * smoser moved that from draftingo to review

 16:07 <Daviey> and approved.

 16:07 <roaksoax> ok, so let's move on

 16:07 <roaksoax> #topic Saucy Development

 16:07 <roaksoax> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <roaksoax> So I'm guessing that everybody saw the email about the changes in the Release Schedule

 16:08 <roaksoax> and FF has been moved to BetaFreeze

 16:08 <roaksoax> any other updates anyone would like to raise, or I shall move on to the release bugs

 16:09 <roaksoax> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <roaksoax> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-s-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:09 <roaksoax> bug #1188788

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1188788 in quantum (Ubuntu Raring) "Meta bug for tracking Openstack 2013.1.2 Stable Update" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1188788

 16:09 <roaksoax> any updates?

 16:10 <roaksoax> adam_g_: ^^

 16:10 <roaksoax> zul: ^^

 16:10 <Daviey> That i believe is blocked on me.

 16:10 <Daviey> Requires SRU review, was superseded by a security upload

 16:11 <adam_g_> roaksoax, ya just waiting to get approved out of queue into -proposed

 16:12 <roaksoax> Awesome. MAAS bugs #1171418 #1171988  are also waiting to be approved

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1171418 in MAAS 1.2 "MAAS fails to power up machines when trying to install nodes" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1171418

 16:12 <roaksoax> bug #1162139

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1162139 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Raring) "mysql-5.5 still built using GCC-4.4, should be built with the default GCC" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1162139

 16:13 <roaksoax> this seems target to raring and should probably be re-targetted to saucy

 16:13 <roaksoax> any thought

 16:13 <Daviey> Oh, most certainly

 16:13 <rbasak> Debian have agreed to drop the gcc-4.4 build dep now.

 16:14 <rbasak> So we either wait for Debian, or jump ahead.

 16:14 <roaksoax> rbasak: I believe this would need your verification:

 16:15 <roaksoax> bug #1173265

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1173265 in facter (Ubuntu Raring) "facter fails to run from rebuilt source package" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1173265

 16:15 <roaksoax> and bug #1170325

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1170325 in facter (Ubuntu Raring) "Facter 1.6.X not considering Qemu/KVM virtual type" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1170325

 16:15 <rbasak> The former is easy to verify: it built.

 16:15 <rbasak> The latter is trickier. Does anyone have a suitable machine?

 16:15 <rbasak> I used a hack to test my proposed upload for quantal and raring, but it doesn't work with precise.

 16:16 <roaksoax> boomer, anyone would like to verify that one?

 16:17 <roaksoax> in the meantime, bug #1172742

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1172742 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Raring) "maas datasource fails if no user-data" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1172742

 16:17 <roaksoax> smoser: any updates?

 16:18 <roaksoax> alright I guess he might have stepped out for a bit

 16:18 <roaksoax> let's move on

 16:18 <roaksoax> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:20 <roaksoax> zul: ^^

 16:20 <roaksoax> yolanda: ^^ any updates?

 16:20 <zul> no

 16:20 <smoser> no updates to that bug.

 16:20 <yolanda> i'm dealing with server banners, mostly with dovecot, bind9

 16:20 <yolanda> there is a pending MP for dovecot

 16:21 <roaksoax> alright

 16:21 <roaksoax> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-juju-2-delivery

 16:21 <roaksoax> jamespage: any updateS?

 16:21 <jamespage> roaksoax, not really - Ill be working with the juju team this week to a) get py juju removed from saucy

 16:21 <jamespage> and by get the latest juju-core uploaded

 16:22 <roaksoax> \o/

 16:22 <roaksoax> awesome then!

 16:22 <roaksoax> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms-ha-v2

 16:22 <Daviey> jamespage: shall i just go ahead and remove pyjuju now?

 16:22 <jamespage> yeah

 16:22 <jamespage> I acked the bug

 16:22 <Daviey> ta

 16:23 <roaksoax> on the HA stack side, I discussed with the debian maintainer about the new upstream changes and the things that we would need to consider dropping soonish, and he wasn't so keen on doing it now

 16:23 <m_3> RIP juju-0.7

 16:23 <roaksoax> so it seems that we might keep support for older stuff longer, but will be moving the charms to the newer stack options

 16:24 <roaksoax> should be pretty straight forward though

 16:24 <roaksoax> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-hypervisor

 16:24 <roaksoax> zul: ^^ updates?

 16:24 <zul> nope

 16:26 <jamespage> havana cloud archive is open btw

 16:26 <roaksoax> awesome!

 16:26 <jamespage> which reminds me - we need a blast on getting everything lined up in staging

 16:26 <jamespage> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/cloud-archive/havana_versions.html

 16:27 <Daviey> Users have started asking about Havana in UCA

 16:27 <jamespage> zul, is that something you can coordinate over the next 24 hrs?

 16:27 <jamespage> it would be nice to flush something through to proposed on thurs/friday

 16:28 <zul> jamespage:  yeah im just finishing off quantum fbtfs today

 16:28 <zul> been distracted with other things

 16:28 <jamespage> excellent

 16:29 <roaksoax> alright! Any other BP

 16:29 <roaksoax> alright! Any other BP that any of you would like to discuss?

 16:29 <roaksoax> guess not then

 16:29 <roaksoax> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:29 <roaksoax> any upcoming events?

 16:30 <Daviey> None. Move on :)

 16:30 <arosales> not any in the next weeks

 16:30 <arosales> OSCON is the next up on July 22

 16:30 <m_3> poolside siesta doesn't count?  harumph

 16:31 <roaksoax> heh

 16:31 <arosales> m_3, it does if there is an invite

 16:31 <arosales> :-)

 16:31 <roaksoax> ok, let's move on then

 16:31 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:31 <roaksoax> plars: any updates?

 16:31 <plars> hi

 16:31 <plars> yes, one thing I wanted to ask about

 16:32 <plars> we recently had some issues with lxc and ceph tests

 16:32 <plars> ceph was supposed to be disabled I think, but the job got accidentally recreated when some jenkins refresh scripts ran

 16:32 <plars> but had been running fine since then

 16:32 <plars> but I think I heard that jamespage said that it was flaky and not to be trusted?

 16:32 <jamespage> yes indeed

 16:32 <hallyn> yeah it's being pulled

 16:33 <plars> lxc is working fine again, but it is a similar situation?

 16:33 <hallyn> plars: no it's not a similar situation

 16:33 <plars> ok, we'll pull ceph from our scripts that regenerate the jobs too if we're sure we don't want those

 16:33 <hallyn> plars: the lxc failures i believe were due to either utah or hw problems

 16:33 <plars> is there no replacement?

 16:33 <hallyn> plars: I could never reproduce the lxc failures locally

 16:33 <plars> ok, fair enough

 16:34 <hallyn> plars: this cycle I want to move the distro lxc tests into upstream, and then probably move them out of utah

 16:34 <plars> hallyn: you mean as autopkgtests?

 16:34 <hallyn> not yet sure what i mean

 16:34 <plars> heh

 16:34 <hallyn> other than upstream lxc git tree woudl have the tests

 16:34 <plars> ok, but I still think it would make sense to run them in the image right? to validate what's installed?

 16:35 <hallyn> somehwere, yes

 16:35 <hallyn> but it would then amount to pulling down the tree and running make distro-test or something

 16:35 <plars> ok, just let me know if there are any changes and I'll remove the ceph tests from our script unless there are plans to update/replace them

 16:35 <hallyn> plars: yup, thx

 16:35 <plars> that's it from me

 16:36 <roaksoax> thank you plars

 16:36 <roaksoax> let's move on

 16:36 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:36 <smb> As mentioned last week the Saucy kernel will move to 3.10. If things go like intended the upload will happen end of this week when dkms testing has been done. Repeat: Saucy kernel will be 3.10. And ogasawara has some more notes on dkms testing...

 16:36 <Daviey> smb: Do you know where these notes are?

 16:36 <ogasawara> so I wanted to inquire if the dkms package the server team cares about has been tested?

 16:36 <Daviey> ogasawara: No.

 16:36 <smb> Daviey, There ^

 16:36 <ogasawara> also, could I get that list of dkms packages you guys care about as well?

 16:37 <ogasawara> as I want to pass that along to QA for the automated testing we're trying to set up

 16:37 <Daviey> ogasawara: That is super, I will make sure you get the list by EOD>

 16:37 <Daviey> Thanks.

 16:37 <ogasawara> Daviey: thanks.  will you guys be able to test with the 3.10 kernel before we upload?

 16:38 <lifeless> openvswitch-datapath-dkms :)

 16:38 <ogasawara> Daviey: or should we just plan to upload and deal with any fallout?

 16:38 <jamespage> lifeless, indeed - that won't work

 16:38 <jamespage> but I can pick up testing of that

 16:38 <Daviey> ogasawara: It would be really nice if between kernel and QA team a simple apt-get install openvswitch-datapath-dkms, could be done

 16:38 <jamespage> (and the fixes)

 16:38 <ogasawara> Daviey: I was hoping that would be a task you're team would own

 16:39 <ogasawara> Daviey: and we provide the test kernel

 16:39 <ogasawara> Daviey: https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/pre-proposed

 16:39 <Daviey> ogasawara: I was more hoping that between kernel and QA team it could be done :)

 16:39 <ogasawara> Daviey: it would appear we are at an impass :)  maybe we can sort off line.

 16:39 <Daviey> But sure, OK.  But going forwards it would be great if it could be handled between your teams

 16:40 <ogasawara> Daviey: going forward we indeed will work with QA.  But that will just be for the initial build and install testing.  We'll still look to team and maintainers to fix up any issues.

 16:40 <Daviey> ogasawara: right, resolving issues we are happy to do

 16:40 <Daviey> but early warning, would be nice if the issues were fed to us from QA/kernel

 16:41 <ogasawara> Daviey: so for us to do that now without the automation in place yet, I need your package list

 16:41 <Daviey> Yes sir.  But sure, OK - this kernel we'll do.. and get serious about automating it between us.

 16:42 <ogasawara> Daviey: thanks

 16:42 <Daviey> Superb

 16:42 <roaksoax> Awesome outcome. Let's move on then!

 16:42 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:42 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. Just the golang armhf FTBFS in bug 1187722 that is ongoing. Is there any particular need for which we need this fixed faster than the proper fix? I have a workaround in mind that may work, but we don't want to spend time on it unless there's an urgent need.

 16:42 <ubottu> bug 1187722 in golang (Ubuntu) "dpkg-shlibdeps fails on armhf ELF binaries that do not define architecture specific information" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1187722

 16:43 <rbasak> I'll assume it can wait for a proper fix then?

 16:44 <rbasak> Any other questions for me?

 16:44 <rbasak> Linaro Connect is 8-12 July BTW. I'll be going.

 16:44 <rbasak> I guess no questions then. Thanks roaksoax!

 16:44 <roaksoax> thank you!

 16:44 <roaksoax> #topic Open Discussion

 16:44 <roaksoax> anyone has something to share with us?

 16:45 <roaksoax> i guess not

 16:45 <roaksoax> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:45 <roaksoax> same time and place

 16:45 <Daviey> Thanks roaksoax

 16:46 <roaksoax> the next chair according to the list is arosales

 16:46 <roaksoax> arosales: you';ve been selected to be our chair next week :) Thanks in advance

 16:46 <roaksoax> I'll end this

 16:46 <roaksoax> #endmeeting
