 17:02:26 <meetingology> Current chairs: czajkowski dholbach

 17:02:56 <dholbach> so for today's meeting we just have "Ask the CC" on the agenda (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda)

 17:03:21 <dholbach> I haven't been part of any of these yet, so I guess I'll just ask if there's questions from anyone here? :)

 17:03:38 <dholbach> #topic Ask the CC

 17:03:53 <czajkowski> nobody?

 17:04:05 <czajkowski> well the catch up with the governance boards has been useful

 17:04:21 <dholbach> yeah :)

 17:04:22 <czajkowski> but anyone can always ask the CC stuff or raise any issues.

 17:04:58 <dholbach> it's not entirely Community Council related, but I'd like to just quickly mention something I blogged about yesterday

 17:05:13 <dholbach> some have noticed that in the redesign of the ubuntu.com page, the "Community" link went missing

 17:05:40 <dholbach> and there's work underway (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityWebsite has more details) to set up a more exciting, more up-to-date and more inviting page

 17:05:50 <dholbach> where we're still looking for some help to get it all nice and updated

 17:06:01 <dholbach> once that's up and running, the link will be put back again

 17:06:11 <dholbach> so if anyone of you is interested in that, please let me know :)

 17:06:57 <dholbach> Any other questions?

 17:07:03 <czajkowski> yes it would be nice if people helped if possible

 17:07:33 <dholbach> I guess if nobody has questions now, we could still answer them via mail and then blog them or something.

 17:07:42 <czajkowski> dholbach: sounds good to me

 17:07:57 <dholbach> I guess we can't wait a few more mins and then move over to mail

 17:10:22 <czajkowski> and the loco council nominations comes to a close tomorrow

 17:10:28 <czajkowski> so they'll be mailed to the CC

 17:10:36 <dholbach> ah, great

 17:10:51 <czajkowski> shall we call it a day

 17:10:51 <dholbach> all right... I think we'll wrap it here then

 17:11:05 <dholbach> tomorrow I'll include it in our team report, so people get another chance to see the call for questions

 17:11:10 <dholbach> all right everyone

 17:11:11 <czajkowski> toodles

 17:11:13 <dholbach> have a great rest of your day
