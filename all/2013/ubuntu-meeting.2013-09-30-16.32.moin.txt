 16:32 <jdstrand_> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Meeting

 16:32 <jdstrand_> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:32 <jdstrand_> I'll go first

 16:33 <jdstrand_> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:34 <mdeslaur> you do indeed look happy

 16:34 <jdstrand_> I'm working on an apaprmor-easyprof-ubuntu upload which should finish out all the policy/reserved vs common policy groups/etc. I'm waiting for bug #1231863 to be fixed before uploading

 16:34 <ubottu> bug 1231863 in ubuntu-ui-toolkit (Ubuntu Saucy) "Local Sqlite databases are still created/stored in incorrect location" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1231863

 16:34 <jdstrand_> heh

 16:35 <jdstrand_> I also am doing stuff with appstore reviews this week-- various updates for recent changes

 16:35 <jdstrand_> including working with SDK team on filing path bugs against apps now that they are fixed

 16:36 <jdstrand_> "now that they are fixed" referes to the path bugs being fixed in the sdk

 16:36 <sbeattie> \o/

 16:36 <jdstrand_> but apps are now broken-- so I am going to enumerate them

 16:36 <jdstrand_> also continue various followups on https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+bugs?field.tag=application-confinement bugs

 16:37 <jdstrand_> I have some patch piloting to do

 16:37 <jdstrand_> and think there is a decent chance I might pick up an update this week

 16:37 * jdstrand_ crosses fingers

 16:37 <jdstrand_> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I have a short week as I'm off thursday and friday

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I'm about to push out a few USNs

 16:38 <mdeslaur> and I have a bunch more in our PPA that are in the testing phase

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I may get to a couple more before thursday

 16:38 <mdeslaur> that's about it

 16:38 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:38 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor again this week, trying to offload work from jjohansen

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm poking at the very early ipc prototype kernel he got me, now that I finally got it booting :/

 16:40 <sbeattie> I also need to followup with jdstrand on the hardware apparmor policy proposal he had made earlier.

 16:40 <sbeattie> and I need to track down why the parser commits broke both my jenkins build and the daily apparmor ppa builds

 16:40 <tyhicks> uh oh

 16:41 <sbeattie> I think it's the newly added dependency on libapparmor for the parser build

 16:41 <sbeattie> (but we don't need to solve that here)

 16:41 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me; tyhicks, you're up

 16:41 <jjohansen> oh, yeah likely, sorry

 16:42 <tyhicks> I'm testing dbus, apparmor, and evince uploads that fix several bugs

 16:42 <tyhicks> One of the fixes in dbus-daemon looks like it may affect some of the dbus policy in apparmor-easyprof-ubuntu, so I'll need to coordinate w/ jdstrand

 16:42 <tyhicks> Then I've got an embargoed issue to work on

 16:42 <tyhicks> Then I've got one more dbus bug to fix (bug #1229280)

 16:42 <ubottu> bug 1229280 in dbus (Ubuntu) "Eavesdroppers confined with AppArmor can see all method_return and error messages" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1229280

 16:43 <tyhicks> I think that's it for me

 16:43 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:44 <jjohansen> I'll be working on more apparmor IPC mediation this week

 16:45 <jjohansen> hrmm I think that is about it for me sarnold your up

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> jjohansen, oh, i've been looking at your earlier ping

 16:46 <jdstrand_> I'm not sure sarnold is here yet. chrisccoulson feel free to go ahead

 16:46 <sarnold> (hello :)

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> jjohansen, http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr24/rev/16e20df57d08 is what removed the ability to set the Follow-Up header

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> anyway

 16:47 <jjohansen> chrisccoulson: thanks for looking

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> this week, i'll hopefully be getting back to my oxide bug / feature list :)

 16:47 <jdstrand_> sarnold: ah, didn't see you come in :)

 16:47 <sarnold> jdstrand_: heh, that was me coming in :) sorry.

 16:47 <jdstrand_> no need to be sorry

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> we've got pretty good test coverage for the actual API now, although i'm still adding bits (and fixing bugs as I find them)

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 16:48 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: any progress on the nss ftbfs?

 16:48 <mdeslaur> although I guess it's a little late now to get it in saucy

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, oh, i need to get back to that. sorry. i've got my pandaboard all set up here again now so I've got a bit more flexibility with the test environment

 16:49 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: cool, thanks

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> i planned to roll back some of the recent updates to see when it fails. the main suspects are gcc, binutils and eglibc, which were all updated since the last time it worked

 16:51 * mdeslaur rolls dice

 16:51 <mdeslaur> gcc!

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> heh

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, it doesn't matter which one it is. they're all doko's packages anyway :)

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> that's why i picked them out as suspects ;)

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> (just kidding btw)

 16:52 <jdstrand_> heh

 16:52 <jdstrand_> chrisccoulson: did you have more to report?

 16:53 <mdeslaur> hehe

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand_, no, i'm done

 16:53 <jdstrand_> sarnold: you're up

 16:53 <sarnold> I'm on community this week, and have two more MIR audits to finish up, MIR and open-vm-tools; I would very much like to do both of them this week, but Mir is a large and complicated codebase, I may not make enough progress to finish both this week.

 16:54 <sarnold> s/MIR and/Mir and/

 16:54 <sarnold> at least the unity-system-compositor was written in idiomatic c++11, which isn't one of my strong languages, so the going was slower than I'd like.

 16:55 <sarnold> but hey I'm getting to learn c++11 while I'm at it, and that's fun. :)

 16:55 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, jdstrand_ back to you

 16:55 <jdstrand_> :)

 16:55 <mdeslaur> sarnold: you've been redefining the word "fun" again, haven't you? :)

 16:55 * jdstrand_ hugs sarnold

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> sarnold, want to port chromium to c++11?

 16:56 <sbeattie> sarnold: when you're done, can you teach me those bits of c++11?

 16:56 <sbeattie> mdeslaur: he overloaded the fun operator.

 16:56 <mdeslaur> return True;

 16:56 <sarnold> mdeslaur: lol :) yes, just operator_fun() { ... } and away you go!

 16:56 <sarnold> chrisccoulson: nothanks :)

 16:56 <chrisccoulson> heh

 16:57 <jdstrand_> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
