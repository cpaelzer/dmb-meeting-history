 16:13:54 <ev> Geez! Hurry up, slangasek. I want to make a tea.

 16:14:06 <slangasek> ev: :P

 16:14:24 <ogra_> just make a strong tea then :)

 16:15:44 <slangasek> * travel last week through Wednesday, then was out sick over the weekend + Monday with the flu, so little to report

 16:15:47 <slangasek> * have been working to help the Kylin team get oriented so they can meet alpha2 for 13.04

 16:16:34 <cjwatson> Build fixes: pyparted (with Tim), sivp, gnumeric

 16:16:35 <cjwatson> 12.04.2: Switched to X enablement stack for relevant images; cleaned up various associated issues due to having to use metapackages.

 16:16:38 <cjwatson> Phased updates: Reviewed spec and discussed with ev/bdmurray/wgrant; fixed up some glitches in update-manager; started on Launchpad implementation.

 16:16:41 <cjwatson> Cross-building: Further work on backporting architecture qualifier support to Debian buildds; met up with Wookey for status check.

 16:16:44 <cjwatson> Continued work on removing nested functions from GRUB.

 16:16:46 <cjwatson> Hard thinking about the situation where the language and location selected during installation don't identify a valid locale (bug 1094872).

 16:16:52 <cjwatson> ..

 16:17:29 <ev> - Continued work on the prodstack error tracker deployment.

 16:17:29 <ev> - I've moved my testing over to EC2 from canonistack. Between the resource

 16:17:29 <ev> limits (I couldn't spawn 15+ instances) and frequently getting instances in

 16:17:29 <ev> the error state, canonistack was really slowing me down.

 16:17:29 <ev> We need to fix this though. EC2 is expensive ($15 for two days usage), and

 16:17:29 <ev> the error tracker infrastructure now cannot fit on canonistack without

 16:17:29 <ev> modifying people's resource limits, which hinders our ability to test and

 16:17:30 <ev> on-ramp developers.

 16:17:30 <ev> - Fixing bugs in charms along the way. Pushed one fix to jjo for Cassandra,

 16:17:31 <ev> and filed bug 1099917 for the other.

 16:17:31 <ev> - Fixed bug 1100245 in juju with https://code.launchpad.net/~ev/juju/fix-1100245/+merge/143483

 16:17:32 <ev> - A few bugs to iron out, but we're close. Webops is supposed to be picking

 16:17:32 <ubottu> bug 1099917 in cassandra (Juju Charms Collection) "Cassandra charm changes cluster name incorrectly" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099917

 16:17:33 <ev> this up and throwing it at stagingstack, but they're firefighting.

 16:17:33 <ev> - Code review for Brian. Discussions on the implementation of phased updates.

 16:17:36 <ubottu> bug 1100245 in juju "exceptions.UnboundLocalError: local variable 'settings' referenced before assignment" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100245

 16:18:20 <ogra_> done ?

 16:18:43 <slangasek> he paused for breath

 16:18:58 <ogra_> doesnt sound like breath :)

 16:19:02 <ogra_> more like chatting :P

 16:20:18 <jodh> cjwatson: thanks :) We have fixed the issue in newer releases so I'll cherry-pick the relevant bits and make a .2 release for precise.

 16:20:18 <ev> - Code review for Brian. Discussions on the implementation of phased updates.

 16:20:19 <ev> - Started implementing "silent error types" after discussion with Martin:

 16:20:19 <ev> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#error

 16:20:19 <ev> (DONE)

 16:20:36 <ogra_> done:

 16:20:37 <ogra_> * started fiddling with porting the nx7 images to xz compression

 16:20:37 <ogra_> * looked into porting update-notifier to pkexec (then only xdiagnose will keep gksu on the cd)

 16:20:37 <ogra_> * started on fiddling with tegra3 gstreamer codecs, seems there is half a community port to gst 1.0 already

 16:20:37 <ogra_> todo:

 16:20:38 <ogra_> * discuss livefs builder situation with infinity (carried over from last week)

 16:20:40 <ogra_> * fix plymouth vs console-setup racing somehow (likely needs cjwatson advice) to allow initrd-less booting

 16:20:43 <ogra_> ..

 16:21:38 <slangasek> cool

 16:21:42 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:21:46 <slangasek> bdmurray?

 16:22:15 <bdmurray> bug 1093819 looks interesting

 16:22:17 <ubottu> bug 1093819 in Wubi "Wubi installed 12.10 amd64 without configuring i386" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1093819

 16:23:05 <bdmurray> I have not tested it myself though

 16:23:34 <slangasek> cjwatson: any idea about that one?  where are we running dpkg --add-architecture now?

 16:24:01 <cjwatson> apt-setup

 16:24:04 <cjwatson> generators/01setup

 16:25:02 <cjwatson> controlled by apt-setup/multiarch preseeding, which defaults to "i386" on amd64 and empty on all other arches

 16:25:23 <slangasek> is it possible preseeding isn't working right under wubi?

 16:25:24 <cjwatson> don't see wubi preseeding that

 16:25:27 <xnox> and there is dpkg maint script to add i386.

 16:25:31 <slangasek> ah

 16:25:36 <cjwatson> slangasek: it would have to be actively preseeding it *off*

 16:26:10 <cjwatson> should be easy to look in the preinstalled image and check, I guess

 16:26:31 <cjwatson> oh yes, of course, preinstalled image so it might not run apt-setup

 16:26:40 * cjwatson forgets the exact details of the new setup - ev?

 16:26:57 <cjwatson> even so, dpkg.postinst should take care of it

 16:27:37 <ev> oh hi

 16:27:56 <ev> it's been a while for me too :), but:

 16:28:14 <ev> compressed disk image unpacked, then small initramfs tomfoolery

 16:28:21 <ev> for initial setup

 16:29:44 <cjwatson> how much of ubiquity does it go through, if anyy?

 16:29:45 <cjwatson> *any

 16:29:51 <ev> none

 16:29:58 <cjwatson> ok, so it's purely about the preinstalled image

 16:30:13 <ev> lupin -> scripts/local-bottom/lupin_setup

 16:30:26 * cjwatson peers at cdimage

 16:30:41 <cjwatson> oh great, it's a tar of a root.disk so I can't easily inspect it locally ...

 16:30:50 * ev whistles

 16:31:23 <ev> hey man, I just make the tea around this place. Any name you find in bzr blame that looks similar to mine is purely coincidental.

 16:31:49 <cjwatson> so, er, somebody with vaguely fast networking might like to download/unpack/loop-mount http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ubuntu-12.10-wubi-amd64.tar.xz and see what its dpkg metadata looks like

 16:32:55 <bdmurray> so then an automatic upgrade test is failing in bug 1096022

 16:32:58 <ubottu> bug 1096022 in update-manager (Ubuntu) ""E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks" during lucid->precise universe upgrade of amd64" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1096022

 16:33:10 <slangasek> bdmurray: can you follow up on that download/unpack/loop-mount after the meeting, then?

 16:33:52 <bdmurray> slangasek: yes, downloading now

 16:34:01 <slangasek> cool

 16:34:16 <slangasek> bdmurray: hum, so this is a *new* upgrade failure in the jenkins autotester?

 16:34:38 <bdmurray> slangasek: that's the impression I got

 16:35:05 <slangasek> do we know what date it started happening?  Maybe we can trace it to a particular SRU's publication

 16:35:50 <bdmurray> hrm, actually it looks intermittent

 16:35:58 <bdmurray> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise/view/Upgrade%20Testing%20Dashboard/job/precise-upgrade-lucid-universe/ARCH=amd64,LTS=lts,PROFILE=universe,label=upgrade-test/

 16:36:39 <slangasek> oh, well then :P

 16:36:46 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll look at that in more depth.

 16:37:05 <bdmurray> Who could I talk to about understanding the pkgProblemResolver logs though?

 16:37:30 * slangasek raises his hand

 16:37:41 <bdmurray> great

 16:37:57 <bdmurray> somebody in my timezone even!

 16:38:38 <bdmurray> I ran across bug 1077551 again and it seems worrisome to me

 16:38:41 <ubottu> bug 1077551 in aptdaemon (Ubuntu) "Installing Machinarium removes the desktop" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1077551

 16:39:08 <slangasek> something's strange about that jenkins build, though; why is Dec 27, 2012 the oldest run of the job?

 16:39:34 <slangasek> did we lose history?

 16:39:37 <bdmurray> there was a comment from glatzor regarding 'We already don't allow to remove "essential" packages by using aptdaemon, e.g ubuntu-minimal. Perhaps we should add some more to the list (e.g. unity or even ubuntu-desktop)?'

 16:41:02 <slangasek> I'm not sure that's something that should be a policy in aptdaemon

 16:41:17 <slangasek> update-manager has that kind of policy, and maybe software-center should too

 16:43:35 <bdmurray> so I'll follow up with the software center team then?

 16:45:06 <slangasek> sounds good to me

 16:46:03 <bdmurray> then looking at errors.ubuntu.com this has a high instance count

 16:46:09 <bdmurray> https://errors.ubuntu.com/bucket/?id=%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Flsb_release%3AIOError%3A%3Cmodule%3E%3Amain%3Acheck_modules_installed%3Agetoutput%3Agetstatusoutput

 16:47:02 <ogra_> err, what ?

 16:48:00 * ogra_ gets a weird bluescreen here

 16:48:04 <bdmurray> hmm the instance I looked at has a ProcCmdline of /usr/bin/python -Es /usr/bin/lsb_release -a

 16:48:22 <ogra_> clicking it gets me to http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail118.html

 16:50:02 <ogra_> ev, is that on purpose or some bad joke i dont understand ?

 16:50:10 <slangasek> bdmurray: very strange; why would we start seeing failures from lsb_release in 12.04, 9 months after release?

 16:50:15 <ev> it means there's an error in the code

 16:50:24 <ev> and it's not a bad joke! :)

 16:50:28 <bdmurray> ogra_: it could be a great joke you don't understand.

 16:50:37 <ev> yeah!

 16:50:45 <ogra_> well, i got from the SSO page directly to that bluescreenish page

 16:50:54 <ogra_> pretty scary

 16:51:02 <ogra_> telling me i have a virus

 16:51:03 <cjwatson> in the past I've seen failures from lsb_release which were due to people building derivatives and misconfiguring /etc/lsb-release

 16:51:04 <ev> yup, digging at your error now

 16:51:24 <cjwatson> not sure that fits this case though

 16:51:28 <barry> i just get an sso page loop

 16:51:49 <ogra_> i get that when i try it in a second tab

 16:52:00 <jodh> barry: I did too until I clicked all the checkboxes :)

 16:52:12 <ev> yeah, you need to send your team

 16:52:16 <ev> I have a branch that makes this a bit more clear

 16:52:26 <ev> ogra_: could you try again?

 16:52:33 <ev> just trying to figure out which error is yours

 16:52:53 * barry goes click-n-clack

 16:52:54 <ogra_> ev, works now

 16:53:06 <ev> damn, though it looks like it's unicode fun

 16:53:11 <cjwatson> and ECHILD is just a bizarre thing to happen there

 16:53:55 <cjwatson> that kind of looks like "somebody else reaped my child process before I could"

 16:54:14 <jodh> bdmurray: btw - have you seen bug 1100198?

 16:54:16 <ubottu> bug 1100198 in apport (Ubuntu) "source_linux.py logic fails to detect 3.8.0-0-generic as an Ubuntu kernel" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100198

 16:54:35 <bdmurray> jodh: no, I'll have a look

 16:57:25 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you want to open a bug report for the lsb_release crash, and we can add it to the stack?  It doesn't look urgent

 16:58:11 <bdmurray> slangasek: sounds good

 16:58:28 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:58:30 <bdmurray> there might have an apport sru that changed this

 16:58:36 <slangasek> hmm

 16:59:21 <bdmurray> anyway, that is all

 16:59:27 <slangasek> ok

 16:59:29 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:59:35 <slangasek> anything else else?

 17:00:04 <cjwatson> I was wondering about an idea for the build-dep-substitution problem in cross-builds

 17:00:39 <cjwatson> (e.g. that when you see Build-Depends: gcc-4.6, you probably actually want Build-Depends: gcc-4.6:native, gcc-4.6-$HOST_TRIPLET)

 17:01:26 <cjwatson> What would people (esp. doko, infinity) think about a scheme whereby packages that need this kind of substitution done have some field in their package metadata (Cross-Available: yes or something) to say so?

 17:01:57 <cjwatson> It would beat writing a big list into sbuild and dpkg-checkbuilddeps, having to look at the apt cache in dpkg-checkbuilddeps, or any of the other heuristics I've been able to think of

 17:02:57 <slangasek> cjwatson: maybe we can take that to #ubuntu-devel for follow-up?

 17:03:03 <slangasek> sorry, I'm being pulled into meetings for the client sprint :)

 17:03:31 <cjwatson> Fair enough, or I might just take it to debian-devel since I believe there's an appropriate thread there at the moment

 17:03:36 <slangasek> ok

 17:03:39 <slangasek> #endmeeting
