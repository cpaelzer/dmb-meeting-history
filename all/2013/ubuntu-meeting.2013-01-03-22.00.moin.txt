 22:01:19 <cjohnston> #topic Ubuntu  Membership Review Board - 3 January 2013

 22:01:31 <cjohnston> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 3 January 2013. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:01:47 <cjohnston> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:01:59 <cjohnston> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:02:05 <cjohnston> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:02:11 <cjohnston> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:02:20 <cjohnston> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:02:25 <cjohnston> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:03:16 <cjohnston> I don't see the first applicant in here.. so I will go on to the second

 22:03:24 <cjohnston> Would someone mind checking to see if the first is online please?

 22:03:33 <hggdh> Abdobonna: there?

 22:04:09 <cjohnston> #topic Ahmed​Abou​Zaid 's membership application

 22:04:20 <cjohnston> AhmedAbouZaid: please introduce yourself

 22:04:39 <AhmedAbouZaid> Thanks cjohnston : )

 22:05:00 <AhmedAbouZaid> My name is Ahmed, I'm 23 years old, I live in Cairo.

 22:05:22 <AhmedAbouZaid> fully Ubuntu user since 2008

 22:06:38 <AhmedAbouZaid> I love and believe in Free/Open source  and Ubuntu  :)

 22:06:51 <cjohnston> AhmedAbouZaid: I don't see anything documented on your wiki page for the last year. What happened?

 22:07:23 <cjohnston> #voters iulian

 22:07:23 <meetingology> Current voters: PabloRubianes cjohnston cyphermox hggdh iulian

 22:08:00 <ashams> may I support AhmedAbouZaid ?

 22:08:02 <AhmedAbouZaid> cjohnston: I was to perform compulsory military service in Egypt.

 22:08:29 <AhmedAbouZaid> cjohnston: It's about 12 months.

 22:08:50 <hggdh> ah

 22:09:22 <AhmedAbouZaid> cjohnston: So my activity was very limited this year : )

 22:09:33 <cjohnston> understandable in that case

 22:10:41 <PabloRubianes> AhmedAbouZaid, nice work with the book, are you already working on the updated version?

 22:10:42 <AhmedAbouZaid> My wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AhmedAbouZaid

 22:11:33 <cyphermox> AhmedAbouZaid: I see you mention bugs reporting on your wiki page, but I can't see any on your launchpad page. Do you report your bugs elsewhere?

 22:11:34 <AhmedAbouZaid> PabloRubianes: Yes, I'm working now on a second version of it.

 22:12:13 <iulian> AhmedAbouZaid: How do I download the book?

 22:12:32 <iulian> Or rather, could you please give me the direct link?

 22:13:04 <AhmedAbouZaid> cyphermox: Unfortunately most of the reports were not through launchpad.

 22:13:23 <AhmedAbouZaid> iulian: One moment please.

 22:13:28 <iulian> I think I got it.

 22:13:50 <iulian> You could still paste the link here just for the record.

 22:14:06 <AhmedAbouZaid> Book site: http://www.simplyubuntu.com/

 22:14:08 <AhmedAbouZaid> Download link: http://download.simplyubuntu.com/getit.php

 22:14:10 <cyphermox> AhmedAbouZaid: that's what I thought. Is it due to reporting the bugs in English?

 22:15:58 <hggdh> AhmedAbouZaid: thank you for publishing the book with (at least) an option for free download. I/we appreciate it

 22:16:07 <AhmedAbouZaid> cyphermox: I made bug reports either in English and Arabic.

 22:16:10 <cyphermox> yeah it's really nice :)

 22:16:16 <cyphermox> ok
