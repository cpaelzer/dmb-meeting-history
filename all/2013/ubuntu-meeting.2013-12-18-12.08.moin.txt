 12:08 <jared> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:08 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Dec 18 12:08:07 2013 UTC.  The chair is jared. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 12:08 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for December 18, 2013.

 12:08 <jared> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:08 <jared> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:08 <jared> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:08 <jared> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:08 <jared> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:08 <jared> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:10 <jared> #subtopic RomelSan

 12:10 <jared> #topic RomelSan

 12:10 <jared> RomelSan: can you please introduce yourself to the team while we read over your application

 12:10 <RomelSan> Ok

 12:10 <jared> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Romel%20Vera

 12:10 <RomelSan> Hi, i am Romel Vera from Ecuador (south america)

 12:11 <RomelSan> i work for a PC company that builds computers and sell them to schools, government, home users, small office

 12:11 <RomelSan> I am in charge of building the OEM images, (Windows, Linux images)

 12:12 <RomelSan> We build like 3000 computers per month

 12:12 <RomelSan> I am a father, husband, i play the piano (mid level). I love to test, compare computer OSes

 12:13 <jared> RomelSan: have you contributed to any teams, locos or other projects in the Ubuntu ecosystem?

 12:13 <RomelSan> No, i am not an active linux developer or contributor

 12:14 <RomelSan> I will join the OEM sections in 2014

 12:14 <cyphermox> What has been your involvement in the Ubuntu community so far?

 12:15 <RomelSan> A really support Ubuntu, but in my community

 12:15 <RomelSan> i am the one who is asked about linux usage, education

 12:16 <RomelSan> they sometimes make special request for computers in schools

 12:17 <RomelSan> government too

 12:17 <cyphermox> Have you considered joining the Ubuntu Ecuador team or had any involvement with them yet?

 12:17 <RomelSan> Of course i will.

 12:17 <jared> RomelSan: to me the thing is, you look liek you're seeking membership to apply to other Ubuntu teams, Ubuntu Membership is actually about recognition of significant and sustained contributes to Ubuntu and/or the community.

 12:18 <jared> RomelSan: does that make sense and is that how you see it?

 12:19 <RomelSan> i well, it is not to the virtual community

 12:19 <RomelSan> To the ubuntu distribution and general linux. Then yes.

 12:20 <RomelSan> This year in my country i shipped 36000+ PCs with Ubuntu

 12:20 <jared> RomelSan: I agree you probably contribute significantly to the general linux community in your area. I also think you would be very valuable in the OEM team for Ubuntu. However as far as membership goes I think I would like to see some active participation in a loco or other team 9such as the OEM) to meet the significant and sustained requirements for membership.

 12:21 <RomelSan> of course you will.

 12:23 <Pendulum> RomelSan: what jared is trying to say is that we need to see that contribution *before* you apply for membership. Ubuntu Membership isn't a gateway to joining teams. You just join those and contribute to them

 12:24 <RomelSan> oh, i see.

 12:24 <cyphermox> RomelSan: since the purpose of Ubuntu Membership is to "reward" significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu specifically, with not much more than an email address, we'd like to invite you to join the team and come back in a few months when you've had more involvement in the Ubuntu community, with other people in the Ubuntu Ecuador team, etc. who can vouch for you

 12:25 <cyphermox> your current implication is great, just maybe a little too general to Linux

 12:26 <jared> RomelSan: what we think will help the best is if we hold off on your application for now and give you some contact details to start helping out with the OEM stuff you were referring to. Then after contributions we'd love to see you back. Does that sound fair?

 12:27 <RomelSan> sure, thanks.

 12:27 <cyphermox> RomelSan: if ping me later, I will try to get you contacts for someone in OEM at Canonical, if that's what you meant about joining OEM sections

 12:28 <jared> RomelSan: not a problem, we'll continue with the other applications and if you ping cyphermox afterwards he can put you in contact with the relevant people

 12:28 <RomelSan> thanks all, will do.

 12:34 <cyphermox> awesome!

 12:38 <cyphermox> congrats!

 12:38 <jared> Sorry to keep it so brief but I'll now move on to the next applicant, I'd like to do our best to get through all the applications in the hour.

 12:39 <cyphermox> marcus: make sure you add your blog to planet Ubuntu if you have one, it would be nice to see more from you

 12:39 <jared> Is stratus_ss here?

 12:39 <Sebastien> Congrats marcus :)

 12:40 <jared> Ok, I'll move on to Sebastien and come back to stratus_ss if they show up

 12:40 <jared> #topic Sebastien

 12:40 <Sebastien> Hello :)

 12:41 <jared> Hello Sebastien, can you please introduce yourself while we review your applciation

 12:41 <Sebastien> Sure :)  My name is Sebastien Lemery, i am 29 years old and i live in Gatineau, Qc.

 12:42 <Sebastien> I have been working in the "tech" industry since a few years now. I am a tesk cupport rep for a local ISP here. I always have got an attraction for electronics, and this is how i fell in love with ubuntu.

 12:43 <Sebastien> I have tried various linux distros, but my favorite one of all time will stay Ubuntu.

 12:44 <Pendulum> Sebastien: why would you like to be an Ubuntu Member?

 12:44 <Sebastien> I have been hanging out on #ubuntu, #ubuntu-ca, #ubuntu-qc, #freenode and other various channels on the network for a few years now, helping the people of the community the best i can, and always loved it.

 12:45 <Sebastien> I would love to become a member, to be able to implicate myself a little more, and to represent the community a little more officially.

 12:46 <Sebastien> I think its my "next step" before setting up a ubuntu hour in my area.

 12:46 <jared> Sebastien: you don't feel you can do a Ubuntu Hour without membership?

 12:46 <Pendulum> Why not just setup the Ubuntu Hour?

 12:47 <Sebastien> Yes i can. Nothing is stopping me, and we have been speaking about it in #ubuntu-ca.

 12:48 <Sebastien> as a member of ubuntu-qc and my attempts to try to join the french translator team, the ubuntu hour is not the only thing on my list :)

 12:48 <jared> Sebastien: great, it sounds like you want to start contributing but we need to see previous contributions rather than membership being required to participate

 12:48 <cyphermox> Sebastien: you haven't been approved in fr-ca-translators?

 12:49 <Sebastien> cyphermox, not yet.

 12:49 <cyphermox> Sebastien: I'll fix that

 12:49 <cyphermox> so, as jared was mentioning

 12:49 <Sebastien> jared, my contribution right now has been mostly done online here on freenode.

 12:49 <Sebastien> cyphermox, perfect :)

 12:50 <jared> Sebastien: by the way, cyphermox is one of the team leads for the QC team so it's good you're both here :)

 12:50 <Sebastien> Indeed it is :)

 12:50 <cyphermox> Ubuntu Membership is meant to be a recognition of sustained and significant contribution to Ubuntu and the community. It's not easy for us at the moment to see what your contributions have been, and it seems like it would be best if you could come back at a later time, perhaps with testimonials from people (I'll be happy to leave one)

 12:51 <cyphermox> IdleOne: around?

 12:51 <cyphermox> Sebastien: IdleOne is often in #ubuntu, so he could maybe vouch for you, but it's very early for him too :)

 12:51 <Sebastien> I might not have done much on paper, but in practice, i have been giving the best i can for the community, and i would really want to have a shot at it.

 12:52 <Sebastien> Awesome :)

 12:53 <cyphermox> so, I think the first thing would be to start your Ubuntu Hour, and we'll see if I can convince at least another friend to join in and drive up to Gatineau

 12:53 <Sebastien> Oh and by sustained, i have been online every day, since about 2 years.

 12:53 <jared> Sebastien: I think if you have a chat to cyphermox and the QC team and contribute some of the thing syou've mentioned you would have a great application in about 6 months or so.

 12:53 <Sebastien> :(

 12:55 <jared> I don't think it's a sad thing at all, I think it's good that you're keen to get involved. We're also lucky to have some people here that can help guide and coach you through the next steps

 12:55 <Sebastien> Sure. will do.

 12:56 <cyphermox> Sebastien: you shouldn't let that stop you, let's start organizing some things and you can be back here (perhaps at a later meeting) in no time

 12:56 <jared> Sebastien: do you understand what we're looking for when determining memership though? I don't want to discourage you, more just empower you to do what you were contemplating

 12:57 <Sebastien> Yes, i tought that maybe the help i gave online in #ubuntu and all the affiliate channels would have been something you would take in consideration.

 12:57 <jared> Sebastien: normally if that is the case you would have some supporting testimonials to show your efforts.

 12:58 <jared> While I'm not doubting you have contributed, unless we have some way of seeing and measuring (with the help of others) it's hard for us.

 12:58 <Sebastien> I do not ask anyone to do anything for me :) Usually my testimonials are done face to face when i "fixed" a computer :)

 12:59 <jared> Sebastien: ah see, testimonials usually come from other Ubuntu contributors, such as other IRC Channel helpers, etc

 12:59 <cyphermox> Sebastien: that's why I tried to ping someone, because anyone else on the channels could perhaps have chimed in to say you're a nice guy ;)

 12:59 <Sebastien> I am more focused on the online community then anything else, i Love IRC,a nd the ubuntu community. Another one of my goal would be to join the ubuntu-irc group. This is something that i would really like to do.

 13:00 <Sebastien> Heh, i get that cyphermox. maybe if you ping #freenode completely, a few 100s people could reply.

 13:00 <Sebastien> i have been around irc for more then a decade :)

 13:03 <jared> Sebastien: ok so while we appreciate you have contributed the consensus is that we're unable to gauge the significant and sustained requirements for Ubuntu Membership at this time.

 13:03 <jared> Sebastien: however don't fret, it could just mean we need more information

 13:04 <jared> What I'm proposing to do is to hold off on the applciation for now and spend a few minutes with you after the meeting explaining some ways to make it easier to show.

 13:04 <jared> Would you be okay with that?

 13:04 <Sebastien> If its not too late for you, i don't mind.

 13:04 <Sebastien> i have time.

 13:08 <Sebastien> Well thank you jared, and to everyone in the board, i appreciate your time. I will see you around!

 13:08 <jared> #action Sebastien to be given information on how to make the application show requirements met and to return when able to show significant and sustained contributions

 13:08 * meetingology Sebastien to be given information on how to make the application show requirements met and to return when able to show significant and sustained contributions
