 12:24:21 <Pendulum> #topic smartboyhw's application for membership

 12:24:27 <jrgifford> YAY smartboyhw!

 12:24:30 <Pendulum> smartboyhw: please introduce yourself :)

 12:24:30 <smartboyhw> Hello all.

 12:24:37 <smartboyhw> I'm smartboyhw, Real name Howard Chan

 12:24:43 <smartboyhw> I'm 14 from Hong Kong, China

 12:24:50 <smartboyhw> Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw

 12:24:59 <smartboyhw> Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw

 12:25:07 <smartboyhw> I work at different fields for Ubuntu

 12:25:22 <smartboyhw> namely QA and packaging

 12:25:39 <smartboyhw> In Ubuntu Community QA Team I mostly do ISO testing (I am a lover for it)

 12:26:09 <smartboyhw> I am also a Ubuntu Testcase Admin so I also do writing testcases (I did one for Ubuntu Studio, I am currently doing one for transmission)

 12:26:18 <smartboyhw> I also help QA in Kubuntu and Ubuntu Studio

 12:26:34 <smartboyhw> I am the major QA person in Ubuntu Studio.... Also I help to write some testing docs

 12:26:50 <smartboyhw> I also help some development projects

 12:26:57 <smartboyhw> Ubuntu Accomplishments is one

 12:27:07 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: what things have you packaged/ bugs have you worked on/ merges, etc.?

 12:27:18 <smartboyhw> cyphermox, for the package list refer to my wiki:P

 12:27:43 <smartboyhw> Namely (currently) calligra, rekonq, rt-tests and libktorrent

 12:28:06 <smartboyhw> These are mostly Kubuntu packages since I am now an elite packager for Kubuntu

 12:28:43 <smartboyhw> So that's it I think

 12:28:53 <smartboyhw> Been contributing to Ubuntu for 8 months

 12:29:10 <smartboyhw> ..

 12:29:45 <zequence-s> Hi, I'm a Ubuntu Studio developer, and have found smartboyhw's contributions quite valuable, specifically in the QA area, where he's showing very good organizational skills

 12:30:20 <Riddell> I fully recommend smartboyhw as an ubuntu member, he's been keen and enthusiastic to help kubuntu for the last few weeks and is now a kubuntu ninja

 12:30:22 <smartboyhw> Thanks zequence-s ;D

 12:30:26 <smartboyhw> Thanks Riddell too

 12:31:29 <jrgifford> I'm a Ask Ubuntu community moderator, and while he didn't mention it, he is one of our active users.

 12:31:54 <jrgifford> and I highly recommend him for ubuntu membership.

 12:31:58 <smartboyhw> Thanks jrgifford :)

 12:33:02 * apachelogger recommends elite kubuntu ninja

 12:33:10 <smartboyhw> Thanks apachelogger

 12:34:05 <smartboyhw> ..

 12:35:32 <Tm_T> I recommend smartboyhw also, have seen him being rather active on Kubuntu side (:

 12:35:46 <smartboyhw> Thanks Tm_T

 12:40:21 <apachelogger> gz

 12:40:54 <Pendulum> dosaboy: you're Edward Hope-Morley, correct?

 12:41:01 <dosaboy> yes

 12:41:11 <Pendulum> (just double checking since it isn't the IRC nick you put on the application page)

 12:41:21 <Pendulum> okay, dosaboy, you're up

 12:41:30 <Pendulum> #topic dosaboy for Ubuntu Membership

 12:41:38 * dosaboy definitely does not have as impressive a resume as smartboyhw

 12:41:42 <Pendulum> dosaboy: please introduce yourself

 12:41:45 <dosaboy> ok so I am Ed Hope-Morley

 12:41:46 <smartboyhw> dosaboy, no worries:)

 12:41:47 <jpds> dosaboy++

 12:41:51 <dosaboy> based in the UK

 12:42:16 <dosaboy> I've been using ubuntu for many years and I have been working on the Openstack project for the last 2 1/2 years

 12:42:23 <dosaboy> ubuntu-based

 12:42:44 <dosaboy> I have recently joined a team that maintains ubunut packages for openstack

 12:42:53 <dosaboy> and I am now contributing

 12:43:27 <dosaboy> I will be working on LTS and upstream support

 12:43:46 <ivoks> dosaboy's work till how has been mostly testing (QA) of openstack on ubuntu, but all the work he does eventually ends up in ubuntu, so ++ from me, if that counts for anything

 12:44:00 <dosaboy> and that's kind of all I can say atm

 12:44:08 <zul> ++ from me as well

 12:44:17 <dosaboy> thanks ivoks, zul

 12:44:30 <dosaboy> oh and my wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdwardHope-Morley

 12:49:05 <Pendulum> dosaboy: why are you interested in becoming a member?

 12:50:48 <dosaboy> if the opportunity arises for decisions to be taken on Openstack strategy it would be nice to have a say and contribute if I can and as I understand it being a member of the project would help this.

 12:51:33 <cjohnston> dosaboy: I believe openstack has their own memership of sorts

 12:52:14 <cjohnston> dosaboy: http://www.openstack.org/foundation/ I think your referring to foundation membership

 12:52:45 <dosaboy> agreed but openstack's ineterests may not always be alleiged with ubuntu

 12:52:58 <dosaboy> whereas mine are :)

 12:53:21 <Pendulum> dosaboy: how long have you been contributing to Ubuntu?

 12:53:36 <zul> cjohnston: ubuntu memebership and openstack foundation are two different things

 12:54:03 <dosaboy> I only starting contributing to ubuntu last month, as I have only just joined the team

 12:54:37 <cjohnston> zul: if the opportunity arises for decisions to be taken on Openstack strategy it would be nice to have a say and contribute if I can and as I understand it being a member of the project would help this." -- It seems to me that dosaboy believes that Ubuntu Membership would help him with something

 12:55:01 <ivoks> openstack strategy within ubuntu

 12:55:15 <cjohnston> Ubuntu Membership still has nothing to do with that.

 12:55:19 <micahg> dosaboy: have you read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership ?

 12:55:53 <dosaboy> um, yes

 12:56:13 <cjohnston> Ubuntu Membership is awarded (or given) in recognition of sustained contributions to Ubuntu. I have never been asked as an Ubuntu Member to vote on something related to Openstack.

 12:56:43 <ivoks> his contribution in ubuntu is in realm of openstack... he's a server engineer

 12:56:50 <micahg> dosaboy: so, you feel that you've already significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu and the Ubuntu community?

 12:56:54 <cjohnston> ivoks: I understnad that.

 12:57:00 <ivoks> for istance, an SRU he filled few days ago

 12:57:20 <cjohnston> ivoks: I understand that as well.i

 12:57:21 <Pendulum> Generally we see "sustained" as 6 months or more of contributions

 12:57:50 <dosaboy> micahg: I openly admit I do/have not got the contribution history but I am ffor that forthwith. If you would prefer that I retrun once I have said contribution history that is fine by me.

 12:58:04 <micahg> ivoks: SRU is development work which this board only treats as tangential to the application, if packaging work is the primary source of contribution, then an application to the DMB is more appropriate

 12:59:12 <Pendulum> dosaboy: Ubuntu membership is based on having already contributed and showing that it's been sustained over time. You do not need it to contribute to any facet of the project. Please come back when you've spent more time contributing. :)

 12:59:26 <dosaboy> I was under the impression that maintaining and testing packages for ubuntu would qualify me for membership :)

 12:59:33 <dosaboy> ok sure

 12:59:57 <cjohnston> dosaboy: it would. After it has 1) been sustained, and 2) for that you should probably apply to the DMB

 13:00:06 <dosaboy> ack

 13:00:25 <micahg> well, if it's mainly QA, I'd say here, if it's mainly packaging, the DMB

 13:00:35 <cjohnston> what micahg said

 13:01:07 <dosaboy> well it is definitely more QA than packaging

 13:01:50 <dosaboy> e.g. testing upstream patches and backporting

 13:02:12 <Pendulum> just so we can fit the last person in

 13:02:23 <Pendulum> danialbehzadi: are you here?

 13:02:36 <danialbehzadi> Pendulum: yes

 13:02:53 <Pendulum> #topic danialbehzadi for Ubuntu membership

 13:02:59 <Pendulum> danialbehzadi: please introduce yourself :)

 13:03:03 <danialbehzadi> Hi

 13:03:09 <danialbehzadi> I am Danial Behzadi, 23 from Iran

 13:03:15 <danialbehzadi> A computer software engineer and a member of Ubuntu-ir loco team, forum oderator, and web team

 13:03:21 <danialbehzadi> My launchpad link: https://launchpad.net/~dani.behzi

 13:03:28 <danialbehzadi> My Wiki link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/danialbehzadi

 13:03:35 <danialbehzadi> My first experience in GNU/Linux was in 2003 by a debian-based distro name "Linspire"

 13:03:44 <danialbehzadi> But my complete migration to free software was in 2007 by Ubuntu 7.10 gutsy

 13:03:57 <danialbehzadi> Trough these year I am a member of Ubuntu-ir community and Free Software Users Group of Iran and we tried so hard to make people of all kinds, familiar with software freedoom consept.

 13:04:07 <danialbehzadi> So we made a lot of meetings, celebrations, seminars, free educational classes, and even TV-shows to reach that goal.

 13:04:20 <danialbehzadi> Then I thought about the reasons which reduces GNU/Linux grow speed in my country, and I belive the language problem is the prime reson.

 13:04:30 <danialbehzadi> So, I joined to the translation and localization groups of Ubuntu (in launchpad) and Gnome (in gnome.org) and started to make free software localize for Iran.

 13:04:39 <danialbehzadi> You can See the results in https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+lang/fa and http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/fa/gnome-3-6/ui/

 13:04:49 <danialbehzadi> and compare them to previous two years, before I manage to translate them.

 13:04:57 <danialbehzadi> And I am also the forum moderator of Ubuntu-ir as mentioned before (http://forum.ubuntu.ir/index.php?action=profile;u=3026).

 13:05:03 <danialbehzadi> We manage the community in Iran and comparing to other local teams in various locations, I think that is one the most active local team of Ubuntu.

 13:08:34 <Pendulum> danialbehzadi: is there anyone around who could cheer for you? We like to see support by way of testimonials and/or cheering during the meeting.

 13:09:28 <danialbehzadi> I'm not sure, maybe dholbach? We met twice in Isfahan, Iran and Berlin, Germany.

 13:10:03 <smartboyhw> danialbehzadi, that's interesting

 13:10:19 <dholbach> yes, I met danialbehzadi and could see in Esfahan how much he is involved in the LoCo there

 13:10:53 <dholbach> it was during Software Freedom Day where we met and thanks to him (and others) I also could give a talk there :)

 13:11:01 <micahg> danialbehzadi: are there any Persian translation admins that can vouch for the quality of your translations?

 13:12:03 <danialbehzadi> I am myself a Persian transltion admin in launchpad (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-fa)

 13:12:22 <micahg> danialbehzadi: you're a member, not an admin

 13:12:26 <danialbehzadi> But there is no translator present here now

 13:12:27 <micahg> AFAICT

 13:13:19 <danialbehzadi> Ok. I thought this is for tranlator members (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-fa-contributors)

 13:13:51 <micahg> ah, is that the hierarchy of translations teams

 13:14:25 <danialbehzadi> yes

 13:15:17 <dholbach> https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/155490_1714044137190_4364071_n.jpg was the best picture I could find - Danial is right in front of me :)

 13:15:18 <micahg> danialbehzadi: sorry, translations is one area that I'm not so familiar with

 13:18:40 <dholbach> since we met in Esfahan we got a bit out of touch, but I could see on Facebook and and Google+ that he still was very much involved in Ubuntu Iran - and that's been constantly in the last two years

 13:18:50 <dholbach> I hope that helps... I need to go outside now, sorry

 13:25:36 <Pendulum> Okay, time for us to vote
