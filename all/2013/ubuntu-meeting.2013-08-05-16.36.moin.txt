 16:36 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1186780 in vlc (Ubuntu Raring) "Please update VLC (for security issues)" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1186780

 16:37 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:37 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:37 <jdstrand> I'm on community this week

 16:37 <jdstrand> I have some embargoed updates

 16:38 <jdstrand> patch piloting for august

 16:38 <jdstrand> and various audits

 16:38 <jdstrand> tyhicks: you're up

 16:39 <tyhicks> I'll have a little sync up with jj, when he returns, and then I'll upload apparmor and dbus with DBus mediation support

 16:39 <tyhicks> there's one known bug in dbus mediation and eavesdropping

 16:39 <tyhicks> I'll fix that this week

 16:39 <tyhicks> (but it isn't a blocker for uploading)

 16:40 <tyhicks> I'll focus on my content hub work items this week

 16:40 <tyhicks> I think that's it

 16:40 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week, so it'll be more MIR audits and apparmor patch reviews (thanks tyhicks :)

 16:41 <tyhicks> Oh yeah, I think there's a couple remaining (small) patches that need to be forwarded to the list

 16:41 <tyhicks> I'll dig those out

 16:42 <sarnold> I'm also likely to spend more time on the dnsmasq-resolvconf-confetti bomb, that hting makes such a mess over all my VMs.

 16:43 <sarnold> currently, hard-coded IPs in /etc/hosts are mostly serving, but after the -27 kernel ate some of my VM images, I had to bring up some of the VMs again multiple times to get different IPs for them. what a pain.

 16:43 <jdstrand> sarnold: I think some of that may be a one time sorta thing

 16:43 <sarnold> jdstrand: yeah, I'm hopeful to keep it that way. :)

 16:44 <sarnold> I think that's me, chrisccoulson, your turn :)

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> hi

 16:44 <jdstrand> sarnold: eg, maybe just start over-- clean our /etc/hosts of the static ones, then start each vm, one at a time, and ssh-keygen -R as needed until at the end you have all of them with new ip addresses

 16:44 <jdstrand> sarnold: we can talk more elasewhere if you want

 16:44 <jdstrand> s/elasewhere/elsewhere/

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> so, this week is going to be a fun week. it's firefox and thunderbird release day tomorrow, so i'm currently working on that

 16:44 <sarnold> \o/

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> i've also been working on adding greasemonkey style user script support to oxide, which i plan to use for the unit tests (and which will probably form the basis of webapps)

 16:45 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: was there anything for them coming out of blackhat/defcon?

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, not that i'm aware of

 16:45 <jdstrand> good for them :)

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> i shall get chromium out this week as well

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> and i've got a meeting about the UA string for the mobile browser

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 16:47 <sarnold> jdstrand: the only thing I saw come out of blackhat for the browsers was "hey javascript lets you do a lot of amazing things, and advertising networks make it easy to rent time in a few million browsers..."

 16:48 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: there may be some more oxide discussions too-- I plan on poking at the thread

 16:48 <jdstrand> sarnold: neat. I look forward to hearing from mdeslaur and sbeattie when they get back :)

 16:48 <sarnold> jdstrand: me too :)
