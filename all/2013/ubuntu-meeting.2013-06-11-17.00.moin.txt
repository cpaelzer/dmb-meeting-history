 17:01 <jsalisbury_> [TOPIC] ARM Status (ppisati)

 17:01 <ppisati> Q/master: lp1176977 ("XFS instability on armhf under load") - turned out some

 17:01 <ppisati> xfs tests failure that i was experiencing were already present in 3.5.y

 17:01 <ppisati> vanilla for arm, so none of the backported patches were responsible for it.

 17:01 <ppisati> On the other hand, there's a new 100% reproducible hang while running

 17:01 <ppisati> tests/generic/0368. Still working on it, collecting patches, pinging upstream,

 17:01 <ppisati> etcetc.

 17:01 <ppisati> */highbank: lp1182637("cpu_offlining fails to run on ARM") - according to

 17:01 <ppisati> robherr this is due to a different u-boot that we are using, waiting for an

 17:01 <ppisati> update.

 17:02 <ppisati> S/master: did some testing of 3.10-rcX for omap[34], imx6 and vexpress, so

 17:02 <ppisati> far so good.

 17:02 <ppisati> ..

 17:03 <jsalisbury_> [TOPIC] Status: Saucy Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:03 <ogasawara> Our Saucy unstable branch has been rebased to the latest v3.10-rc5

 17:03 <ogasawara> upstream kernel.  We are still holding off on a v3.10 based upload due

 17:03 <ogasawara> to missing AUFS support as well as some DKMS package failures we would

 17:03 <ogasawara> like to resolve.  We have however gone ahead and rebased our Saucy master

 17:03 <ogasawara> branch to the recent v3.9.5 upstream stable and plan to upload that

 17:03 <ogasawara> today.

 17:03 <ogasawara> On the mobile front I'm hearing news that the container flip should

 17:03 <ogasawara> hopefully be happening this week.

 17:03 <ogasawara> Important upcoming dates:

 17:03 <ogasawara> Thurs June 20 - Alpha 1 (opt in)

 17:03 <ogasawara> ..

 17:04 <jsalisbury_> [TOPIC] Status: CVE's (sconklin)

 17:04 <sconklin> == 2013-06-11 (7 days) ==

 17:04 <sconklin> Currently we have 68 CVEs on our radar, with 9 CVEs added and 0 CVEs retired in the last week.

 17:04 <sconklin> See the CVE matrix for the current list:
