 16:02:38 <hallyn_> spamaps is not around

 16:02:45 <hallyn_> oh ok :)

 16:03:27 <Daviey> m_3: You didn't do the minutes :(

 16:03:59 <hallyn_> didn't arosales run it last week?

 16:04:05 <arosales> I don't think jimbaker or Ursinha are available this week.

 16:04:13 <arosales> hallyn_: m_3 was last week

 16:04:23 <hallyn_> order on wiki page seems weird then

 16:04:32 <arosales> hallyn_: I chaired on 2013-03-19

 16:04:33 <hallyn_> oh, bc m_3 didn't udpate it :)

 16:04:49 <Daviey> I am trying to quickly scan it now

 16:04:50 <hallyn_> sorry, carry on

 16:05:15 <arosales> rbasak: are you available to chair this week?

 16:06:05 <arosales> hmm . . . going down the list I think jamespage is out so next would be zul

 16:06:07 <Daviey> Okay, seems to be contentless :)

 16:06:17 <zul> uh?

 16:06:21 <Daviey> arosales: I suspect I am on the hook.

 16:06:33 <arosales> ah, ok

 16:06:38 <zul> i think i agree with daviey ;)

 16:06:42 <arosales> :-)

 16:06:49 <rbasak> arosales: it looks like Daviey is chairing?

 16:07:56 <Daviey> could someone else take bug 1157918 ?

 16:07:58 <ubottu> bug 1157918 in horizon (Ubuntu Raring) "Network selection tab when starting instance renders incorrectly" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1157918

 16:08:15 <Daviey> adam_g is back this week., so might make sense

 16:08:26 <Daviey> adam_g to follow up from back scroll

 16:08:49 <Daviey> roaksoax: bug 1064527

 16:08:51 <ubottu> bug 1064527 in maas (Ubuntu Raring) "detect_ipmi needs improvement. detects non-existant device in nested kvm" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1064527

 16:08:57 <Daviey> roaksoax: Do you understand the use case for this?

 16:09:38 <roaksoax> Daviey: yes! I haven't gotten to an effective solution but disable auto probing seems to fix it

 16:10:01 <roaksoax> Daviey: i don't yet know the implecations of disabling it since it would be disabling in-band checking

 16:10:03 <Daviey> super

 16:10:29 <Daviey> roaksoax: isn't there some fingerprint it's Qemu?

 16:10:55 <Daviey> hallyn_: ^ ?>

 16:11:39 <Daviey> hallyn_: What fingerprint is best exposed to the guest that it is a Qemu instance ?

 16:11:58 <zul> Daviey:  its in the dmidecode isnt it?

 16:12:22 <hallyn_> cpuinfo?

 16:12:55 <Daviey> roaksoax / hallyn_: can you work together to find something that allows you to make ipmi detection conditional ? :)

 16:13:06 <Daviey> roaksoax: bug 1073463 ?

 16:13:07 <ubottu> bug 1073463 in maas (Ubuntu Raring) "User-configurable files are not installed in /etc" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1073463

 16:14:40 <roaksoax> Daviey: looking at it now

 16:14:44 <Daviey> super

 16:14:53 <Daviey> So........... who wants to volunteer for bug 1162139

 16:14:54 <ubottu> bug 1162139 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Raring) "mysql-5.5 still built using GCC-4.4, should be built with the default GCC" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1162139

 16:15:12 <Daviey> Looks like a low hanging, high reward tasty fruit

 16:15:55 <Daviey> hello doko

 16:16:12 * Daviey prepares to spin the bottle.

 16:16:30 <doko> ?

 16:16:40 <Daviey> rbasak, i fear the bottle landed on you.

 16:16:49 <rbasak> Hmm, OK.

 16:17:03 <rbasak> I am doing +1 maintenance this month so it might fall into that anyway.

 16:17:10 <Daviey> that was my thinking :)

 16:17:42 <rbasak> That's a clever bottle you have there :-)

 16:17:50 <Daviey> zul: bug 1066845 ?

 16:17:51 <ubottu> bug 1066845 in nova (Ubuntu Quantal) "nova-novncproxy is not running; Suggest: novnc should be Depends" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1066845

 16:18:06 <zul> Daviey:  uploaded like this morning

 16:18:22 <Daviey> so it is!

 16:18:41 <Daviey> bug 1121874 .. hmmmm

 16:18:42 <ubottu> bug 1121874 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Raring) "MySQL launch fails silently if < 4MB of disk space is available" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1121874

 16:19:23 <doko> while you are at mysql-5.5 ... it's still built using gcc-4.4 :-(

 16:19:37 <Daviey> doko: If you were here earlier.... that would have been good timing

 16:19:53 <Daviey> rbasak: Does it make sense to try and do someting with that, whilst tackling 1162139?

 16:20:24 <rbasak> Daviey: ack

 16:20:26 <doko> maybe configure using openssl?

 16:21:20 <Daviey> TOPIC Blueprints

 16:21:33 <Daviey> #LINK http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html

 16:22:01 <Daviey> lets look at the Reds

 16:22:03 <Daviey> smoser: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-image-access

 16:22:07 <Daviey> can you comment on it?

 16:22:24 <smoser> we're in much better position now.

 16:22:28 <Daviey> outstanding is, collect complete list Ubuntu server bits to be supported: TODO

 16:22:33 <smoser> simplestreams client has been uploaded to cloud-init

 16:22:43 <smoser> i think we have the list

 16:22:47 <smoser> but we don thave data for everything

 16:23:03 <smoser> still to get data produced for maas and for installer files

 16:23:24 <Daviey> right.. Doesn't sound concerning.. progress looks good.. thanks smoser

 16:23:25 <utlemming> smoser: I'm going to be working on MAAS this week to get that data

 16:23:27 <Daviey> Next.

 16:23:33 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow

 16:23:45 <Daviey> .. I will comment in lieu of jamespage

 16:23:51 <smoser> utlemming, oh, good.

 16:23:56 <Daviey> It's mostly dep-8 stuff making it look so poor.

 16:24:19 <Daviey> I think we will have to defer some of them, but we should probably all try and nab a test.. It's good to learn how dep-8 works

 16:24:26 <Daviey> So,

 16:24:44 <Daviey> #ACTION ALL, please look to hijack a dep-8 test from https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow

 16:24:44 * meetingology ALL, please look to hijack a dep-8 test from https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow

 16:24:55 <Daviey> Cookies for those that do this.

 16:25:12 <Daviey> NEXT

 16:25:15 <Daviey> #TOPIC https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-cloudarchive

 16:25:38 <Daviey> canary testing of cloud-archive pockets with 12.04 on a daily basis: TODO

 16:25:48 <Daviey> .. Probably needs Jamesage or adam_g to comment

 16:26:00 <Daviey> same with, bug reporting apport stuff for cloud-archive to ensure bugs get to the right location: TODO

 16:26:23 <Daviey> And Doc's and Communications.  We should get to this

 16:26:29 <Daviey> but generally, it seems we are looking OK

 16:26:31 <Daviey> NEXT

 16:26:55 <Daviey> #TOPIC https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-mysql

 16:27:11 <Daviey> Nobody has been able to pick this up from Spamaps yet

 16:27:33 <arosales> Daviey: ya I need to follow up with Norvald on this

 16:27:43 <Daviey> arosales: Are you happy to do that?

 16:27:58 <arosales> yup, I will follow up with norvald

 16:28:08 <Daviey> reducing the delta should be postponed for this cycle IMO

 16:28:26 <Daviey> but packaging percona for Ubuntu still seems a good idea IMO

 16:28:37 <Daviey> Depending on complexity

 16:28:55 <Daviey> #ACTION arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:28:55 * meetingology arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:29:11 <arosales> Daviey: ack, on the postpone

 16:30:52 <Daviey> smoser: can you comment ?

 16:31:29 <Daviey> smoser: mostly tieing juju into simplestreams data, right?

 16:31:31 <smoser> we're making progress there. that work is in simpelstreams client.

 16:31:40 <smoser> a glance mirror is in trunk right now.

 16:31:50 <smoser> and it needs to be taught how to write to swift.

 16:31:54 <smoser> but then we'll be really close.

 16:32:31 <Daviey> smoser: is py-juju or juju-core the intended target?

 16:32:40 <Daviey> And is it still on target for Raring?

 16:32:47 <smoser> juju-core.

 16:33:13 <smoser> its on the juju todo lists, but i think of not significant priority compared to other things

 16:33:46 <Daviey> smoser: Can you reach out to juju-core and discuss what we can achieve for Raring?

 16:34:10 <smoser> yeah. i will
