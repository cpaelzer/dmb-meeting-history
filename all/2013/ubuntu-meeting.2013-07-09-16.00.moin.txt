 16:00 <yolanda> arosales to carry out post-meeting procedure (minutes, etc) documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase for meeting of 25 June

 16:01 <yolanda> any update?

 16:01 <jamespage> o/

 16:02 <roaksoax> o/

 16:02 <yolanda> Daviey to speak to Percona about Saucy inclusion

 16:03 <Daviey> yolanda: 25 June still not done.  I'll work with arosales after this

 16:03 <Daviey> yolanda: I haven't spoken to percona this week.  Will do THIS week

 16:04 <yolanda> ok, let's leave as pending then

 16:04 <yolanda> any other pending topics?

 16:04 <Daviey> Nope

 16:04 <yolanda> #topic Saucy Development

 16:04 <yolanda> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule

 16:05 <yolanda> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:05 <yolanda> Daviey, any update with that?

 16:05 <arosales> sorry, joined a little late

 16:05 <arosales> here now

 16:05 <Daviey> First.. the Release Schedule

 16:05 <Daviey> DebianImportFreeze / Alpha2ish

 16:05 <Daviey> Would be good to be up to date on sync's and merges for then.

 16:06 <Daviey> rbasak has graciously fixed my delta report

 16:06 <arosales> yolanda, I think rbasak put in a new process that he is carrying forward. I will ensure the wiki has the minutes from my chair'ing for historical reasons

 16:06 <Daviey> http://people.canonical.com/~rbasak/delta.html

 16:06 <rbasak> Note: I haven't cronned that. I generated it earlier.

 16:06 <Daviey> We should try over this next week to reduce our delta with Debian

 16:07 <yolanda> rbasak, are you doing something automatic?

 16:07 <Daviey> #ACTION rbasak to land delta report to lp:ubuntu-reports, Daviey to deploy

 16:07 * meetingology rbasak to land delta report to lp:ubuntu-reports, Daviey to deploy

 16:07 <rbasak> yolanda: I intend to, but I haven't done it yet.

 16:07 <rbasak> ack

 16:08 <yolanda> i could help a bit with merges and syncs this week also

 16:08 <jamespage> Daviey, +1 to that

 16:09 <Daviey> Shall we look at, http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-s-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:09 <Daviey> bug 1124384

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1124384 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Saucy) "Configuration reload clears event that others jobs may be waiting on" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1124384

 16:09 <Daviey> smoser: Are we expecting a cloud-init upload soon?

 16:09 <smoser> yes.

 16:09 <Daviey> I noticed that Debian is carrying a delta

 16:10 <smoser> that one is fixed in raring ..

 16:10 <smoser> oh?

 16:10 <Daviey> smoser: http://ftp-master.metadata.debian.org/changelogs//main/c/cloud-init/cloud-init_0.7.2-1_changelog

 16:11 <Daviey> Might be worth checking if we can fold anything interesting

 16:11 <Daviey> bug 1196921

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1196921 in vim (Ubuntu Saucy) "updating packages to lua5.2 in main" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1196921

 16:11 <smoser> yeah. thanks.

 16:12 <Daviey> rbasak: You had thoguths on transitions such as this.  Is it worth just uploading a new rrdtool and see what breaks?

 16:12 <Daviey> (i feel evil suggesting that)

 16:13 <Daviey> adam_g: bug 1183634 ?

 16:13 <ubottu> bug 1183634 in cheetah (Ubuntu Saucy) "cheetah pkg does not depend on markdown, but egg requires.txt does" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1183634

 16:13 <rbasak> Sorry poor connection here

 16:13 <adam_g> Daviey, progressing, slowly. security team just started moving on the python-markdown MIR

 16:14 <adam_g> Daviey, should be good once thats done

 16:14 <Daviey> Super!

 16:14 <Daviey> I see they last touched it 20 hours ago.. so making progress

 16:15 <Daviey> bug 1170393, jamespage

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1170393 in quantum (Ubuntu Saucy) "Quantum services should be respawned by upstart if necessary" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1170393

 16:15 <jamespage> catching up on openstack this week

 16:16 <rbasak> Daviey: I don't follow. It looks like we're up-to-date with Debian on rrdtool?

 16:17 <Daviey> rbasak: No, that isn't the problem.. there is a lua transition needed, and that package is marked as depending on it

 16:17 <Daviey> Feels very similar to the ruby and mysql issues we had.. Keeps getting deferred, then someone does it blindly.. and that prompts issues to be flushed out.

 16:18 <rbasak> Daviey: oh, so a no change rebuild?

 16:18 <Daviey> rbasak: yah

 16:18 <rbasak> I have less objection to someone blindly doing a no change rebuild, since that shouldn't introduce any new issues that didn't already exist

 16:18 <rbasak> If I were doing it I'd test it first though

 16:19 <Daviey> ok

 16:19 <Daviey> zul: Do you know why apache2 is still held?

 16:19 <Daviey> (saucy-proposed)

 16:20 <rbasak> There's a big pile of breakages it would cause. I looked today - it looks like almost everything is waiting on Debian

 16:20 <zul> Daviey:  yeah one packaging is blocking it, its being fixed in debian

 16:20 <Daviey> zul: which package?

 16:20 <rbasak> zul: it looked like many more than one to me

 16:20 <rbasak> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_output.txt

 16:20 <zul> Daviey:  dont remember off the top of my head

 16:21 <rbasak> I counted 62 source packages in there

 16:21 <zul> uwsgi

 16:21 <Daviey> Does someone want to volunteer to get to grips of proposed migration issues this week?

 16:22 <Daviey> I'm seeing more server seed issues on excuses.html than we'd like

 16:22 <Daviey> zul: Fancy it  ^^ ?

 16:23 <zul> Daviey:  sure

 16:23 <zul> Daviey:  not really but ill do it

 16:23 <Daviey> #ACTION zul has willfully volunteered to review and document what is blocking server related saucy-proposed migration excuses, with joy.

 16:23 * meetingology zul has willfully volunteered to review and document what is blocking server related saucy-proposed migration excuses, with joy.

 16:23 <yolanda> !

 16:24 <yolanda> Daviey, any more bugs to review?

 16:24 <Daviey> bug 1196979 , jamespage - can you summarise ?

 16:24 <ubottu> bug 1196979 in ow-util-ant-tasks (Ubuntu Saucy) "[MIR] libasm4-java (b-d of jarjar)" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1196979

 16:24 <jamespage> transition

 16:24 <jamespage> I have it on my list

 16:24 <Daviey> ok, thanks

 16:25 <Daviey> rbasak: bug 1031680 , been a bunch of discussion. Do we have a plan?

 16:25 <ubottu> bug 1031680 in nagios-plugins (Ubuntu Raring) "check_apt always report 0 critical updates" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1031680

 16:26 <rbasak> Daviey: I'm happy with the plan xnox described on the ML. It needs someone to actually do it, though.

 16:26 <Daviey> rbasak: ok, thanks.

 16:26 <Daviey> Any more bugs?

 16:26 <Daviey> Blueprints.. Don't think we need to review them this week.

 16:27 <Daviey> Would like to check on.. juju-core, is there any progress on getting an update into saucy ?

 16:27 <Daviey> jamespage: ^ ?

 16:27 <jamespage> Daviey, I pinged mgz today - 1.1.1 of golang is now in saucy (I jumped the Debian maintainer and pushed a point release in myself)

 16:27 <Daviey> Super!

 16:28 <jamespage> mgz is going to work on that with davecheney ~soon

 16:28 <jamespage> end of this week latest I hope

 16:28 <Daviey> A General note.  Please make sure that if you are working on something, anything, it is captured as a WI.

 16:28 <jamespage> ^^^ that all is

 16:28 <Daviey> There are too many 0% progresses for the cycle and a 100% (!)

 16:28 <jamespage> also remember a work item can be a bug linked to a blueprint as well

 16:29 <Daviey> EOF, thanks

 16:29 <yolanda> ok

 16:31 <yolanda> ok

 16:31 <Daviey> But a bunch of ~ubuntu-server people are going to Openstack Summit in Honk Kong, November.

 16:31 <Daviey> But a little early to declare it

 16:32 <yolanda> any other events?
