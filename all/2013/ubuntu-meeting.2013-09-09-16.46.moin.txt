 16:47 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:47 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:48 <jdstrand> I need to go through bps, postpone some stuff, plan for september and tentative for 14.04, then get that info out to people

 16:48 <jdstrand> I also have some work items-- mostly around testing various apis and getting the policy groups in order

 16:48 <jdstrand> and pending updates

 16:48 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're next

 16:49 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:49 <mdeslaur> and friday, I have patch piloting duties

 16:49 <mdeslaur> this week I plan on working down the CVE list, it's been growing

 16:49 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 16:49 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:49 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor again this week

 16:50 <sbeattie> I'm again helping out jj with testing stuff, focusing on ipc

 16:50 <sbeattie> which is pretty much it for me

 16:50 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:51 <tyhicks> I'm fixing a couple remaining bugs in the C++ apparmor parser patch set

 16:51 <tyhicks> then I'll send those out to the list

 16:51 <tyhicks> I need to put together a pull request for a couple minor eCryptfs kernel fixes while the merge window is still open

 16:52 <tyhicks> then I expect to be doing some work related to trusted helpers

 16:52 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:52 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:53 <sarnold> I'm on community this week; I'm working on MIR audits this week, ust, mir, unity-system-compositor, msgpack-python, gunicorn, and open-vm-tools. I suspect I'll finish four of them this week...

 16:54 <sarnold> jdstrand: back to you
