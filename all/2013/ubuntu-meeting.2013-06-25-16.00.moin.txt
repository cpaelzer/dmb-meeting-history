 16:05 <roaksoax> jamespage: we did it for MAAS

 16:05 <roaksoax> a few packages were promoted to main

 16:05 <jamespage> roaksoax, OK

 16:06 <jamespage> I don't think any other release bugs warrant discussion - alot are SRU's in Fix Committed state

 16:06 <jamespage> so anyone with spare time - verification would be great!

 16:06 <jamespage> arosales, back to you

 16:07 <arosales> jamespage thank you sir

 16:09 <arosales> sorry for the delay

 16:09 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:10 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-saucy/group/topic-saucy-servercloud-overview.html

 16:10 <arosales> how are BPs looking . . .

 16:10 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-servercloud-overview.html

 16:10 <arosales> this one works a little better

 16:10 * arosales will udpate the IRC commands

 16:11 <jamespage> trend line needs a reset

 16:11 <jamespage> arosales, did you get to the bottom of my missing BP's?

 16:11 <arosales> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting/IRCCommands is updated

 16:16 <arosales> so BPs updated

 16:16 <arosales> lets take a look at essential ones

 16:17 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-juju-charm-testing

 16:17 <arosales> that is in progress

 16:17 <arosales> testing harness and plugin made

 16:18 * arosales needs to update BP .. .

 16:18 <arosales> actually that is the only essential BP

 16:19 <arosales> actually looks like we need to set priority on all our BPs

 16:19 <jamespage> agreed

 16:19 <arosales> can we make that a goal for this week?

 16:19 <jamespage> Daviey, ^^ only you can do that

 16:19 <arosales> #action Daviey set priority on s-cycle BPs

 16:19 * meetingology` Daviey set priority on s-cycle BPs

 16:20 <arosales> previous action didn't take

 16:20 <arosales> #action Daviey follow up on missing BPs from overview s-topic

 16:20 * meetingology Daviey follow up on missing BPs from overview s-topic

 16:20 <arosales> ok

 16:20 <arosales> any other BPs folks would like to discuss?

 16:21 <arosales> overall we look to be in the red on status, but I suspect that is due to BPs not being updated

 16:21 <arosales> ok, sounds like there is no other BPs that needs discussion

 16:21 <arosales> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21 <arosales> OSCON is the only upcoming one for the juju team

 16:21 <arosales> any others

 16:22 <arosales> btw OSCON is end of July

 16:22 <arosales> ok so moving on

 16:22 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:22 <plars> hi

 16:22 <plars> nothing major from me

 16:23 <plars> psivaa was able to help narrow down the kernel problem causing floodlight failures

 16:23 <plars> and jsalisbury found which change it was I think, so we should have a fix for that soon

 16:23 <arosales> plars, good to hear root cause on floodlight failures

 16:23 <arosales> plars, thanks for the update

 16:23 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:24 <arosales> smb: Hello are you available?

 16:26 <arosales> any questions for kernel we need to follow up on?

 16:26 <arosales> for the kernel team that is :-)

 16:26 <arosales> I take it that we are ok there

 16:26 <arosales> next topic

 16:26 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:26 * arosales doesn't see rbask atm

 16:27 <arosales> on the ARM front from Juju we are trying to testing juju-core on ARM for saucy

 16:27 <arosales> any other ARM related topics

 16:27 <jamespage> better get that compiler working for ARM then :-)

 16:28 <arosales> jamespage noted, and dave cheney is working on that bit of work

 16:28 <arosales> #topic Open Discussion

 16:28 <arosales> any other topics to discuss?

 16:29 <arosales> I think we have been saying for a bit now to get BPs udpated

 16:29 <arosales> so lets make a good push this week to get BPs udpated and priority sets so we can see the development picture next week.

 16:30 <arosales> with that we'll close this meeting

 16:30 <arosales> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:30 <arosales> NEXT MEETING: Tuesday 2013-07-02 at 1600 UTC - #ubuntu-meeting

 16:31 <arosales> jamespage, plars, Daviey, adam_g_ , roaksoax , smoser thanks for jonining this week!
