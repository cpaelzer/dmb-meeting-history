 16:11 <rbasak> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:12 <rbasak> caribou_: hi!

 16:12 <caribou_> nothing here

 16:14 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:14 <psivaa> no updates from us as well

 16:14 <rbasak> Any questions for psivaa?

 16:14 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:14 <smb> nothing to report. Are there questions?

 16:15 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:15 <smoser> hm..

 16:15 <smoser> go back one.

 16:15 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:15 <smoser> kernel team has *really* nice benchmark data that they're working on

 16:15 <smoser> http://kernel.ubuntu.com/benchmarking/

 16:16 <smoser> the data there may change formats or content, but its good too look at.

 16:16 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:17 <rbasak> I've been working on upstreaming portability patches for mongodb for armhf and arm64. This is reviewed upstream now and should land soon. Then I'll see if I can get Debian updated to a cherry-pick of the upstream patches.

 16:17 <rbasak> No other updates. Any questions for me?

 16:17 <rbasak> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:17 <rbasak> Christmas, I guess, is the reason why it's quiet.

 16:18 <rbasak> Any other new upcoming events?

 16:18 <rbasak> #topic Open Discussion

 16:18 <rbasak> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:18 <caribou_> Ho Ho Ho

 16:19 <rbasak> Due to the holidays, I propose that our next meeting should be in January when we're all back. Any objections?

 16:19 <hallyn_> nope

 16:20 <rbasak> So the next meeting will be at: Tue, 7 Jan 2014 16:00:00 +0000.

 16:20 <rbasak> Looks like next on the chair rota is roaksoax, so he'll be chairing. I know roaksoax is on holiday now, so I'll let him know by email.

 16:20 <rbasak> #endmeeting
