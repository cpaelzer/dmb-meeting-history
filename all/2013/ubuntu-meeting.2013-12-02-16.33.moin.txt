 16:33 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:33 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:33 <jdstrand> I'm on community this week

 16:33 <jdstrand> I've got another short week (off friday)

 16:33 <jdstrand> I need to catch up from last week-- I think I am not too bad at this point

 16:34 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: thanks for picking up the triage while I was out

 16:34 <mdeslaur> jdstrand: np!

 16:34 <jdstrand> there are a couple of updates I am eyeing

 16:34 <jdstrand> and a few work items

 16:34 <jdstrand> (I hope to upload a new apparmor-easyprof-ubuntu this week and write some image tests for it)

 16:35 <jdstrand> I've also got patch piloting

 16:35 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I have a few updates ready, but I've found issues with them, so they probably won't go out this week

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I'm currently still poking at getting rid of ruby1.8 from main for trusty

 16:36 <mdeslaur> and I'm patch piloting on wednesday

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I'll be picking up more CVE updates

 16:36 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 16:36 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor again this week.

 16:36 <mdeslaur> Oh, and I'll spend time evaluating whether we can turn tlsv1.2 back on in openssl in trusty

 16:37 <sbeattie> I'll again be working on testing improvements, both for IPC and other things...

 16:37 <sbeattie> as well as some non-IPC related parser fixes.

 16:37 <sbeattie> which is pretty much it for me.

 16:37 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:37 <jdstrand> sbeattie: how is that coming?

 16:38 <sbeattie> slow going, but making progress.

 16:38 <jdstrand> what kind of coverage do we have for jj's patches?

 16:39 <jdstrand> rough estimate? what is the plan wrt those testing improvements and putting things in a ppa and in Ubuntu?

 16:40 <jdstrand> s/rough estimate\?/(rough estimate)/

 16:40 <jjohansen> jdstrand: good question I need to sit down and coordinate with sbeattie

 16:40 <jjohansen> jdstrand: there will be a new test kernel this week

 16:40 <jdstrand> ok

 16:40 <jjohansen> however I wouldn't recommend it as something everyone install

 16:41 * jjohansen checks to see if there is anymore hair to pull out

 16:42 * tyhicks goes

 16:42 <tyhicks> I'm catching up from last week

 16:42 <tyhicks> I ended up spending a little more time than expected last monday debugging apparmor_parser so I didn't get much time to look into enabling yama on touch

 16:42 <jdstrand> tyhicks: did you get to the bottom of the segfaults?

 16:43 <tyhicks> I've done the investigation and now need to backport a simple patch that enables stacking yama with other lsms

 16:43 <tyhicks> jdstrand: yes

 16:43 <jdstrand> cool

 16:43 <tyhicks> apparmor_parser doesn't really handle multiple rule types very well

 16:43 <tyhicks> well, it handles multiple rule types as far as parsing them

 16:43 <jdstrand> tyhicks: idr if we mentioned goldfish as part of the yama work, but can you include it?

 16:43 <tyhicks> but doesn't track them very well internally

 16:44 <tyhicks> it turns out that jj has some patches in the works that improves the situation

 16:44 <tyhicks> jdstrand: definitely

 16:44 <tyhicks> after that, I'll start benchmarking ecryptfs and dm-crypt on arm

 16:44 <tyhicks> (for the user data encryption blueprint)

 16:45 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:45 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:46 * jjohansen is working on apparmor this week, I'll be getting out the next test kernel, coordinating with sbeattie, and hopefully digging out some parser patches to coordinate with tyhicks on

 16:48 <jjohansen> I think thats it for /me sarnold your up

 16:50 <sarnold> I'm on triage this week, thanks mdeslaur for filling in last week :) I'm making a good dent in the backlog of unreviewed AppArmor patches, it'd be nice to finish reviewing all the previously outstanding patches, and there's a new MIR audit requested for bbswitch that I'd like to get to this week

 16:51 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson, you're up :)

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:52 <jdstrand> jjohansen: oh, btw, is the goldfish patch in the goldfish kernel?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> i'm finishing off bug 1214049 this week (hopefully by tomorrow or wed at the latest). i've started pushing bits to https://code.launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/oxide/accelerated-rendering already

 16:52 <ubottu> bug 1214049 in Oxide "Support accelerated compositing" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1214049

 16:52 <jjohansen> jdstrand: no not yet

 16:52 * jdstrand nod

 16:52 <jdstrand> s

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> i got the packaging for oxide done last week, although it did fail to build in a PPA. i've fixed a few build issues as a result of that (see the last few commits in https://code.launchpad.net/~oxide-developers/oxide/oxide.trunk)

 16:53 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: what ppa are you using?

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> and i reviewed oSoMoN's navigation API work last week (https://code.launchpad.net/~osomon/oxide/navigation-api/+merge/196704/), which will land shortly

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, https://launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/+archive/ppa for now. i didn't want to waste an arm builder until there was a successful build on i386/amd64

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> as the round-trip time is quite long ;)

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 16:55 <jdstrand> ack

 16:55 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: istr you saying you had a particular ppa in mind for arm. which is that?

 16:55 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, i can probably use https://launchpad.net/~canonical-arm-dev/+archive/ppa

 16:56 * jdstrand is 'Not allowed here'

 16:56 <chrisccoulson> ah :)

 16:56 <ogra_> jdstrand, want access ?

 16:56 <chrisccoulson> it does exist :)

 16:56 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: I'm not sure what to suggest

 16:57 <jdstrand> sure, I'll take the access, but would it be better to use a public ppa so everyone can get their hands on it to test?

 16:57 <mdeslaur> can't we get a non-virtualized builder for oxide?

 16:57 <mdeslaur> s/builder/ppa/

 16:58 <jdstrand> I think we want daily builds for it too, but that is a slightly different topic

 16:58 <jdstrand> (however, those would also ideally be public)

 16:59 <chrisccoulson> who do we ask for a non-virtualized builder?

 17:00 <jdstrand> I would start with infinity

 17:00 <jdstrand> he may be the one to actually do the setup, but he might need some paperwork

 17:01 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: is that something you plan on working on this week?

 17:01 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, yeah, sure

 17:01 <jdstrand> cool, let's move on

 17:01 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: did you have anything else?

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, no, i'm done now

 17:02 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
