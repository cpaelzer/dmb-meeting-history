 16:08:32 <doko> back from skiing ...

 16:08:44 <infinity> doko: Do you still have legs?

 16:09:06 <slangasek> not sure we need a lightning round to talk about what we got for Christmas

 16:09:09 <doko> still somehow working, couldn't resist the powder however ...

 16:10:41 <slangasek> well, what the heck; we can still do a lightning round to talk about what we're working on this week :)

 16:10:47 <slangasek> [TOPIC] lightning round

 16:11:10 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber jodh ev bdmurray slangasek ogra cjwatson xnox stokachu)

 16:11:13 <slangasek> stokachu cjwatson doko barry slangasek ev stgraber bdmurray jodh ogra xnox

 16:11:21 * xnox win

 16:11:23 <slangasek> stokachu: around?

 16:12:15 <slangasek> cjwatson: your turn!

 16:12:19 <cjwatson> Spent some time over the Christmas break poking at removing nested functions from GRUB, which will no doubt make the security team happy if I manage to land it.  Planning to spend a bit more time pushing that up the hill this week, along with switching our GRUB packaging to GCC 4.7.

 16:12:34 <cjwatson> Also continuing work on britney/autopkgtest and preparing for the 12.04.2 point release.

 16:12:46 <cjwatson> (We need to finish off the SB landings ...)

 16:12:46 <cjwatson> ..

 16:12:58 <slangasek> indeed we do :/

 16:13:07 <slangasek> doko:

 16:13:28 <doko> looked at the cross buildability for buildd chroots, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrossBuilding/BuilddChroot

 16:14:09 <doko> todo for the next week: evaluating ftbfs for the test rebuilds, cross build fixes

 16:14:11 <doko> ..

 16:14:12 <infinity> I'll get the eglibc parts of that fixed along with the 2.17 upload.

 16:14:22 <slangasek> doko: I was going to ask, I notice that dbus says 'requires python-dbus' but there's no comment on why dbus-python doesn't build

 16:14:37 <doko> circular b-d

 16:14:45 <slangasek> ok

 16:14:52 * xnox fixed e2fsprogs & commented about shadow.

 16:15:04 * barry was quasi-blissfully semi-offline for the xmas break.  todo: finish up oneconf, and then the usual.  done.

 16:15:58 <slangasek> so I accomplished none of the things I had put on my list to work on over break, because instead I've wound up prepping for a surprise trip to China

 16:16:12 <xnox> \0/ awesome =)

 16:16:19 <slangasek> which is from 5-9 Jan

 16:16:21 <doko> cjwatson, should we drop versioned b-d's where the package builds otherwise?

 16:16:50 <cjwatson> doko: example?

 16:16:55 <doko> cjwatson, perl

 16:16:58 <infinity> doko: I really think we need better ways to mangle build-deps in the build process.

 16:17:01 <barry> slangasek: hopefully for fun!

 16:17:15 <doko> cjwatson, or eglibc

 16:17:17 <infinity> doko: Cause versioned build-deps are often correct and sane (especially for people attempting to backport)

 16:17:21 <cjwatson> yeah, what infinity said, we should fix that in sbuild

 16:17:23 <slangasek> I'll also be off this Friday as a swap day; and I won't have any of my keys with me (or even my laptop) so don't expect me to be doing any other work those days :)

 16:17:31 <slangasek> barry: it's work :)

 16:17:38 <barry> ah well

 16:17:46 <cjwatson> and I'd like to keep those around as good test cases

 16:17:49 <doko> cjwatson, hmm, but that won't work for dpkg-buildpackage?

 16:18:28 <infinity> Yeah, the cross-fu almost needs to be in dpkg-checkbuilddeps.

 16:18:43 <cjwatson> sbuild and dpkg-checkbuilddeps, yes

 16:18:44 * xnox is next, I guess.....

 16:18:46 <infinity> (Though sbuild also needs to know about it)

 16:18:49 <slangasek> so other than trying to get everything in order for that trip & associated presentations next week, I still need to get the gnu-efi regression sorted out to follow through on the SB updates

 16:18:54 <cjwatson> I don't see why we can't do it for both - I just haven't got round to it yet

 16:19:02 <slangasek> and that's probably about as much as you can expect me to get done this week

 16:19:05 <slangasek> ..

 16:19:06 <bdmurray> xnox: I'm next but waiting for a done

 16:19:10 <cjwatson> seeing as we only really came up with the general mangling idea in Dec

 16:19:45 <xnox> bdmurray: hello =) sorry, I missread holiday calendar.

 16:26:44 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything needing our attention this week?

 16:26:48 <doko> xnox, could you update the wiki page about e2fsprogs?

 16:26:56 <xnox> doko: I did =)

 16:27:06 <slangasek> hmm, am I still connected? :)

 16:27:07 <bdmurray> slangasek: no, not this week

 16:28:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:28:39 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:28:44 <infinity> Hinted at it above, but since I don't do the lightning round anymore, should mention it harder: I plan to upload eglibc 2.17 this week.

 16:28:49 <slangasek> xnox: maybe you should change e2fsprogs from red to green though :)

 16:28:59 <slangasek> infinity: nice

 16:29:39 <xnox> slangasek: well. I want to wait for green light from cjwatson's cloud cross-builder.

 16:29:50 <slangasek> ok

 16:30:17 <xnox> doko: new shadow, will add ustr & libsemanage to min. chroot.

 16:30:37 <xnox> which I noted to fix cross-build for.

 16:30:45 <cjwatson> anyone fancy sitting on the security team's head 'til they make a decision about libsemanage? :)

 16:31:06 <xnox> cjwatson: they did "fix commit" it.

 16:31:09 <xnox> on the bug.

 16:31:23 <cjwatson> ah yes

 16:31:36 * infinity does some promotion dances.

 16:32:29 <xnox> AOB: new shadow upstream release about to hit raring =)

 16:33:02 <cjwatson> bdmurray: could you subscribe foundations-bugs to libsemanage?

 16:33:24 <xnox> and ustr?

 16:33:26 <cjwatson> bdmurray: and ustr as well

 16:33:28 <cjwatson> snap :)

 16:34:15 <xnox> =))))))
