 16:03 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Lightning round

 16:03 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber jodh bdmurray slangasek cjwatson xnox stokachu)

 16:03 <slangasek> doko stokachu xnox jodh slangasek stgraber barry bdmurray cjwatson

 16:04 <slangasek> doko: you first :)

 16:04 <doko> - configury fixes for a bootstrap build

 16:04 <doko> - openjdk-7 disable hotspot on i386, alignment issue with glibc 2.18.

 16:04 <doko> - port openjdk zero to ppc64el

 16:04 <doko> - update llvm to 3.4, mir b-d's, build mesa with 3.4.

 16:04 <doko> - build fixes for the indicator stack to build update-notifier

 16:04 <doko> - gcc-snapshot update

 16:05 <doko> - and fixing hardening-wrapper

 16:05 <doko> - gdb updated to the trunk

 16:05 <doko> /done

 16:05 <slangasek> oh, gdb, great :)

 16:06 <xnox> i assume stokachu is still out

 16:06 <slangasek> yes

 16:06 <xnox> * uploaded initial cmake cross-compilation support (positive response

 16:06 <xnox> and constructive further plans discussions from that)

 16:06 <xnox> * fixed-up some of the cross-compilations issues in packages using

 16:06 <xnox> cmake (e.g. executing compiled binaries, when cross-compiling)

 16:06 <xnox> * fixed-up broken toolchain-base packages for arm* (due to eglibc 2.17

 16:06 <xnox> -> 2.18 bump) p*pc* are still to do

 16:06 <xnox> * uploaded changes to android & autopilot to resolve executing

 16:06 <xnox> autopilot tests under the emulator. At request from evan, tested

 16:06 <slangasek> (and he hasn't designated a surrogate, so)

 16:06 <xnox> that a single host can execute multiple emulators, still need to

 16:06 <xnox> check if it can also be done in a VM, without proper graphics card.

 16:06 <xnox> * still to do in the emulator - unlock higher RAM memory, currently

 16:06 <xnox> capped at 760MB due to memory map issues (kernel panics, segfaults

 16:06 <xnox> with higher values.)

 16:06 <xnox> * Running autopilot tests documented in this part of the wiki

 16:06 <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Emulator#Using_the_emulator

 16:06 <xnox> * merged boost, and split python-pyste to demote gccxml to universe.

 16:06 <xnox> * still to do resolve device name of the "generic", for system-image

 16:06 <xnox> updates in the emulator

 16:06 <xnox> ..

 16:07 <jodh`> * upstart: cgroup:

 16:07 <jodh`> - Continued work on cgroup support. Improved the internal

 16:07 <jodh`> representation of a cgroup (currently updating tests to reflect

 16:07 <jodh`> this).

 16:07 <jodh`> - cgmanager discussions with hallyn+stgraber.

 16:07 <jodh`> * misc: short week - out yesterday.

 16:07 <jodh`> ס֙

 16:07 <slangasek> xnox: emulator \o/  but hmm, I guess the question isn't whether we can run them in a VM, but whether they will perform well enough to be worth anything

 16:08 <barry> slangasek: seems like boot (maybe disk access?) is quite slow, but cli performance doesn't seem too bad once it's booted

 16:09 <xnox> slangasek: it's both. using juju / openstack instances is preferred over having a physical bare-metal box contention.

 16:10 <xnox> slangasek: and performance.... cpu emulation is still slow and there is no obvious way to crank up emulated cpu speed, unless we start using generic-x86 builds with accelerated kvm style emulation.

 16:10 <xnox> slangasek: which will take us into the nested kvm bugs, once again ;-)

 16:10 <xnox> jodh`: has nested kvm been resolved at all, in the case of upstart tests?

 16:10 <slangasek> yes, yes, it would

 16:10 <slangasek> xnox: not in the least

 16:11 <slangasek> barry: cli performance is not what we are testing :)

 16:11 <xnox> slangasek: excellent, the more i do the more there is to do.....

 16:11 <slangasek> * recruiting for the Foundations Team opening

 16:11 <slangasek> * bootstrapping/porting work

 16:11 <slangasek> * release engineering for alpha 1

 16:11 <slangasek> * fix libfreetype-dev dependencies so things using freetype-config don't FTBFS

 16:11 <barry> slangasek: yeah, i know

 16:11 <slangasek> (done)

 16:12 <stgraber> Done:

 16:12 <stgraber> - CGroup Manager

 16:12 <stgraber> - Helped with design work.

 16:12 <stgraber> - LXC

 16:12 <stgraber> - Release 1.0~beta1 on Tuesday, updated our packaging and uploaded

 16:12 <stgraber> - Finished implementing the container autostart specification (patched up for review now)

 16:12 <slangasek> specifically: we're exercising autopilot tests, which run the gui

 16:12 <stgraber> - Finished work on the configure-overview branch and landed upstream.

 16:12 <stgraber> - Tried to debug and ended up working around an issue with clang-3.4 (reverted to 3.2 for now as it looked like a compiler/parser bug).

 16:12 <stgraber> - The usual set of code reviews

 16:12 <stgraber> - Ubuntu touch

 16:12 <stgraber> - Enabled discard use by default (once initamfs-tools-ubuntu-touch manages to build...)

 16:12 <stgraber> - Fixed a rather critical bug in the upgrader code (factory reset would also wipe the system)

 16:12 <stgraber> - Other

 16:12 <stgraber> - SRU and New reviews

 16:12 <stgraber> - A couple of merges

 16:12 <stgraber> - TODO tomorrow: OpenVPN packaging fixups, a couple more minor LXC changes to work better with unpriv containers and maybe some networking work if time allows

 16:12 <stgraber> - Holidays

 16:12 <stgraber> - I was off on yesterday

 16:12 <stgraber> - I'll be working tomorrow, then off till the 2nd

 16:12 <stgraber> (DONE)

 16:13 <barry> system-image: LP: #1256229, LP: #1260712.  started looking at system-image and autopilot on emulator; filed some emulator and u-d-m bugs with issues found - with those fixed, we're probably not too far off from system-image working in emulator.

 16:14 <xnox> barry: yeah, IO is horribly, emulated SDCARD speeds. there is even code to emulated / delay it further. i need to make sure it is not delayed. But i think, the IO speed is lightning times faster than the emulated CPU speed, so actually unrealisticly performed IO is emulated for the given CPU, I think =)

 16:14 <bdmurray> sorted out an issue with the release upgrader tarball building

 16:14 <bdmurray> resolved an issue with the creation of demoted.cfg files in the ubuntu-release-upgrader dist-upgrade tarball

 16:14 <bdmurray> test and modification of back population for counter for release:src_pkg:src_pkg_version

 16:14 <bdmurray> done

 16:16 <stgraber> doko: if you're interested by what may be a llvm bug when building LXC under clang I can poke you about it afterwards. (It looks to me like it's wrongly reporting unused functions)

 16:16 <doko> stgraber, clang is in universe =)

 16:17 <stgraber> doko: sure and we still use and recommend gcc by default, but I like to have our QA setup build on more than one compiler just to make sure we're not doing anything too gcc-specific in there

 16:18 <doko> stgraber, yes, but ENOTIME

 16:18 <slangasek> and no cjwatson today, so that's all of us

 16:18 <slangasek> any questions?

 16:18 <xnox> slangasek: when is the next meeting?

 16:18 <slangasek> xnox: January!

 16:19 <slangasek> January 8?

 16:19 <stgraber> doko: ok :) For now I've just hardcoded clang-3.2 in our test suite and that's done the trick, hopefully someone who actually cares enough will debug and fix that problem at some point ;)

 16:19 <slangasek> no, January 2

 16:19 <doko> 2015?

 16:19 <doko> stgraber, did you check 3.4?

 16:19 <slangasek> doko: I hope you don't count array indices the way you count years ;)

 16:20 <xnox> slangasek: is there much point in 2nd jan meeting? i guess it will be a rather quick one anyway.

 16:20 <slangasek> xnox: hmmmm

 16:20 <bdmurray> doko: could you have a look at bug 1261604?

 16:20 <ubottu> bug 1261604 in gcc-4.8 (Ubuntu) "static binaries compiled with gccgo can fail to set up their address space" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1261604

 16:20 <slangasek> xnox: good point, we can skip it

 16:21 <xnox> slangasek: endianess is ok, so it's almost the right count =)

 16:21 <slangasek> xnox: let's still do the mumble chat though :)

 16:21 <xnox> ack.

 16:21 <stgraber> doko: yep, 3.2 and 3.3 work, 3.4 doesn't

 16:21 <doko> bdmurray, yes, next year

 16:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:22 <slangasek> anything else?  Christmas shopping recommendations?  Eggnog recipes?

 16:22 <barry> slangasek: for all the pythonistas out there: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/26-pound-edible-gummy-python-candy.cfm

 16:23 <slangasek> oh my

 16:23 <jodh`> love that calorie count!

 16:23 * barry feels his breathing constricted just thinking about it

 16:23 <slangasek> it doesn't list calories per serving?

 16:24 <slangasek> haha, http://images1.vat19.com/party-python/gummy-python-8-feet-long.jpg

 16:24 <xnox> barry: 7 foot, i would have thought a 3.4 foot long variant is needed

 16:24 <barry> xnox: metric

 16:24 <barry> :)

 16:24 <jodh`> slangasek: only per snake :)

 16:24 * barry wonders how many pig hooves go into something like that

 16:25 <xnox> bloke with a steak knife eating it is hallarious pic!

 16:25 <xnox> "Thankfully, the gigantic gummy Party Python has a shelf life of a year."

 16:26 <barry> they also have the world largest gummy bears

 16:26 <barry> and gummy bears on a stick (everything is better when it's on a stick)

 16:26 <xnox> Question: Don't you think this is a bit absurd for a piece of candy?

 16:26 <xnox> Answer: You must be new to our website. You need to check out this, this, this, this, this, and this. Oh, and this. While we're at it, check out this. It's not candy, but it is absurdly large.

 16:26 <xnox> with "this" all URLs =)
