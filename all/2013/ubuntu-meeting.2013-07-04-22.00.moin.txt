 22:00 <hggdh> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for July 4th, 2013.

 22:00 <IdleOne> o/

 22:00 <PabloRubianes> hello all

 22:00 <iulian> \o

 22:00 <hggdh> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:01 <hggdh> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:01 <hggdh> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:01 <hggdh> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:01 <hggdh> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:23 <Ck> hello next ?

 22:24 <IdleOne> patience :)

 22:24 <thohi> :)

 22:24 <kokoye2007> we are sleepless local 4:30 AM  IdleOne  :P

 22:25 <IdleOne> For all the people who applied from Myanmar. We are happy that such a large number of you want to become Ubuntu members. We do have some concerns though...

 22:25 <htutmyat> :)

 22:25 <PabloRubianes> kokoye2007, I told the Myanmar this time was not so good for you

 22:26 <Ethan-Kurt> We all really are contributor and we hope to be a Ubuntu-Member

 22:26 <lugyimin> :)

 22:26 <IdleOne> The main concern we have is that all of your wiki pages appear to be very similar in terms of contributions. We like to see a more personal listing of what each member has done on his/her own.

 22:26 <iulian> We don't offer membership to a group, but rather to individuals. It looks like all your wiki pages are the same,  more or less. The testimonials have been given between you guys, except for one person who's already a member (Pyae Sone). Having said that, I would like you to put some effort in writing your own wiki page with detailed explanation of what your contributions are.

 22:27 <iulian> We are sure that you guys are doing good work out there but your wiki pages are way too similar. So we cannot really judge who's doing what.

 22:27 <IdleOne> So, what the Membership Board has decided to do is to postpone the voting to our email list and give you all an extra 7 days before we start voting.

 22:28 <iulian> Or you guys can even extend that 7 days to whatever you think is best for you.

 22:28 <Ethan-Kurt> We can also write down in here.

 22:28 <Ck> becuse of we contributing with group in Myanmar . We go together all around the state .

 22:28 <kokoye2007> all are Ubuntu-MM Core Memer

 22:28 <IdleOne> We hope you all understand that we want to make sure we have all the information possible so that we can make the best decision for the Ubuntu community.

 22:28 <kokoye2007> _member

 22:29 <Ethan-Kurt> In our country, it's 05:00am and we didn't sleep just for a while

 22:29 <Ck> that's why our team leader make a templates.

 22:29 <Ck> What we all are...

 22:29 <Ethan-Kurt> sure! our template are the same because we contributed together

 22:29 <kokoye2007> when we go event and make event

 22:29 <Ethan-Kurt> that's why we have the same template

 22:29 <kokoye2007> together whenever

 22:30 <Ethan-Kurt> you can see our activities at  http://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntu-mm

 22:30 <iulian> Ethan-Kurt: Then please document that in your wiki pages. Like we said above we don't grant membership to an entire group.

 22:30 <PabloRubianes> I understand that but this is an individual process

 22:30 <kokoye2007> all about is my mistake

 22:30 <htutmyat> Why not the chance like the 2 above ?

 22:31 <Ethan-Kurt> Our individual project is shown on "About me"

 22:31 <saimawnkham> its ok.

 22:31 <saimawnkham> i quit

 22:31 <htutmyat> you can dicusss with each ,that are not real or not ,right ?

 22:31 <kokoye2007> who is ubuntu-mm core member - approval in template :(

 22:31 <kokoye2007> upset

 22:31 <iulian> Ethan-Kurt: No, that section is just "About me". It's not saying anything about your contributions to Ubuntu.

 22:32 <kokoye2007> who seen wiki, who see activity

 22:32 <Ethan-Kurt> Dear iulian, it's okay you decided like this.

 22:32 <chilicui1> let's make this clear, we're not rejecting your applications, we just want to make sure we're not approving in batch, so we're giving you 7 more days to polish your wiki pages, then we'll vote for your approval

 22:32 <Ethan-Kurt> I can still contribute even I am not the member of Ubuntu

 22:32 <IdleOne> Please try to understand that we are not trying to punish anybody. What we want is to give each one of you the best possible chance at approval.

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> I've just seen the contributing power

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> no wiki

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> whatever, you are the boardmember.

 22:33 <IdleOne> We are not rejecting any of you at this time

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> you can decided what you want to

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> thanks

 22:33 <IdleOne> I want that to be clear

 22:33 <yeminn> I see, chilicui1 :)

 22:33 <Ethan-Kurt> upset :(

 22:33 <IdleOne> kokoye2007: you are the loco contact correct?

 22:34 <kokoye2007> yes IdleOne

 22:34 <kokoye2007> i am ubuntu-mm leader and ubuntu-member

 22:34 <IdleOne> ok Please hold for a moment

 22:34 <Ck> We are grouply contributing Ubuntu in our country . and than Yangon city Development Committe (YCDC) already change Ubuntu Os because of  our team.our group .

 22:35 <kokoye2007> but they are real activity Ubuntu Contributor

 22:35 <kokoye2007> ok skip it. ;P

 22:35 <Ck> that'swhy we always says I am what I am because of who we all are.

 22:35 <IdleOne> kokoye2007: you did not make any mistakes. Everybody please calm down

 22:35 <Ethan-Kurt> Most of my times have been passed by contributing Ubuntu

 22:35 <PabloRubianes> please could you hold the chat a little

 22:35 <Ck> and than We can't sleep for hole night .

 22:37 <iulian> Please don't get us wrong here. We are just trying to point you guys in the right direction so that next time when you come to the meeting we won't have to talk about this matters again. We have acknowledged the fact that you guys are doing excellent job with your group.

 22:37 <Ethan-Kurt> Okay.

 22:37 <Ethan-Kurt> I'm done with all of you

 22:37 <iulian> It's just that we cannot really judge who is doing what. Maybe someone is doing much more than the other and we wouldn't want to grant membership to someone who's not doing anything or the like.

 22:38 <Ethan-Kurt> I will share this meeting log

 22:38 <Ethan-Kurt> in Google+ and

 22:38 <Ethan-Kurt> let decided the ppl

 22:42 <neo31> Thank you hggdh, hello dear members.

 22:42 <neo31> I am Ahmed Sghaier, a Tunisian software engineer and a network security and services IT specialist. My first experience with Linux was in 2002 and switched to it as my main OS in 2005.

 22:42 <neo31> Later in 2008 I have joined Ubuntu Tunisian LoCo team and became an active member in 2009.

 22:42 <neo31> I have been approved as a Freedom Fighter (approved active members) in the team in 2010 and joined the management commitee of the team in 2011.

 22:42 <chilicui1> hi neo31 welcome

 22:43 <neo31> In 2012 I was assisting our LoCo contact when possible, and I have been approved as the official LoCo contact in 2013 election. I am also now the secretary general of CLibre, a FLOSS NGO supporting Tunisian communities.

 22:43 <neo31> I have contributed to 25 IRL events during last years (local, national and international events as a speaker, workshop trainer, coordinator, organizer or assistant). I have contributed also on IRC, ML, forums and many of our sub teams (media, events, relations, documentation and reporting)

 22:43 <neo31> hi chilicui1 :)

 22:43 <neo31> this is my wiki page for review : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AhmedSghaier

 22:44 <chilicui1> neo31, do you photos or links to the conferences you've participated?

 22:44 <alaya> hi, I'm the former loco contact of Ubuntu-tn and a Ubuntu Member. I'm here to support Neo31

 22:45 <neo31> yes chilicui1 there are many links on events page

 22:45 <iulian> alaya: Great.

 22:45 <neo31> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/Events

 22:45 <chilicui1> neo31: thanks

 22:45 <neo31> some other links could be found also on our team report page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/TeamReports

 22:46 <neo31> I have uploaded some photos today to https://plus.google.com/photos/109786888015890437987/albums/5896864064045728145?authkey=CKrv-ITLl4a2Ow

 22:46 <neo31> unfortunately on of our main photos source got down lately and I am recollecting some other photos

 22:47 <neo31> but alaya can confirm my contributions to the events you want

 22:47 <chilicui1> I've seen you're interested in becoming a MOTU, however your lp account don't reflect activity in that area, are you having issues there?

 22:48 <neo31> we have been working on packaging workshops during UGJ

 22:49 <neo31> now that we have enough knowledge about packaging and how it works I became interested in joining the MOTU team

 22:49 <alaya> I confirm the participation of neo. there is a little problem in the servers of the free community here in tunisia (I have conctacted the admin)

 22:49 <neo31> I will be seeking a MOTU sponsor before next UGJ and organize some IRC classrooms for the team

 22:50 <chilicui1> got it neo31, just wondering

 22:50 <neo31> Then I will start contributing real packages to next releases before I apply to join the MOTU team

 22:50 <neo31> :) good chilicui1

 22:50 <iulian> neo31: #ubuntu-motu is always there to help you. ;-)

 22:50 <micahg> sounds good, MOTU can always use more help :)
