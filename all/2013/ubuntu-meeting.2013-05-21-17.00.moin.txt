 17:01 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] ARM Status (ppisati)

 17:01 <ppisati> Q/master: lp1176977 ("XFS instability on armhf under load") - working with

 17:01 <ppisati> upstream on this one: i already backported a fix that turn the vmalloc() exhaustion

 17:01 <ppisati> and fs shutdown to an -ENOSPC error, and this second error seems to be triggered

 17:01 <ppisati> by the tiny fs used in these tests (~2GB). Still working to get it

 17:01 <ppisati> properly fixed.

 17:01 <ppisati> R/master: lp1171582("[highbank] hvc0 getty causes random hangs") -

 17:01 <ppisati> the jtag console has a 1-char producer-consumer buffer and if there's no

 17:01 <ppisati> real hw attached to the board, any subsequent write turn into an endless loop

 17:01 <ppisati> waiting for a consumer. The situation is worsened by the fact

 17:01 <ppisati> that before writing to this register a tty spinlocked is taken, and

 17:02 <ppisati> any subsequent tentative to pick this spinlock makes the thread hang -

 17:02 <ppisati> got a confirmation of the problem, some info about the hw, and i'm working on this.

 17:02 <ppisati> ..

 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Release Metrics and Incoming Bugs (jsalisbury)

 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Milestone Targeted Work Items (ogasawara)

 17:02 <ogasawara> [LINK] https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-distro-team/+upcomingwork

 17:02 <ogasawara> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-saucy/canonical-kernel-distro-team.html

 17:02 <ogasawara> The burn down charts have not yet been reset for 13.10, so disregard the

 17:02 <ogasawara> second link posted abovefor now.  I'll be cleaning up and adding work

 17:02 <ogasawara> items for 13.10 so that the +upcomingwork link will be more accurate.

 17:02 <ogasawara> Next week I'll have the usual nag table available.

 17:02 <ogasawara> ..

 17:03 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Saucy Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:03 <ogasawara> For now, we'll plan on targetting the v3.10 kernel for Saucy but will

 17:03 <ogasawara> strongly re-evaluate a move to v3.11 in the coming months.  We've just

 17:03 <ogasawara> rebased Saucy to v3.10-rc2 and are still cleaning up some of the

 17:03 <ogasawara> carnage.  I don't anticipate we'll upload until a later -rc which will

 17:03 <ogasawara> hopefully provide more stability.

 17:03 <ogasawara> Importand upcoming dates:

 17:03 <ogasawara> Thurs June 20 - Alpha 1 (opt in)

 17:03 <ogasawara> ..

 17:03 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: CVE's (sconklin)

 17:04 <sconklin> == 2013-05-21 (28 days) ==
