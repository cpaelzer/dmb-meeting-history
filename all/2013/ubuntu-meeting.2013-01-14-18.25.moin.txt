 18:27:30 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:27:35 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:27:44 <jdstrand> I'm on triage today

 18:28:16 <jdstrand> rather, this week

 18:29:05 <jdstrand> I planned to get nss out last week, but was unable. I need to do new upstream releases for nss and nspr for this update, and I spent last week preparing those

 18:29:13 <jdstrand> that should go out today or tomorrow

 18:29:57 <jdstrand> chromium-browser (as mentioned) is now at 23.0.1271.97 for the stable releases, but upstream releases 24 last week, so I'll be sponsoring/testing that as well

 18:30:06 <mdeslaur> Â±o/

 18:30:10 <mdeslaur> argh

 18:30:27 <mdeslaur> \o/

 18:30:31 <jdstrand> I'm going to look at the recent java issue some more

 18:31:06 <jdstrand> and I need to patch pilot

 18:31:09 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 18:31:18 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 18:31:33 <mdeslaur> I've just released a couple of security updates, and will pick some more off the list

 18:32:11 <mdeslaur> and that's pretty much it. sbeattie, you're up

 18:32:27 <sbeattie> I'm again an apparmor monkey this week

 18:33:01 <sbeattie> My primary focus is on getting the display manager prototype going

 18:33:45 <sbeattie> I'm not sure where jjohansen is on getting the alpha out the door, but may pitch in to help on that after getting 2.8.1 out last week.

 18:34:05 <sbeattie> I'll also poke at the random things that have popped up on the list.

 18:34:17 <sbeattie> that's it for me. tyhicks?

 18:34:27 <tyhicks> Similar to last week. Embargoed item and apparmor policy kernel interface.

 18:34:39 <tyhicks> That's it for me. Back to you, jdstrand

 18:35:06 <jdstrand> actually, we skipped sarnold

 18:35:10 <jdstrand> sarnold: you're up

 18:35:20 <mdeslaur> who's sarnold?

 18:35:20 <tyhicks> sorry, sarnold :)

 18:35:22 <mdeslaur> :)

 18:35:33 <sarnold> I'm in happy place this week, hoping to make forward progress on dnsmasq update, now using mdeslaur's suggestion for VM with two NICs, will combine with jdstrand's suggestion to use two VMs rather than do the testing via my host...

 18:36:54 <sarnold> .. but if I have more trouble reproducing the reporter's situation, I'll be leaning towards just regression testing.

 18:37:10 <mdeslaur> sarnold: sounds reasonable

 18:37:37 <sarnold> (I'm thinking end-of-the-day today as the decision point...)

 18:37:57 <sarnold> jdstrand: back to you

 18:38:16 <mdeslaur> sarnold: you can get one of us to review your changes too, as a sanity check/second opinion since it affects an important package

 18:38:36 <sarnold> mdeslaur: thanks :)

 18:38:44 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:38:50 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 18:38:54 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 18:39:35 <jdstrand> Normally we provide a list of 5 packages. However, this week I'd like to ask for help on updating the recent raills vulnerabilities:

 18:40:28 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 18:40:34 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 18:43:34 <jdstrand> mdeslaur, sbeattie, tyhicks, sarnold: thanks!
