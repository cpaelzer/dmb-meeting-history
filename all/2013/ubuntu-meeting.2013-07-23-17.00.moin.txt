 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Saucy Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:02 <ogasawara> We have recently uploaded a new 3.10.0-5.14 Saucy kernel to the archive.

 17:02 <ogasawara> This includes the v3.10.2 upstream stable patch set, as well as a fix

 17:02 <ogasawara> for a regression which was causing graphics failures on boot.  We have

 17:02 <ogasawara> also rebased our unstable branch to begin tracking v3.11-rc2.

 17:02 <ogasawara> I also want to again point out that the 12.04.3 point release is

 17:02 <ogasawara> approaching on Thurs Aug 22.  Any kernel patches needing to land in the

 17:02 <ogasawara> 12.04.3 point release need to be applied to our Raring kernel tree on

 17:02 <ogasawara> or before Mon July 29 in order to hit the SRU cadence before the point

 17:02 <ogasawara> release.  Please get any patches submitted to the mailing list for

 17:02 <ogasawara> proper review as soon as possible.

 17:02 <ogasawara> Important upcoming dates:

 17:02 <ogasawara> Thurs July 25 - Alpha 2 (opt in, 2 days)

 17:02 <ogasawara> Thurs Aug 22 - 12.04.3 (~4 weeks)
