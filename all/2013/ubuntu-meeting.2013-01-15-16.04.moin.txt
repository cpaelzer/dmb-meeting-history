 16:05:09 <Ursinha> arosales, is the wiki page updated?

 16:05:31 <arosales> I don't think m_3 updated from the last meeting minutes . . .

 16:05:38 <arosales> :-(

 16:06:51 <Daviey> no

 16:07:05 <arosales> sorry, I got that wrong

 16:07:07 <arosales> we are moving to http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:07:35 <arosales> thanks

 16:07:44 <arosales> IRC commands were updated

 16:08:00 * arosales is still looking into status tracker is not picking up servercloud area

 16:08:01 <Ursinha> arosales, okay, I thought that page was outdated, was looking for the logs

 16:08:12 <arosales> #action arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up all servercloud area BPs

 16:08:12 * meetingology arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up all servercloud area BPs

 16:08:30 <arosales> Ursinha: it is a little behind, sorry about that

 16:08:41 <arosales> I was just going to run through those real quick as I had some context

 16:08:47 <Ursinha> sure, go ahead :)

 16:08:58 <arosales> jamespage, smoser: BP approval look good?

 16:09:32 <smoser> i think we should call that shipped. if you have a BP that is not approved at this point, please raise that with myself, Daviey or james_w

 16:09:35 <smoser> or even jamespage

 16:09:40 <smoser> (sorry james_w)

 16:09:45 <arosales> thanks smoser

 16:09:45 <arosales> Ursinha: all yours. I think that covers the action items from last week.

 16:13:54 <arosales> zul: you feel ok with https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-grizzly

 16:14:04 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow needs to be re-scoped, most likely

 16:14:19 <zul> arosales: yep

 16:14:29 <Daviey> arosales: zul isn't here right now.. That blueprint looks in a worse state than it is.  The progress is actually good

 16:14:34 <Daviey> oh, zul is here

 16:14:44 <arosales> zul: ok, thanks

 16:14:51 <zul> Daviey: barely

 16:15:00 * zul is on medication

 16:15:07 <arosales> I think jamespage is driving https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow correct?

 16:15:21 <Daviey> #ACTION zul, go and rest

 16:15:21 * meetingology zul, go and rest

 16:17:14 <Daviey> smoser: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-ubuntu-images might want a little love, can you take a gander at that at somepoint?

 16:18:20 <roaksoax> the ha stuff is in the HA BP

 16:18:23 <Daviey> Infact, i have a feeling that many (myself included) are behind on keeping the NBP status updated.. We should all take a check before next meeting

 16:18:44 <Daviey> #ACTION All, check status of assigned Work Items and refresh if necessary

 16:18:44 * meetingology All, check status of assigned Work Items and refresh if necessary

 16:19:23 <roaksoax> Daviey: i modified the charm to support DRBD

 16:19:45 <Daviey> so, shal we mark that BP dead.. and track in your HA BP?

 16:19:58 <roaksoax> Daviey: yeah i'm tracking HA for MySQL in the HA BP

 16:20:04 <Daviey> (I assume clint won't work on that now?)

 16:20:13 <Daviey> ok, lets kill it for now

 16:20:16 <Daviey> thanks
