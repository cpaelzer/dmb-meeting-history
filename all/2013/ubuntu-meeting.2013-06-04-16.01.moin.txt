 16:03 <smoser> #topic Raring Development

 16:03 <smoser> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule

 16:04 <smoser> hm..

 16:04 <smoser> where is our url for pretty graphs like https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule

 16:04 <smoser> gah

 16:04 <smoser> like

 16:04 <roaksoax> o/

 16:04 <smb> Sounds a tad outdated?

 16:04 <smoser> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/

 16:04 <arosales> I just updated them, I think another kind person originally made it.

 16:04 <arosales> smoser, I think I need to make a topic url

 16:04 <smoser> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule

 16:04 <arosales> sorry a topic blueprint

 16:04 <smoser> can i action you for that ?

 16:04 <arosales> #action arosales create a overview topic bp for servercloud

 16:04 * meetingology arosales create a overview topic bp for servercloud

 16:05 <smoser> good.

 16:05 * arosales think I also volunteered for that last week, running behind on my todos :-(

 16:05 <smoser> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:05 <smoser> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:06 <smoser> i dont know how relevant that url is at this point in the cycle.

 16:06 <smoser> (in addition to the fact that i posted a -r- url again)

 16:06 <smoser> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-s-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:06 <smoser> #topic Blueprints

 16:07 <smoser> we need some help from here from arosales, so next week we'll have a pretty graph.

 16:07 * arosales will work on that _today_

 16:07 <smoser> ok. so 2 things here.

 16:08 <smoser> a.) if you have expected work for 13.04 that is not covered by a blueprint starting with 'servercloud-s-' at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~davewalker/+specs?role=approver

 16:08 <smoser> then please contact myself or jamespage to help you get on that list.

 16:09 <smoser> b.) if you have something on that list in some state other than 'Approved', then you should make some effort to change that.

 16:09 <smoser> (smoser looks in a mirror and says "I'm talking to you")

 16:09 <smoser> other blueprints in such a state are:

 16:09 <smoser> servercloud-s-cloud-kvm-on-arm: hallyn

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-enterprise-testing: jamespage

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-fastpath-install: smoser

 16:10 * hallyn not sure what that means.

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-interlock: Daviey

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-maas-next-steps: roaksoax

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-openstack-hypervisor: zul

 16:10 <smoser> servercloud-s-openstack-pkg: zul

 16:11 <hallyn> smoser: can you please drop servercloud-s-cloud-kvm-on-arm ?

 16:11 <smoser> one other one for zul and one for smoser.

 16:11 <hallyn> or cani do that, hm

 16:11 <zul> can you drop servercloud-s-oepnstack-pkg: its going to be folded into the main openstck blueprint

 16:12 <smoser> hm..

 16:12 <smoser> ok. we'll figure out what to do on those.

 16:12 <hallyn> thx

 16:12 <hallyn> i marked it deferred for now.

 16:13 <smoser> just put both of them as 'definition: obsolete'

 16:13 <smoser> zul, ^

 16:13 <hallyn> ok

 16:13 <zul> ok cool

 16:13 <smoser> anyone have anything else here?

 16:13 <smoser> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:14 <smoser> anyone have events coming up ?

 16:14 <smoser> ok. i dont. so moving on.

 16:14 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:14 <psivaa> i am in for plars today

 16:15 <psivaa> nothing much from our side

 16:15 <smoser> anyone have questions for psivaa ?

 16:15 <smoser> k. moving on. thanks for coming p

 16:15 <smoser> k. moving on. thanks for coming psivaa

 16:15 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:15 <smb> No kernel specific things to report (some user-space issues, though). Maybe I should remind anybody having kernel problems which I should (or am supposed to) be looking at, to remind me (again) if I have not been active on reports. Are there questions?

 16:16 <smb> smoser, And I likely will try to talk to you about Xen stable (micro) updates and tech-board at some point later...

 16:16 <smb> ...

 16:16 <smoser> i dont have anything for you, smb.

 16:16 <smoser> sometime, sooner than later, daviey or i or someone needs to look at "medium" sized kernel for server

 16:17 <hallyn> smb: do you know if there are any overlayfs work items for kernel?

 16:17 <smoser> (ie, one block net and other important-to-server modules, but not "desktop" like drivers)

 16:17 <smb> hallyn, I thought apw was doing something

 16:17 <hallyn> (there are some (well at least one) open bugs, wondering if fixing them is going to be actively done, or passively waited for)

 16:17 <hallyn> if anyone was i assumed it was him :)

 16:18 <hallyn> just wondering, i can looka round later

 16:18 <smoser> hallyn, you have a list of said bugs ? it would be good to have them collected if nothing else.

 16:18 <smoser> i'd be interested in seeing it.

 16:18 * smoser has been bit by no inotify support

 16:18 <smoser> bug 882147

 16:18 <ubottu> bug 882147 in coreutils (Ubuntu) "overlayfs does not implement inotify interfaces correctly" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/882147

 16:18 <smb> smoser, The medium size package thing, you probably may be successful in replacing current virtual, but there was not much rejoice for having yet another type

 16:18 <hallyn> no not really. and i just deleted the emails

 16:19 <smoser> good thinking on deleting stuff, hallyn :)

 16:19 <smb> never leave paper trail. :)

 16:20 <smoser> smoser, on medium sized, the goal woudl be replace -virtual, but i could see me asking for small medium an large for 13.10, one of which to be dropped for 14.04

 16:20 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:20 <smoser> rbasak, howdy

 16:20 <rbasak> Hi

 16:20 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:21 <rbasak> I'm looking at a golang FTBFS that affects saucy but not sid

 16:21 <smoser> nice.

 16:21 <rbasak> That's about all in the ARM world right now.
