 12:33 <jared> #topic jibel's membership application

 12:33 <jared> As we've discussed as only micahg, IdleOne and I are present we're unable to successfully vote on your applciation as we don't have quorum

 12:34 <jibel> understood

 12:35 <jared> In discussions with the present members we have determined to follow previous precedent and move the vote to the mailing list so we don't hold up the application process

 12:37 <jibel> jared, can you use the @gmail address instead?

 12:37 <jared> jibel: so we'll vote privately on the list to allow open discussion and ensure we ask you any clarification questions we need. The process shouldn't take too long as I believe the US should be waking up soon so that should give use enough members to reach quorum

 12:37 <jared> jibel: surely can

 12:37 <jared> (I was just going down the list on LP - sorry)

 12:38 <jared> So I'm goign to close the meeting now and we'll adjourn to the ML. I'd anticipate having a result within 24 - 48 hours at the outside.

 12:38 <jared> #endmeeting
