 16:33 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:33 <jdstrand> Stefan Bader (smb) provided debdiffs for precise-raring for xen. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Thanks!

 16:33 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:33 <chrisccoulson> hi

 16:33 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:34 <jdstrand> I'm on triage this week

 16:34 <jdstrand> I will finish the preliminary install audit of the phablet image this week

 16:34 <jdstrand> I have some pending updates

 16:35 <jdstrand> and need to review sbeattie's deliverables for the month and plan for getting them finished since he is on holiday

 16:35 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 16:35 <mdeslaur> am currently testing an embargoed issue

 16:35 <mdeslaur> and will write a test for libraw

 16:36 <mdeslaur> will go down the list of updates after that

 16:36 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it

 16:36 <mdeslaur> uh...who's usually after steve... tyhicks?

 16:36 <tyhicks> yep

 16:37 <tyhicks> I'm currently drafting an email to the apparmor list to push the dbus syntax discussions along

 16:37 <tyhicks> I hope that we can come to a decision on that and I can make the parser changes for that this week

 16:38 * sarnold dons asbestos ..

 16:39 <jdstrand> so

 16:39 <jdstrand> with sbeattie out, I wonder if we can actually take a decision

 16:39 <tyhicks> I'll also be going through my todo list of trivial things that needs to be fixed/improved in the dbus and apparmor packages as we get closer to upstreaming those and sticking them in the archive

 16:39 <tyhicks> jdstrand: I expected more people to chime into your question on proposal 3 vs 4

 16:40 <jdstrand> me too :\

 16:40 <tyhicks> jdstrand: but, I feel like there's still a lean towards 3

 16:40 <tyhicks> which is sbeattie's proposal

 16:41 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 16:41 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:41 <jdstrand> because that didn't happen and steve is on vacation, I don't think we can take a decision and complete that work item

 16:41 <jdstrand> wait

 16:41 <tyhicks> ah

 16:41 <tyhicks> sorry

 16:41 <jdstrand> before we get to jjohansen

 16:41 <jdstrand> jjohansen: opinion? ^

 16:42 <jjohansen> jdstrand: well likely not, but we will see how things go. I don't think steve cares so much about 3 vs 4

 16:42 <jdstrand> huh, 4 seems so radically different I would think there would be an opinion

 16:43 <jjohansen> but if we are leaning towards 3 and since it is his proposal modified, maybe

 16:43 <jdstrand> but I don't want to stall out for weeks either

 16:43 <jdstrand> my feeling is that as upstream, we shouldn't take the decision

 16:43 <jjohansen> jdstrand: don't worry I can throw enough fuel on the fire

 16:43 <jdstrand> jjohansen: I'm afraid of said fuel :P

 16:44 <jdstrand> my feeling is that as upstream, we shouldn't take the decision without steve

 16:44 <jdstrand> but, for Ubuntu I think we should revise our stance on pushing a syntax that may change

 16:45 <jjohansen> I think that we will just have to push something that may change

 16:45 <jjohansen> but lets get it to where it likely won't

 16:45 <jdstrand> in others words, let's get as far as we can on the syntax as we can without steve (like tyhicks said), then push that into the archive (or at least the ppa) so that these code bits are in before feature freeze and getting some testing

 16:46 <tyhicks> I think that makes sense

 16:46 <jdstrand> then when he gets back, we can see what he objects to (if anything), then adjust before committing upstream. then after committing to upstream, do another upload to ubuntu

 16:47 <tyhicks> that's reasonable

 16:47 <jdstrand> mdeslaur, jjohansen: what do you think?

 16:48 <jjohansen> jdstrand: I think its the only thing we can reasonable do given the circumstance

 16:48 <mdeslaur> I didn't follow what the issue was, so I have no current opinion

 16:48 <jdstrand> ok, then let's plan on that

 16:48 <jdstrand> tyhicks: thanks

 16:48 <jdstrand> jjohansen: you're up

 16:48 <jjohansen> I'll be working on backporting apparmor for the phablet kernels, an email to push the syntax discussion along (or at least ignite the arguing again), hopefully release 2.8.2 and then back to working ipc

 16:49 <jjohansen> s/working/working on/

 16:49 * jjohansen just wishes it was all working

 16:51 <mdeslaur> \o/ phablet kernels

 16:52 <jjohansen> thats it for me sarnold your up

 16:53 <sarnold> I'm in my happy place this week, though I've got some leftover packages from community to finish: stunnel4 (I want another two manual tests before shipping) and ruby-openid (no idea how to test, asking ckuerst for ideas..)

 16:54 <sarnold> the patch for ruby-openid looked simpled enough, it's probably fine even without a test, but just 'it loads' is a little unsatisfying.

 16:55 <sarnold> I'm looking forward t othrowing rocks at hornets's nests^W^W^W^W the upcoming dbus responses... I'm mostly happy with #3 but want to make sure that we're not missing something better.

 16:55 <sarnold> I'm hopeful for some patch review from jjohansen or tyhicks this week, but if not, I'll pick up an update

 16:56 <sarnold> I think that's it for me; chrisccoulson, you're up :)

 16:56 <chrisccoulson> w00t

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> so, last week we got a flash update, and i did some more work on our chromium API

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> i've scheduled a meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss that btw :)

 16:57 <chrisccoulson> i shall be doing more work on that this week, and we'll likely get chromium published too (yay!)

 16:57 <jdstrand> sarnold: regarding options against #3-- not to worry, I'll be happy to shoot those down too

 16:57 <jdstrand> sarnold: :P (j/k ;)

 16:57 <sarnold> jdstrand: woo :)

 16:58 * jdstrand hugs sarnold

 16:58 <sarnold> chrisccoulson: oh man, that's awesome. :)

 16:58 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: chromium updates! /me rubs his eyes

 16:58 <chrisccoulson> also, i'll get builds for next weeks firefox update before the end of the week

 16:58 * jdstrand hugs chrisccoulson too :)

 16:58 <chrisccoulson> so it's going to be a fun end to the week ;)

 16:58 <chrisccoulson> thanks :)

 16:58 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done
