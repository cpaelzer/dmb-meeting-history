 17:00 <meetingology> Current chairs: YokoZar beuno cprofitt czajkowski pleia2

 17:01 <czajkowski> cheers pleia2

 17:01 <pleia2> so, czajkowski sent an email to the tech board for a catch-up with them (rescheduled due to vUDS conflict), hopefully someone from that will show up in the next few minutes :)

 17:02 <czajkowski> !tb

 17:02 <ubottu> You can contact the technical board via email on technical-board AT lists DOT ubuntu DOT com

 17:02 <pleia2> may have noticed we got a Fix Released on an important bug :) https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1

 17:02 <YokoZar> gee how helpfule

 17:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1 in Ubuntu Malaysia LoCo Team "Microsoft has a majority market share" [Critical,In progress]

 17:03 <czajkowski> cjwatson: kees mdz soren stgraber ping

 17:03 <czajkowski> YokoZar: aye not the most helpful of factoids out there

 17:03 <czajkowski> I know Pitti is away

 17:03 <cjwatson> Um, parallel Debian technical committee meeting which I had forgotten about

 17:03 <cjwatson> I am sort of technically here but not able to pay a great deal of attention

 17:04 <stgraber> lunch break here so on only vaguely around (on my cell phone)

 17:04 <cjwatson> So if somebody else can represent us that would be better

 17:04 <pleia2> it's just a check in, any issues, problems, comments?

 17:04 <pleia2> we can also follow-up via email if there are action items

 17:05 <cjwatson> Guess the only thing I wanted to ask was whether you felt there'd been a significant backlash to the decision to sunset brainstorm.u.c

 17:05 <stgraber> not aware of any specific issue, we've got regular meetings, not a whole lot to discuss typically as we try to process things by e-mail when possible

 17:05 <stgraber> ah yeah, brainstorm

 17:06 <cprofitt> cjwatson: I have seen some folks complain, but not a large amount

 17:06 <pleia2> cjwatson: there have been a couple annoyed responses, but not from people who actually used it (indeed, some actual users agreed)

 17:06 <cjwatson> I think I even saw an admin agree, indeed

 17:06 <pleia2> I think for anyone who is involved it's obvious that wishlist bugs are the appropriate avenue

 17:06 <pleia2> cjwatson: yeah

 17:06 <YokoZar> is the brainstorm code being used anywhere else on the web?

 17:06 <cjwatson> But I was only seeing a very narrow sampling of responses

 17:07 <pleia2> YokoZar: I hope not

 17:07 <pleia2> YokoZar: it's really old and unmaintained, running on old drupal

 17:07 <czajkowski> heh

 17:07 <czajkowski> I think people jump unfortunately to the wrong conculsions at times when things are closed without knowing all the facts and indeed from not even using the item being closed.

 17:08 <pleia2> czajkowski: yeah, "ubuntu shuts down another community feedback mechanism" type comments are all I saw

 17:08 <stgraber> I believe there are other websites based on the ideatorrent code (drupal plugin used by brainstorm) but they're running custom version of some fork of the code and probably have been updated to run on Drupal 7 (instead of Drupal 5)

 17:09 * pleia2 nods

 17:09 <YokoZar> I just edited bug #1

 17:09 <ubottu> bug 1 in Ubuntu Malaysia LoCo Team "Microsoft has a majority market share" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1

 17:09 <YokoZar> I feel like I've abused my power

 17:10 <YokoZar> (namely to link to mark's comment, since bug #1 itself is getting in the news)

 17:16 <pleia2> alright, well I think that's all we had then :)

 17:16 <pleia2> thanks everyone

 17:16 <czajkowski> cheers thanks

 17:16 <pleia2> #endmeeting
