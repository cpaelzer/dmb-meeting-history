 12:27 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 16 April 2025. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:27 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:27:32 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:27 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:28 <mapreri> ty for chairing :)

 12:28 <Wild_Man> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 12:28 <mapreri> missing a piece?

 12:29 <Wild_Man> I do not think so

 12:29 <Wild_Man> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:30 <Wild_Man> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:30 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 12:30 <Wild_Man> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:30 <Wild_Man> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:30 <tea-for-one> Yes, I affirm that I have read and agree to the terms of the Code of Conduct

 12:31 <Wild_Man> Please introduce yourself to the Board Members

 12:32 <tea-for-one> https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/tea-for-one-membership-application/60057

 12:33 <mapreri> ("If I remember correctly, in those far-off days, you couldnâ€™t yet play an mp3 file." - yeah, you needed a non-free piece :>)

 12:34 <tea-for-one> I have been using Ubuntu since 2008. Member of Ubuntu forums from 2008 also. Joined Ubuntu discourse in November 2024. Generally interested in helping with boot, dual-boot problems .

 12:35 <Wild_Man> Please stand by while the board members review the details you've provided, and then I'll invite them to ask any questions they may have

 12:36 <Wild_Man> Any questions for the applicant?

 12:36 <aaron_> Hello tea-for-one, thank you for applying for membership! I see some very high praise from your fellow Ubuntu Forums leaders in your application. I'd love to know what kept you passionate and interested in the community during all those years. As a fellow 7.04 starter, I know it's been a couple of years now :)

 12:36 <mapreri> mhh, the forum today is giving 503?

 12:37 <Wild_Man> Of course it is

 12:39 <Wild_Man> Fortunately I reviewed his applicant earlier while the forum was working plus I have been on the forum since 2008 with him and left a testimonial for him so I know of his contributions first hand

 12:39 <tea-for-one> The thing that kept my interest was, in fact, the thing that may users do not like. I like change, gnome 2 to gnome 3 to unity to gnome 4 to snaps etc

 12:40 <Wild_Man> That is interesting

 12:40 <tea-for-one> Also, the changes in firmware from legacy/msdos to UEFI/gpt

 12:41 <aaron_> The adaptability is commendable!

 12:41 <Wild_Man> Anyone else have any questions?

 12:42 <tea-for-one> In addition,Â  I would never have attempted Virtualisation without reading the posts and info in Ubuntu Forums

 12:43 <Wild_Man> What are your plans for future contributions?

 12:45 <tea-for-one> For the future, I will continue to offer regular assistance in discourse.ubuntu.com. Together with an occasional bug report in Launchpad

 12:46 <Wild_Man> If there are no other questions I am ready to vote

 12:46 <aaron_> Ready to vote as well

 12:49 <aaron_> Congrats tea-for-one and thank you for your dedication and support of the community!

 12:49 <Wild_Man> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them!
