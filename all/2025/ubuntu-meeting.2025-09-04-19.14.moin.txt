 19:14 <soumyadghosh> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 04 September 2025. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 19:14 <meetingology> Meeting started at 19:14:20 UTC.  The chair is soumyadghosh.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 19:14 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 04 September 2025. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 19:14 <soumyadghosh> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 19:18 <soumyadghosh> gjolly Please introduce youself (within 1-5 sentences). And please share the link of your launchpad account and the link of the application at Discourse. The board members will review it accordingly.

 19:19 <gjolly> Hello, I'm gjolly. I'm a software engineer and I started contributed to Ubuntu over the past 4 years. I contributed to packaging, documentation and on various forums. Most of my contributions are technical. I often participate to local community events. Here is my discourse post https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/gauthier-jolly-membership-application/66547

 19:19 <gjolly> Here is my LP page: https://launchpad.net/~gjolly

 19:21 <Bashing-om> gjolly: Short version: Please keep in mind that Ubuntu != Canonical; If as an emplyee should give Membership then there would be no need of employees to apply to the Board. You have your recompense from Canonical, expand on your activities that contribute to the Ubuntu community that we should grant you Membership.

 19:21 <soumyadghosh> Thanks a lot gjolly, for sharing the details. I'd now like to request my fellow members to review their application, and proceed to ask questions one by one.

 19:22 <soumyadghosh> Until then, I‚Äôd like to kindly request anyone who wishes to endorse the applicant to please share their testimonials.

 19:22 <gjolly> @Bashing-om I completely understand. This is why I'm only applying to the Membership 4 years after joining Canonical. At first, I wanted to make sure I had contributed enough to the community before going through this process.

 19:24 <Bashing-om> gjolly: How long have you offered support on AskUbuntu - and why do we not see more on Discourse ?

 19:25 <Wild_Man> What are you plans for future community involvement?

 19:26 <Bashing-om> AaronPrisk: We are just starting - in the questioning phase.

 19:27 <gjolly> I'm been contributing on AskUbuntu for a few years, I didn't make a lot of contributions there neither.

 19:27 <gjolly> I love technical work and sharing my knowledge with others. It's true that most of my contributions are related to packaging and that I could be more present on Discourse.

 19:29 <Wild_Man> It would be awesome to have you contribute some on discourse in the support section it is the official support venue for Ubuntu now

 19:30 <Bashing-om> gjolly: For sure - your packing works do trickle down to the users level :D

 19:30 <Wild_Man> You have made awesome contributions in the technical field at Canonical.

 19:30 <gjolly> @Bashing-om I agree, I will make sure to do that more!

 19:31 <gjolly> @Wild_Man thanks!

 19:33 <gjolly> @Wild_Man being able to contribute to Ubuntu as part of my day job is something I really cherish.

 19:34 <soumyadghosh> @gjolly I was particularly impressed by the API you maintain to query Debian package info ‚Äî that‚Äôs really valuable! üôå

 19:34 <soumyadghosh> I‚Äôm a little unsure, though, whether contributions more related to Azure integrations and documentation should be considered as community contributions, or if they lean more towards company-focused work. Would love to hear others‚Äô thoughts on this distinction.

 19:37 <soumyadghosh> gjolly As per the norms, each Ubuntu Community Membership application should ideally have at least 2 testimonials. I notice there‚Äôs currently only one endorsement ‚Äî is there any specific reason for that?

 19:37 <Bashing-om> gjolly: Documentation - way back when - was what won me over to Ubunntu; before it became so fragmented - how does your efforts on the docs relate at the user level ?

 19:39 <gjolly> soumyadghosh: I just wasn't aware of this, I thought at least one was required.

 19:41 <gjolly> @Bashing-om I'm not sure I understand your question. To me documentation is central to the life of a distro. If a lot of people choose Ubuntu today for AI/ML it's because the documentation of all the ML projects on Gh include a section for Ubuntu.

 19:41 <soumyadghosh> gjolly Would you be able to share a bit about your role at Canonical? It‚Äôll help us better understand how your work there connects (or differs) from your community contributions.

 19:42 <gjolly> @soumyadghosh my team published all the VM images of Ubuntu on the Public Clouds.

 19:43 <gjolly> I am mostly working on Azure but my work frequently covers other Clouds.

 19:45 <gjolly> Understandably, it can be hard to distinguish some of my work between Canonical and Community. But for example, my role officially didn't involve any packaging work.

 19:45 <gjolly> I took the liberty to create a IRC channel #ubuntu-cloud

 19:45 <gjolly> (back when we were on IRC)

 19:46 <soumyadghosh> gjolly I think it would have been helpful if these kinds of details were included more clearly in your membership application itself. That way, it gives a fuller picture of both your role and your community contributions.

 19:46 <gjolly> Most of my contribution to the documentation are of my own initiative (eg the Find Ubuntu on Azure  page that was later done for other clouds).

 19:47 <soumyadghosh> We do understand that, but I am a bit unsure how writing documentation specifically for Azure directly counts as a contribution to the Ubuntu Community. Could you kindly clarify how this connects with Ubuntu community benefit?

 19:49 <gjolly> My work on sev-snp: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-server-documentation/pull/344 while related to some of the stuff we do on Azure, is completely unrelated with my position.

 19:50 <gjolly> soumyadghosh: I want to think that users of Ubuntu are less prone to confusion when it comes to use Ubuntu on the Clouds and thus it will help reduce the amount of support that the community will have to provide.

 19:53 <soumyadghosh> gjolly Thanks a lot for sharing your perspective and clarifying the details. üôè

 19:53 <soumyadghosh> I'd just like to ask one final question before I wrap up my review‚Ä¶

 19:54 <AaronPrisk> Hey gjolly!

 19:54 <AaronPrisk> First - I love the mention of the compiz cube in your application. I have fond memories of showing it off to lure users to our world. :)

 19:54 <AaronPrisk> I see in your work listed that you helped fix a bug with qemu and have interest in contributing more to that virt world. Do you feel there are other platforms either physical or virtual that we should be putting more focus on?

 19:54 <soumyadghosh> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 19:57 <gjolly> @AaronPrisk yeah I would like to see more involvement with newer hypervisor technologies like cloud-hypervisor or firecracker.

 19:57 <AaronPrisk> I was not aware of firecracker! Thanks for sharing! :)

 19:58 <gjolly> @soumyadghosh Yes I do.

 19:59 <mapreri> o/

 20:00 <soumyadghosh> Thank you. I'd now like to request my fellow members to vote on the motion.

 20:00 <mapreri> hold on a sec pls?

 20:00 <mapreri> just a minute should be enough, reading through the irc backlog

 20:00 <soumyadghosh> Sure

 20:02 <mapreri> "I often participate to local community events" is that some local things in Paris?

 20:02 <mapreri> gjolly: I'm not up to speed about any LoCo activity in French/Paris, is there anything running smoothly there?

 20:03 <mapreri> (sorry I joined just now, I think there was a mixup regarding the TZ!)

 20:03 <gjolly> No but I go here every year: https://capitoledulibre.org/ (sorry it's in FR only I believe)

 20:04 <gjolly> I gave a talk two years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxcbBxydq4&t=1474s

 20:04 <mapreri> ic

 20:04 <gjolly> And I have two talks accepted this year.

 20:05 <gjolly> (It's on the WE so it's not work :D)

 20:08 <mapreri> I'm good to vote

 20:12 <Bashing-om> +1 I am persuaded that you do make significant contributions to Ubuntu.

 20:12 <meetingology> +1 I am persuaded that you do make significant contributions to Ubuntu. received from Bashing-om

 20:12 <mapreri> -1 I find that you are on the right track, but just not quite there.  I think I'd like to see some more community recognition before making it formal here.

 20:12 <meetingology> -1 I find that you are on the right track, but just not quite there.  I think I'd like to see some more community recognition before making it formal here. received from mapreri

 20:12 <mapreri> As a note, I love the comment Simon wrote about you asking publicly technical questions, since that's something that personally annoys me A LOT when I realize a cabal of canonical devs discuss things keeping the wider community in the dark when there is no reason for it to be.

 20:12 <Wild_Man> +1

 20:12 <mapreri> soumyadghosh: Wild_Man is not in the #voters

 20:23 <gjolly> Thank you everyone for your time. I understand your points and I will try to be more involved on discourse and with the community in general!

 20:23 <mapreri> (also incidentally, I use Azure for work and plenty of Ubuntu images, so guess I make a lot of use of your paid work :P)
