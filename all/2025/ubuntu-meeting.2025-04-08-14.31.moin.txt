 14:31 <cpaelzer> enough pings, now let things settle for a minute

 14:31 <slyon> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> I assume/hope those views are rather clean these days

 14:31 <cpaelzer> arr, the one left is still server

 14:31 <cpaelzer> on ruby

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I've resolved all the other ones when renan filed the removals

 14:32 <cpaelzer> let me ping him

 14:33 <cpaelzer> sorry - extra delay

 14:33 <sarnold> and will the archive admins sort out linux-realtime as a normal part of their work?

 14:33 <sarnold> or do we need to ask someone to handle this specifically before release?

 14:33 <cpaelzer> the kernel-AAs would

 14:34 <cpaelzer> like in apw and tjaaltonen

 14:34 <joalif> o/

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I passed the Q on ruby-sinatra

 14:35 <cpaelzer> but TBH it will99% just remove the proposed v and be ok for now

 14:35 <cpaelzer> ok stared long enough at this list

 14:35 <cpaelzer> next ...

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:36 <cpaelzer> rust-sequpia we talked alst week

 14:36 <cpaelzer> allo others gone

 14:37 <cpaelzer> because a few othes like highway and jpeg-xl made it comepletely through, jbicha prepared and I fixed the component mismatch

 14:37 <cpaelzer> so this looks good too

 14:37 <sarnold> I'm surprised linuxptp didn't make it through

 14:38 <cpaelzer> didn't see it anywhere recently

 14:38 <cpaelzer> but yeah the team started very strong

 14:38 <cpaelzer> and just had a few open to resolve things

 14:38 <cpaelzer> IIRC

 14:38 <cpaelzer> well, there always is a next release

 14:38 <cpaelzer> BTW update on ruby-sinatra - maybe jbicha can help

 14:38 <cpaelzer> it seems it was synced from Debian on Apr 3rd

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Renan will contact you to sort if this should be cleaned or if there was a reason we didn't see

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:39 <cpaelzer> on the issues, not priority

 14:39 <cpaelzer> looking for volunteers

 14:39 <cpaelzer> feel free to do so if you are bored :-P

 14:39 <cpaelzer> on the PRs

 14:40 <cpaelzer> the state SLO is new'ish and had feedback

 14:40 <cpaelzer> let us vote on that one

 14:40 <cpaelzer> oh no, that was the one without feedback yet

 14:40 <cpaelzer> so let me trigger your awareness

 14:40 <cpaelzer> we have defined how much we want to be able to do as a minimum

 14:40 <cpaelzer> security has their own queue and challenge to handle ti

 14:41 <cpaelzer> hi sarnold on that

 14:41 <cpaelzer> but for the MIR team itself

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we said 1 per week per attendee as the goal - more if we can

 14:41 <cpaelzer> and I thought we could put that down

 14:41 <cpaelzer> for transparency

 14:41 <cpaelzer> This is what I wanted to achieve

 14:41 <cpaelzer> have a look when you have time and let me know what you tihnk

 14:41 <sarnold> we have some words somewhere in this thing about MIRs filed too late needing security director conversation -- we don't currently have a security director :( -- but I wonder if that ought to move to this section?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> yeah to escalate go to security director

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I agree this is essentially your side of the SLO

 14:42 <cpaelzer> let me move it

 14:43 <cpaelzer> also - having none means someone is interim * and that will be the person

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I also see slyon now left some comments

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I'll consuem all of that and maybe we can then get more review and mereg it next week?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:43 <slyon> yep. +1 (modulo some nitpicks)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:44 <cpaelzer> this should be almost as clean as the other queues

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I see rust-hwlib as assigned - which we had the dsicussion on outdated vendored things

 14:44 <cpaelzer> no update since IIRC

 14:44 <cpaelzer> eve4rything else - under control

 14:44 <slyon> pushkarnk finished https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pdfio/+bug/2103648 today, which needs a security review tag. @sarnold

 14:44 <cpaelzer> wow - when did I say that the last time for your queue slyon

 14:44 <cpaelzer> praise-party

 14:45 <slyon> hehe

 14:45 <cpaelzer> and here we go, refilling the queue

 14:45 <cpaelzer> is that a panic 25.10 asap case

 14:45 <cpaelzer> sorry 25.04

 14:45 <cpaelzer> or semi-relaxed 25.10

 14:45 <cpaelzer> we discussed it here so I should remember, but I do not :-/

 14:45 <slyon> yeah. pdfio is 25.10

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ah ok, safe then

 14:45 <cpaelzer> sarnold: tag it!

 14:45 <sarnold> slyon: thanks

 14:46 <slyon> well, thanks to pushkarnk :) I only did the double-checking :)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> also thanks pushkarnk and slyon for doing joint reviews to get pushkarnk fully trained up

 14:46 <cpaelzer> appreciated

 14:46 <pushkarnk> thanks for the great review slyon :)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:46 <sarnold> none here

 14:46 <cpaelzer> wow, all this good feeling. Almost empty queues, reviews done, ... how can we destroy it now?

 14:46 <cpaelzer> none here either

 14:46 <joalif> nothing here

 14:46 <sarnold> https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-6094 pdfio

 14:46 <slyon> nothing

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon

 14:46 <slyon> thx sarnold !

 14:46 <pushkarnk> nothing

 14:46 <mylesjp> nothing from me

 14:47 <slyon> \o/

 14:47 <cpaelzer> the thanks s<tab> was meant to be for sarnold

 14:47 <cpaelzer> hey mylesjp and thanks

 14:47 <cpaelzer> you are busy with the moving openstack anyway I assume

 14:47 <cpaelzer> but in the long run you'll have james job of handling the python-whatever deps of OS

 14:48 <cpaelzer> in case you didn't pick it up ealier - mylesjp is the sucessor of jamespage as representative for the openstack team

 14:48 <sarnold> so much churn

 14:48 <sarnold> such big shoes :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I wonder, do we ahve anyone in AMERICAS to guide him initially as slyon does for pushkarnk?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold:  is there but the security side of the process

 14:49 <mylesjp> I'm out in Vancouver so time zones are a little tricky

 14:49 <cpaelzer> didrocks: joalif: myself ... all EMEA

 14:49 <sarnold> hooray cascadia crew!

 14:49 <mylesjp> \o/

 14:49 <cpaelzer> well, let us bet on the person reading this later ...

 14:49 <cpaelzer> didrocks: if you feel you could towards the latter part of your day help train someone else to do the MIR review work, reach out to mylesjp

 14:50 <cpaelzer> TBH that is it for AOB is it?

 14:50 <sarnold> we're tired, boss

 14:50 <cpaelzer> then get out and fix and relax

 14:50 <sarnold> :D

 14:50 <cpaelzer> let me fetch you some coutndown numbers

 14:50 <mylesjp> I've done quite a few MIRs myself but never reviewed someone elses. I could definitely sit in on one.

 14:51 <cpaelzer> yep, that is how we all started

 14:51 <cpaelzer> as slyon and pushkarnk do

 14:51 <cpaelzer> you'd prep but get double checked for a while

 14:51 <cpaelzer> then you get the spiderman stare at the spring about great power and great responsibility

 14:51 <slyon> mylesjp: could even be async, I guess. Pushkar usually prepares MIR reviews in GDoc, I add my comments before publishing to LP

 14:51 <cpaelzer> and then we'd add you to the LP group and you'd be another eligible to do reviews

 14:51 <mylesjp> sounds great

 14:52 <cpaelzer> ok, look what I found in urandom for ou

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 5

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 4

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 2

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 7
