 14:05:14 <stgraber> #topic Action items review

 14:05:24 <stgraber> xnox to liase with ballons, gema and jibel w.r.t. fs/storage testing

 14:05:42 <stgraber> haven't heard about it and xnox isn't around, so keeping it for next meeting

 14:05:51 <jibel> no news from xnox

 14:05:52 <stgraber> stgraber to review and sponsor bug 977947, bug 977952 and bug 977940

 14:05:57 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 977947 in libbonobo (Ubuntu Precise) "Please transition libbonobo to multi-arch" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/977947

 14:05:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 977952 in libbonoboui (Ubuntu Precise) "Please transition libbonoboui to multi-arch" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/977952

 14:05:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 977940 in gnome-vfs (Ubuntu Precise) "Please transition gnome-vfs to multi-arch" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/977940

 14:06:16 <stgraber> I've been talking to stokachu and asked for a rebuild test of the rdepends (as is required for multi-arch changes)

 14:06:40 <stgraber> I haven't got a status update from him yet... hoping these will be done soon so we can finally upload these

 14:06:52 <stgraber> skaet to poke the SRU team and see what can be done to process the current backlog

 14:07:05 * skaet poked

 14:07:43 <skaet> plan discussed earlier this week,   but couple of steps, rather than immediate reaction.

 14:08:00 <skaet> if there are specific blockers,  please flag in #ubuntu-release

 14:08:44 <skaet> mostly the processing seems to be keeping up (ie. its not getting worse),  verification is issue though.

 14:08:44 <stgraber> stgraber to change the meeting to a weekly meeting

 14:09:22 <stgraber> skaet: I've been trying to help a bit with verification this week. Trying to clear these that area >= 7 days

 14:09:37 <stgraber> I know I've got a bunch more to go through today (that reach their 7 days today)

 14:09:45 <skaet> Thanks stgraber!  :)

 14:09:57 <stgraber> as for the weekly meeting action item, well, as you can see, it's done ;)

 14:10:05 <skaet> :)

 14:10:17 <stgraber> #topic Review of upcoming deadlines

 14:10:39 <NCommander> Sorry, I'm running late. Was OTp'ed

 14:10:47 <skaet> Today is new hardware freeze,  and I think most of the new hardware bits are in place....

 14:10:48 <stgraber> * 2012/08/02: Beginning of PointReleaseProcess and

 14:10:48 <stgraber> DesktopInfrastructureFreeze

 14:10:48 <stgraber> * 2012/08/09: KernelFreeze, LanguageTranslationDeadline, SRU Fix

 14:10:48 <stgraber> Validation Testing

 14:10:48 <stgraber> * 2012/08/16: FinalFreeze, ReleaseNoteFreeze

 14:10:58 <stgraber> * 2012/08/23: Ubuntu 12.04.1

 14:11:06 <NCommander> skaet: right, so base-installer, libd-i, and f-k got uploaded

 14:11:30 <stgraber> skaet: oh right, forgot that one, yeah I believe we were just waiting for highbank and NCommander took care of it

 14:11:33 <NCommander> d-i patch is done and works, but f-k had a bug that didn'tpot untilit was in archive,so I needto do a second upload to fix

 14:12:00 <NCommander> stgraber: its looking like d-i will get uploaded tomorrow dueto the f-k hiccup, but all the code works now,and it passesthe netboot QA test case

 14:12:44 <NCommander> (may get uploaded tonight, depends how many hours of consciousness I can mantain)

 14:13:21 * NCommander is done

 14:13:30 <skaet> stgraber,  also the walinuxagent is available, and gotten in to 12.10,  but needs to be reviewed for 12.04.1 still.

 14:14:08 <stgraber> skaet: do we have a bug targeted to 12.04.1 for it? I don't remember seeing one when I went through the list last time

 14:14:18 <jamespage> stgraber, yep - one second

 14:14:21 <skaet> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent/+bug/1014864

 14:14:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1014864 in walinuxagent (Ubuntu Precise) "[MIR] walinuxagent" [High,New]

 14:15:06 <jamespage> skaet, so we are treating this like hardware enablement?

 14:15:51 <stgraber> are you also planning to have it in main there?

 14:16:06 <skaet> jamespage, its in a grey area,  but that's closest.

 14:16:10 <smoser> yes, main.

 14:16:22 <stgraber> is the security team aware that they'll have to support it for the 12.04 too?

 14:16:44 <jamespage> stgraber, I believe so but I will check

 14:17:00 <stgraber> I don't see it mentioned in the bug, so adding a package to the supported list post-release would probably need to be mentioned to everyone involved :)

 14:17:10 <stgraber> jamespage: ok, thanks

 14:17:24 <stgraber> #topic Quick look through the current bug lists

 14:17:40 <NCommander> (side note: f-k uploaded, just needs a SRU push, and then a publisher run and I can uploadd-i)

 14:17:50 <stgraber> so the list once again doesn't look extremely good. We went from 112 entries up to 121 entries

 14:18:14 <stgraber> that's 90 without the fix commited ones

 14:18:42 <stgraber> and around 75 without the ones currently sitting in the queue

 14:19:18 <stgraber> of these remaining 75, 30 are still without assignees

 14:19:37 <stgraber> mostly desktop and servre bugs

 14:19:41 <stgraber> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.structural_subscriber=&field.milestone%3Alist=49926&field.component-empty-marke

 14:20:33 <stgraber> http://goo.gl/4KgFI in case that link didn't paste properly

 14:21:25 <seb128> I will assign bugs for desktop, though they are mostly on track but I don't usually bother setting the assignee when that's the case

 14:21:53 <stgraber> there was two foundations bug in there (at least), I assigned these two now

 14:22:05 <skaet> getting those with patches attached,  processed quickly would be good as well.   if possible.

 14:22:48 <stgraber> yeah, some of these have been fixed in quantal or have patches attached, so are pretty trivial fixes. I've been pushing a few of these yesterday, will try to spend some more time today for that

 14:24:29 <stgraber> would be good to remind your teammates that they only have roughly two weeks left to get these fixes into -proposed, so it's really time to update the status of these bugs and move these that won't get fixed

 14:26:15 <stgraber> #topic Round table

 14:26:22 <stgraber> stgraber@castiana:~$ echo $(shuf -e NCommander seb128 stgraber jibel skaet smoser jamespage)

 14:26:25 <stgraber> seb128 NCommander jibel smoser stgraber jamespage skaet

 14:26:27 <stgraber> seb128: you're up!

 14:26:47 <seb128> hey

 14:27:02 <seb128> nothing special to say, desktop SRUs still go at a good pace

 14:27:13 <seb128> the unity SRU round is ready from today, should hit the queue soon

 14:27:28 <seb128> it's good to see that we got a good round of SRU reviews some days ago

 14:27:49 <seb128> the second round of compiz,unity SRUs with the performances improvements might be delayed to 12.04.2

 14:27:54 <seb128> if it's getting too late

 14:27:55 <seb128> ..

 14:28:06 <stgraber> NCommander:

 14:28:39 <NCommander> need flash-kernel iushed into proposed so I can do a second d-i install, then upload and finalize the SRU

 14:28:45 * NCommander is lagging, sorry

 14:29:09 <NCommander> Beyond that highbank enablement looks solid

 14:29:13 <NCommander> ..

 14:29:20 <stgraber> jibel:

 14:29:39 <jibel> must investigate  upgrade bug 1022864

 14:29:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1022864 in gsettings-desktop-schemas (Ubuntu Quantal) "Lucid to Precise upgrade test failed: User settings are not preserved on upgrade" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1022864

 14:30:13 <jibel> 1 failure yesterday with precise desktop i386, but was transient and todays looks good

 14:30:15 <jibel> ..

 14:30:58 <stgraber> smoser:

 14:31:14 <smoser> jamespage, volunteered to take my spot

 14:31:19 <jamespage> ta

 14:31:39 <jamespage> still pushing through SRU's for the server packages.

 14:31:58 <jamespage> juju bugs have now been reviewed and we now only have a few outstanding for 12.04.1

 14:32:22 <jamespage> maas - still making decisions on what will be SRU'ed for 12.04.1

 14:32:27 <jamespage> so not much progress there

 14:32:47 <jamespage> as skaet mentioned walinuxagent is required for windows azure enablement in 12.04

 14:32:55 <jamespage> thats getting some focus

 14:33:29 <jamespage> and rbasak has reworked the apache/module multiarch fix; which got uploaded today...

 14:33:31 <jamespage> ..

 14:34:11 <stgraber> yay for apache2/mod_security! that one has been waiting in -proposed for a long time

 14:34:19 <stgraber> stgraber:

 14:34:42 <stgraber> been doing a bunch of verifications in -proposed, more to come today

 14:35:16 <stgraber> Uploaded a new ubiquity with a bunch of fixes, also resolvconf (1 fix), krb5 (1 upgrade fix) and libxslt (multi-arch bug)

 14:35:57 <stgraber> Went through all the foundations related bugs during our team meeting, will continue to do so until the point release, trying to get people to prioritize that work

 14:36:00 <stgraber> ..

 14:36:01 <stgraber> skaet:

 14:36:20 <skaet> Discussed translation plan with David Plannella,  working to make sure coverage during vacations.

 14:36:20 <skaet> 12.04.1 Manifest has been updated, mostly signed off, can be found at:

 14:36:20 <skaet> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseManifest/12.04.1

 14:36:20 <skaet> Daily cron builds will be set up to reflect the signed off manifest and the results will be published on:

 14:36:20 <skaet> #link http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/204/builds

 14:36:22 * skaet started working on it yesterday,  and but wants to get some review before deploying.

 14:36:24 <skaet> Will announce in #ubuntu-release channel when dailies  include all of 12.04.1 manifest targets.

 14:36:26 <skaet> Need to start getting flavors testing their images, and seeing if there are any surprises.

 14:36:42 <skaet> ..

 14:37:12 <stgraber> #topic AOB

 14:37:42 <stgraber> bug 1025515 made the reviews a bit trickier yesterday, but it's been fixed now, so I'm expecting a bunch of SRUs hitting proposed soon

 14:37:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1025515 in Launchpad itself "LP diffs are being linked at http://lplibrarian-private-download.internal:8000" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1025515

 14:38:53 <ScottK> What's the deadline for getting into -proposed?  There's a candidate issue in postfix that I'm considering tackling after the current SRU is copied to -udpates.

 14:40:07 <skaet> 08/02

 14:40:14 <ScottK> Thanks.
