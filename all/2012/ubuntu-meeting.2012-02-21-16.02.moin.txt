 16:02:28 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:31 <zul> oh good not me

 16:02:55 <utlemming> It doesn't look like there is anything to cover from the last meeting

 16:03:01 <utlemming> so we'll move on then

 16:03:13 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Precise Development

 16:03:24 <utlemming> Fearless Leader Daviey, what do you have for us?

 16:03:32 <Daviey> oh, hello

 16:03:49 <Daviey> Firstly, FF was last Thursday.

 16:04:02 <Daviey> Is there any undeclared features people need to land before release?

 16:04:18 <hallyn> define declared?

 16:04:19 <ScottK> There will be a postfix FFe for 2.9.

 16:04:25 <arosales> jamespage: and rbasak are working on openmpi 1.5

 16:04:30 <ScottK> lamont and I have already discussed it.

 16:04:40 <utlemming> I'm working on a cloud-image mirroring script

 16:04:47 <Daviey> ScottK: Oh, great. Anything exciting?

 16:05:03 <adam_g> Daviey: opnenstack introduced a new python dependency over the weekend that is not in main, python-iso8601

 16:05:05 <roaksoax> I'll have to file FFe for cobbler MIR and probably some other packages new upstream's

 16:05:09 <adam_g> (for nova + glance)

 16:05:27 <Daviey> arosales: is openmpi still ging to ship 1.4 and 1.5, or still investigating just switching?

 16:05:36 <Daviey> adam_g: *sigh*

 16:05:41 <jamespage> Daviey: decision on that in the next hour

 16:06:08 <arosales> Daviey: I think jamespage and rbasak were working on updating to 1.5

 16:06:12 <arosales> include the dependencies,

 16:06:26 <Daviey> adam_g: at least it is packaged!

 16:06:26 <Daviey> jamespage: cool

 16:06:28 <Daviey> shall we go through the bug states?

 16:06:35 <Daviey> arosales: cool

 16:06:44 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:06:51 <adam_g> Daviey: its very small, too. <150 LOC

 16:07:05 <Daviey> adam_g: should be simples.. :)

 16:07:10 <Daviey> bug 924739

 16:07:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924739 in squid3 (Ubuntu Precise) "after upgrade from oneiric to precise, previous squid config unused, cannot be used when relocated" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924739

 16:07:29 <Daviey> adam_g: were you looking at that?

 16:07:33 <ScottK> Daviey: usual new release of postfix.  The biggest change is a memcache client.

 16:08:07 <adam_g> Daviey: a bit, but haven't made any progres sinthe last week

 16:08:14 <Daviey> ScottK: well between you, lamont and a reliable upstream.. doesn;t concern too much :)

 16:08:22 * ScottK nods

 16:08:42 <Daviey> adam_g: Are you able to investigate further before next tues?

 16:09:15 <roaksoax> adam_g: do you think a newer upstream of squid with improve things?

 16:09:16 <adam_g> Daviey: i can, but not certain how much progress i can make alone. would love to have help of anyone else interested

 16:09:43 <adam_g> roaksoax: not AFAIK. there are features not-yet ported to squid3 that cause config parsing to fail

 16:09:56 <Daviey> adam_g: Okay, if you drive it - we'll see who else can help.

 16:10:03 <adam_g> Daviey: k

 16:10:07 <Daviey> roaksoax is kinda snowed under right now.

 16:10:24 <roaksoax> adam_g: I can also help with that as I have a bug with the buckets which is supposedly fixed in a new upstream that is in debian unstable atm mand we might have to file FFe

 16:29:41 <Daviey> SpamapS: Yes.

 16:30:22 <utlemming> Daveiy: no update, looks like we won't be fixing it as it is related to disk creation and not the images themselves.

 16:32:35 <adam_g> Daviey: still blocked on the keystone MIR, but needed more now than before

 16:33:08 <Daviey> right

 16:33:08 <Daviey> Blueprints.

 16:33:21 <Daviey> SpamapS: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-automated-boot-testing , everything TODO to be postponed?

 16:34:04 <Daviey> jamespage: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cloud-image-testing same?

 16:34:04 <Daviey> (freecloud item to be postponed for sure, i guess)

 16:34:07 <SpamapS> Daviey: not at all. Its just been slow getting integrated into the test suite because they don't want more development done on it.

 16:35:07 <SpamapS> Daviey: I need to get w/ jamespage and get the changes I already developed added into the testing framework and then those will fall rapidly

 16:35:28 <Daviey> SpamapS: how is juju charm testing doing?

 16:35:56 <jamespage> Daviey: yep - I'll postpone that ietm

 16:36:10 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-juju-charm-testing

 16:36:20 <SpamapS> Daviey: spec seems stalled.. will have to revive it (set it aside for Feature Freeze)

 16:36:34 <Daviey> adam_g: is https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack-charms accurate ?

 16:36:47 <Daviey> SpamapS: cool

 16:37:33 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cfjuju , just postponed puppet items on behalf of lynxman

 16:37:39 <adam_g> Daviey: yes, tho i think POSTPONED'ing 'melange - charm needed if quantum is supported (tech preview)'

 16:37:59 <Daviey> SpamapS: Can you report how juju is shaping up?

 16:38:10 <Daviey> adam_g: make it so :)

 16:38:28 <SpamapS> Lots of bugs fixed. Subordinates are starting to land.

 16:38:55 <SpamapS> Still a giant pile of production limiting bugs.

 16:39:20 <SpamapS> But we will be working on some "real world" testing of juju+precise in the next few weeks.

 16:39:30 <Daviey> great!

 16:39:46 <Daviey> Hopefully they'll be some bitesize bugs everyone can work on :)

 16:39:55 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-ceph

 16:40:05 <Daviey> (being driven by kernel, smb?)

 16:40:14 <Daviey> or SpamapS ?

 16:40:39 <smb> huh?

 16:40:48 <Daviey> hallyn: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-kvm-document-suggested-changes ?

 16:41:18 <Daviey> smb: there seems to be some ceph todo's assigned to the kernel team, are you/they aware?

 16:41:27 <smb> Daviey, no

 16:41:55 <Daviey> smb: rocking :)

 16:42:07 <Daviey> SpamapS: Is it something that can be postponed ?

 16:42:25 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-powernap likely to be postponed?

 16:42:49 <Daviey> SpamapS: and/or https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-glusterfs-mir

 16:42:58 <SpamapS> Daviey: some of the ceph stuff will be postponed yes

 16:43:04 <roaksoax> Daviey: I;m postponing it and propiosing it to GSoC

 16:43:10 <Daviey> roaksoax: cool

 16:43:26 <SpamapS> Daviey: Not sure about glusterfs.

 16:43:30 <Daviey> SpamapS: can you update, and speak to smb about what needs to be done?

 16:43:35 <SpamapS> Daviey: with a LOW priority, its been pushed down a lot.

 16:43:43 <Daviey> SpamapS: lets table glusterfs for the meeting and work otu for next week.

 16:43:46 <Daviey> DONE

 16:43:51 <Daviey> sorry for overunnning..

 16:43:54 <Daviey> utlemming: ?

 16:43:56 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:43:59 <SpamapS> Daviey: I don't think there's anything for the kernel team to do for CEPH .. its more about QA and testing.

 16:44:11 <utlemming> Do we have any team events this week?

 16:44:37 <utlemming> I'll take that as a no...

 16:46:14 <smb> Well right now persuing some issue back in lucid with spinloack

 16:46:29 <hggdh> ..

 16:47:07 <smb> and something else I cannot remember right now

 16:47:26 <smb> (failing a bit on the mutlitasking part :-P)

 16:47:44 <smoser> :)

 16:48:02 * smoser thanks smb for his help

 16:48:25 <Daviey> smb: the kernel has been rock solid for me so far :)

 16:48:25 <Daviey> (best. kernel. ever)

 16:48:54 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Open Discussion

 16:49:20 <utlemming> Any other topics, questions, concerns or general mockings?

 16:50:23 * Daviey mocks soren

 16:50:30 <utlemming> +1

 16:50:36 <SpamapS> huats: care to update us on zentyal briefly?

 16:50:36 * lynxman points to Sorens target audience

 16:50:47 <huats> SpamapS: sure

 16:50:53 <huats> so

 16:51:24 <huats> zentyal packages have been out for a while

 16:51:48 <SpamapS> In a PPA

 16:51:50 <huats> and they ask to be include in universe

 16:52:01 <huats> so there is a massive review of their work

 16:52:13 <huats> since they have change many things

 16:52:21 <huats> and the name of the package

 16:52:29 <huats> which means a NEW process inclusion

 16:52:53 <huats> so

 16:53:12 <huats> I am doing a review on that aspect to help the archive admin that will review the packages

 16:53:15 <SpamapS> Baically, bug 928501 needs to be fixed.. but that involves *19* NEW packages

 16:53:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 928501 in ebox (Ubuntu) "Precise will ship totally broken ebox packages" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/928501

 16:53:30 <huats> (this is what we have defined with SpamapS)

 16:53:45 <huats> the thing is that the upstream is also doing the packaging

 16:53:51 <huats> and they are really eager to help

 16:53:53 <SpamapS> so huats is going to do a preliminary review looking at what the AA's will look at .. so that there isn't a cycle of review and rejection

 16:54:38 <SpamapS> I'll upload the packages (and review as well) once huats has taken a look and gotten some feedback to the Zentyal devs

 16:54:41 <huats> I should be able to give a first review by tomorrow

 16:54:51 <SpamapS> Anyway, thats all

 16:54:56 <huats> :)

 16:54:56 <SpamapS> huats: right?

 16:55:00 <SpamapS> huats: THANK YOU!

 16:55:04 <huats> thanks for the clarification :)

 16:55:24 <huats> that is it :)

 16:55:49 <utlemming> And with that, we'll yield back the balance of the time.
