 15:05:33 <infinity> - AA and SRU things, including a full round of kernel SRUs

 15:05:34 <infinity> - Uploaded eglibc to both quantal and precise with several fixes, including sorting AVX/FMA4 detection issues

 15:05:36 <infinity> - Updated tzdata in all releases

 15:05:39 <infinity> - Started poking at livefs-in-soyuz things

 15:05:41 <infinity> [..]

 15:05:56 <jodh> * boot/upstart:

 15:05:56 <jodh> - Discussion with slangasek re ConfSource handling.

 15:05:56 <jodh> - Stateful re-exec now working in a rudimentary fashion.

 15:05:56 <jodh> - Attempting to make code work with json-c 0.9 problematic in that it

 15:05:59 <jodh> won't work on 64-bit systems without some trickery. Current feeling

 15:06:02 <jodh> is to mandate json-c 0.10. Upstream Debian maintainer for libjson0

 15:06:05 <jodh> package is planning to work on this, but I'll remind him.

 15:06:08 <jodh> - Currently trying to identify why post re-exec events do not trigger

 15:06:12 <jodh> jobs (may be due to the way I've had to disable D-Bus connection

 15:06:15 <jodh> handling, but still investigating).

 15:06:18 <jodh> ê§ídd

 15:06:21 <jodh> 

 15:07:05 <slangasek> phoenician‚ÄΩ

 15:07:21 <jodh> slangasek: impressed, yes! ;)

 15:07:31 <stokachu> infinity: thanks for the tzdata

 15:08:32 <infinity> stokachu: Did you have a chance to look at the tarball and/or docs I did for you to let me know if the process all made sense to you?

 15:08:45 <stokachu> infinity: yea im reading them this morning

 15:09:22 <slangasek> stgraber: why don't you go ahead of me

 15:09:29 <stokachu> infinity: i wasn't aware of uupdate

 15:09:32 <stgraber> sure

 15:09:41 <stgraber> - 12.04.1

 15:09:41 <stgraber> - 12.04.1 team meeting and minutes

 15:09:41 <stgraber> - Went through all the targeted/milestoned bugs for 12.04.1, updated status based on comments and queue status.

 15:09:44 <stgraber> - Verified a bunch of SRUs.

 15:09:47 <stgraber> - Continuing release process.

 15:09:49 <stgraber> - Fixed 10.04 to 12.04 upgrades using media only. Looking at a few more issues and regressions caused by this.

 15:09:52 <stgraber> - Done reviews and granted exceptions where reasonable. Uploaded a libxml-sax-perl fix and fixed edubuntu-artwork too.

 15:09:55 <stgraber> - Other

 15:09:58 <stgraber> - Implemented package list for all flavours to be used for the supported flag: http://people.canonical.com/~stgraber/supported-packages/lists/

 15:10:01 <stgraber> - Implemented upload permissions report for the DMB at: http://people.canonical.com/~stgraber/permissions/

 15:10:04 <stgraber> - Talked with Ted about image based system

 15:10:06 <stgraber> - Merge partman-iscsi

 15:10:09 <stgraber> - Some ARB app review, the app showdown made the ARB New queue reach 140 packages... Still 50 to review...

 15:10:12 <stgraber> - TODO this week

 15:10:15 <stgraber> - Continue the work on 12.04.1.

 15:10:17 <stgraber> (DONE)

 15:11:11 <xnox> slangasek? or stokachu? or me?

 15:11:30 <slangasek> I'll go next, one sec :)

 15:12:46 <slangasek> * had surgery, so was technically off work yesterday

 15:12:46 <slangasek> * working with jodh around upstart stateful re-exec

 15:12:46 <slangasek> * sponsored upload of kexec-tools so it works with our current vmcoreinfo-less packages

 15:12:49 <slangasek> * lots of SRU processing for .1

 15:12:49 <slangasek> (done)

 15:12:51 <slangasek> * diving into various errors.u.c reports to identify any point-release regressions

 15:13:11 <stokachu> worked with support to get kexec-tools sru in shape and uploaded, failed attempt at getting tzdata in proper form for inclusion which resulted in more documentation added to the wiki which clarifies the process, still drowned in an increase in issues through customer channels, finalizing appmenu-gtk for multi-arch. done.

 15:13:43 <stokachu> infinity: the documentation makes sense and clarifies a lot for me, thanks for doing that

 15:14:23 <infinity> stokachu: NP.

 15:14:30 <slangasek> jodh: given the json-c maintainer's radio silence, please go ahead with preparing the packaging for 0.10 and we can propose a debdiff to Debian when it's ready

 15:14:49 <jodh> slangasek: roger! :)

 15:15:04 <infinity> stokachu: As stated before, I don't mind taking ownership of tzdata ANYWAY, but perhaps you should do 2012f when it comes out, to make sure the docs and knowlege transfer stick, should you need to do it in a hurry sometime,.

 15:15:21 <stokachu> infinity: ok will do

 15:15:42 <xnox> * Catch up on merges:

 15:17:58 <bdmurray> done

 15:17:59 <ev> bdmurray: thanks for the patches!

 15:18:10 <ev> - Fixed bugs that cropped up in the new errors.ubuntu.com, and ones that the

 15:18:10 <ev> increased attention to it surfaced.

 15:18:10 <ev> - Set the y-axis to 0 to fix deceptive graphs.

 15:18:10 <ev> - Correctly escape the problem identifiers so that failed-to-retrace

 15:18:10 <ev> problem pages do not raise an exception.

 15:18:11 <ev> - Fix the month view of the most common problems page (grumbles about UTF8).

 15:18:20 <ev> - Had a conversation with Colin and the Launchpad team about how to best talk

 15:18:20 <ev> to and cache data from Launchpad for our "ideal line" calculation. The ideal

 15:18:20 <ev> line is the number of crashes where all the packages in the dependency

 15:18:20 <ev> chain for the crashed application were up to date at the time of sending,

 15:18:20 <ev> divided by the number of unique users seen in a 90 day period. A few

 15:18:21 <ev> strategies were discussed, but Robert suggested first getting this

 15:18:21 <ev> talking to Launchpad and then seeing just how much extra work needs to be

 15:18:22 <ev> done to speed it up.

 15:18:26 <ev> - Had conversations with Matthew, Robert, and others over whether our ideal

 15:18:26 <ev> line calcuation is correct. Matthew is going to take this to canonical-tech

 15:18:26 <ev> for further discussion, but for the moment we're dropping the ideal line

 15:18:26 <ev> calculation as designed above.

 15:18:32 <ev> - Wrote a script to back-populate system identifiers (SHA-512 hashes of the

 15:18:32 <ev> system uuid) into the individual error reports in the database. These

 15:18:33 <ev> existed in a separate column family that mapped from system identifier to

 15:18:33 <ev> error reports for that system (so we can have a dialog in

 15:18:33 <ev> gnome-control-center that lists your crashes), but we need the reverse

 15:18:33 <ev> mapping for this "90 days of unique users" calculation. It took about 12

 15:18:33 <ev> hours to complete running from my laptop through an ssh tunnel into the DC.

 15:18:34 <ev> 

 15:18:40 <ev> There is an exponentially increasing number of such tasks. I think we're

 15:18:41 <ev> going to need Hadoop and its map/reduce goodness wired to Cassandra much

 15:18:41 <ev> sooner than I originally thought. I'll ask webops to tackle that after we're

 15:18:41 <ev> done with the staging Cassandra database.

 15:18:41 <ev> - Wrote another script to back-populate unique user counts on a per-release

 15:18:41 <ev> basis. This ended up hitting Cassandra too hard and had to be killed.

 15:18:41 <ev> Retuned and run through to completion.

 15:18:52 <ev> - Modified oops-repository to start recording unique user counts on a

 15:18:52 <ev> per-release basis (so we don't have to keep back-populating). Filed RT 55227

 15:18:52 <ev> for this. Deployed.

 15:18:52 <ev> - Chat with Brian over some errors.ubuntu.com mysteries, specifically why

 15:18:52 <ev> we're missing the DistroRelease field for a sizeable set of crashes. Talked

 15:18:53 <ev> to Tom about getting him read-only access to Cassandra, but they're keen on

 15:18:53 <ev> getting the staging DB done first. Re-raised and filed RT 55226 at Tom's

 15:18:54 <ev> request to discuss possible solutions.

 15:19:01 <ev> - Got caught up on Daisy and Errors bug triage.

 15:19:01 <ev> - Ported my branch to use data from Launchpad to colorize the rows from

 15:19:01 <ev> launchpadlib (not threadsafe) to straight HTTP. Merged into trunk and wired

 15:19:01 <ev> it to jml's wonderful AtomicFileCache, which needed a new release of

 15:19:01 <ev> lazr.restfulclient and some small changes to build in lucid.

 15:19:02 <ev> 

 15:19:02 <slangasek> doko: fuse turns the power off?  surely this is evidence that userland filesystems are a bad idea

 15:19:12 <ev> With this branch in place, lines in the most common problems table are

 15:19:12 <ev> greyed out if the linked bug is marked as completed. If the 'Last seen'

 15:19:12 <ev> version is older than the most recent published version, that column will be

 15:19:12 <ev> greyed out. If a linked bug is marked as complete but the 'Last seen'

 15:19:12 <ev> version is the newest version, that column will be marked red (potential

 15:19:13 <ev> regression). This needs some work. Complete includes the Invalid status and

 15:19:13 <ev> the code currently requires all linked bug tasks to be complete for its own

 15:19:14 <ev> interpretation of the complete state.

 15:19:22 <ev> - Fix to whitelist the retracer APIs in open ID. We now have:

 15:19:23 <ev> https://errors.ubuntu.com/retracers-results/

 15:19:23 <ev> https://errors.ubuntu.com/retracers-average-processing-time/

 15:19:23 <ev> - Chat with Andy on the correct algorithm for kernel oops signature

 15:19:23 <ev> generation. I'm going to cook something up and then feed it lots of data

 15:19:23 <ev> from launchpadlib, then ask him to review. The signature generation is the

 15:19:23 <ev> main thing blocking kernel oops reports on http://errors.ubuntu.com.

 15:19:33 <ev> - Chat with Michael Hall, who has been asked by Jono to get bug reports

 15:19:33 <ev> enabled for packages in extras.ubuntu.com. Fixing apport should be fairly

 15:19:33 <ev> straightforward:

 15:19:33 <ev> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/1036224

 15:19:33 <ev> - Fighting juju and Canonistack. Finally got just the latter working and a

 15:19:33 <ev> Cassandra test environment built.

 15:19:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1036224 in apport (Ubuntu) "Whitelist extras.ubuntu.com in apport's native-origins" [Medium,Confirmed]

 15:19:42 <ev> - Wrote a script to populate the test Cassandra DB with sample data, then test

 15:19:42 <ev> the performance and load of the unique users by release back population

 15:19:42 <ev> code.

 15:19:42 <ev> - Improved logging in our retracers and finally fixed retracing of 12.04

 15:19:42 <ev> crashes \0/. This turned out to be oneiric sources in the apt configuration

 15:19:43 <ev> for apport-retrace. Worked a fix through with webops.

 15:19:43 <ev> - Started building out operational graphs. I've made one for instances over

 15:19:44 <ev> time, and will shortly add another for problems over time.

 15:19:54 <ev> - Mail announcing my intent to send a regular posting of the state of the

 15:19:55 <ev> Error Tracker project. It is my hope that this will encourage contributions

 15:19:55 <ev> and keep people like Brian in sync with the conversations we're having in

 15:19:55 <ev> Bluefin.

 15:19:55 <ev> - Investigated the current state of Cassandra-backed Django data models in

 15:19:55 <ev> support of RT 55322. We'll have to use sqlite for this openid stuff.

 15:19:57 <doko> ev: summary, not a short story ;-P

 15:20:13 <ev> - Started integration django-openid-auth into lp:errors. Just need to sort out

 15:20:13 <ev> how to force specific groups via the OpenID AX extension.

 15:27:54 <slangasek> ok

 15:27:59 <slangasek> any more questions on status?

 15:28:37 <slangasek> btw, thanks to everyone who's keeping up on their patch piloting

 15:29:30 <slangasek> it's really nice to see the queue being held down, and I know it's satisfying for our contributors to be getting feedback on their submissions

 15:29:39 <slangasek> so keep up the good work :)

 15:30:12 <slangasek> #topic 12.04.1

 15:30:37 <slangasek> there are a couple of bugs of note on this topic

 15:30:49 <slangasek> one is the nspr issue... bug #1036794

 15:30:51 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1036794 in nspr (Ubuntu Precise) "unmet dependencies during update of nspr4: libnspr4 : Breaks: evolution-plugins (< 3.2.0-0ubuntu2) but 2.32.2-0ubuntu7 is to be installed" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1036794

 15:31:06 <slangasek> I don't know that we need to discuss it here though, I think infinity, stgraber and I can shake that out on #ubuntu-release after the meeting

 15:31:19 <slangasek> the other one is the lucid->precise pre-depends issue

 15:31:28 <slangasek> jibel found us a reproducer for this (thanks, jibel!)

 15:31:42 <slangasek> bug #1017001

 15:31:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017001 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "package resolvconf 1.63ubuntu14 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: pre-dependency problem - not installing resolvconf" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017001

 15:31:56 <stgraber> yeah, I'm poking at 1036794 at the moment, so we can probably just discuss in #ubuntu-release

 15:32:11 <slangasek> can I get a volunteer to look at 1017001 and try to pin it down?

 15:32:33 <slangasek> (very VMable... the reproducer is in the bug description now)

 15:32:45 <infinity> Just a pre-dep ordering issue?

 15:32:49 <infinity> I can poke it.

 15:33:11 <slangasek> a pre-dep ordering issue that has been latent since release and we haven't been able to reproduce, yes :)

 15:33:21 <slangasek> infinity: ok, assigning to you

 15:33:23 <infinity> Yes, but with a reproducer, yay.

 15:33:35 <slangasek> thanks

 15:33:45 <slangasek> stgraber: anything else for 12.04.1 that bears mentioning?

 15:33:48 <ev> xnox: I realised I was somewhat wrong. The way we're calculating the ideal line is wrong. Matthew has some proposed math for it that he's going to send to canonical-tech.

 15:34:04 <ev> so it may be some time before the line comes back

 15:34:21 <slangasek> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+bugs?field.milestone=49926 still shows a number of non-fix-committed bugs; I imagine we need to start bumping milestones?

 15:34:39 <stgraber> yeah, I have an action to do the mass bumping to 12.04.2 for these

 15:34:42 * xnox did ev just finished reading his own novel...? =)

 15:34:48 <ev> ha ha ha

 15:35:09 <ev> I write it throughout the week. I can't be expected to remember every detail ;)

 15:35:21 <stgraber> besides that, we're mostly at the reviewing the queue, accepting stuff and monitoring new bugs part of the process

 15:35:28 <slangasek> stgraber: ok.  Any in that list that you think *shouldn't* be bumped, and we should be trying to get a last-minute upload for instead?

 15:35:39 <stgraber> I don't believe we have anything besides the apt stuff that we might want to see uploaded and included

 15:36:04 <slangasek> the usb-creator one is marked 'fix committed' but was verification-failed, I think

 15:36:16 <slangasek> stgraber: which apt stuff?

 15:36:18 * infinity has someone verifying the FMA4/AVX stuff on his affected hardware right now, in hopes that we can re-open that discussion.

 15:36:24 <stgraber> slangasek: bug 1017001

 15:36:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017001 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "package resolvconf 1.63ubuntu14 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: pre-dependency problem - not installing resolvconf" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017001

 15:36:27 <slangasek> ok

 15:36:36 <slangasek> (which is hopefully not actually an apt bug, but we'll see :)

 15:37:00 <infinity> slangasek: It may well be an apt misfeature, but fixing it in metadata's almost certainly going to be saner for an SRU.

 15:37:03 <infinity> (We'll see)

 15:37:05 <stgraber> slangasek: the fix for usb-creator was indeed marked verification-failed. But I don't think it's critical enough for a last minute fix + upload so I didn't spend more time trying to fix it yet

 15:37:34 <infinity> slangasek: Also, where's the reproducer you claim jibel found for that bug?  The last few comments in the log are people still claiming they can't reproduce. :P

 15:37:49 <slangasek> stgraber: ok, so I guess you'll be bumping the milestone on that one

 15:37:59 <slangasek> infinity: it's in the bug description

 15:38:03 <infinity> slangasek: Oh, he updated the des... Yeah.

 15:38:05 <infinity> Who reads those?

 15:38:06 <slangasek> :)

 15:38:15 <stgraber> slangasek: yeah

 15:38:18 <slangasek> infinity: people who read my comments on IRC telling them to read them? ;)

 15:38:32 <infinity> slangasek: I did all my reading for the day with ev's report.

 15:38:50 <slangasek> #topic Bugs

 15:38:52 <ev> hahaha

 15:39:28 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything you want to highlight?

 15:40:01 <bdmurray> bug 1027648 is ridiculously high on errors.ubuntu.com

 15:40:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1027648 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Quantal) "ubiquity crashed with ValueError in command(): I/O operation on closed file." [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1027648

 15:41:18 <infinity> bdmurray: Does this apply to precise, too?  Comments suggest that it might...

 15:41:26 <slangasek> infinity: it's on the errors.u.c for 12.04, so yes

 15:41:30 * slangasek targets

 15:41:33 <infinity> Check.

 15:42:36 * infinity wonders if there's an obvious linear reproducer, or if it's a race.

 15:42:54 <bdmurray> https://errors.ubuntu.com/bucket/?id=%2Fusr%2Flib%2Fubiquity%2Fbin%2Fubiquity%3AValueError%3Awatch_debconf_fd_helper%3Aprocess_input%3Await%3Acleanup%3Apreseed%3A%3Clambda%3E%3Acommand that's the error report url

 15:43:00 <slangasek> anyone (other than infinity who's already volunteered today) want to look into that one?

 15:43:12 <bdmurray> and there are reports from 2.10.19

 15:43:27 <infinity> xnox loves python and ubiquity.

 15:44:05 <ev> and debconf

 15:44:08 <ev> everyone loves debconf

 15:44:26 <infinity> I have nothing against debconf.

 15:44:32 <ev> I have everything against debconf

 15:44:39 <slangasek> infinity: that's because you don't work on partman ;)

 15:44:53 <infinity> It's people abusively wrapping debconf and getting lost in a twisty maze of file descriptors that I have issues with. ;)

 15:45:01 <ev> lol

 15:45:03 <slangasek> heh

 15:45:05 <bdmurray> then there is also bug 875879 which is trending up on errors.ubuntu.com

 15:45:06 <ev> touch√©

 15:45:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 875879 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager crashed with AttributeError in show_diff(): 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/875879

 15:45:17 <ev> woo, errors.ubuntu.com

 15:45:19 <bdmurray> https://errors.ubuntu.com/bucket/?id=/usr/bin/update-manager:AttributeError:_on_config_file_conflict:run:show_diff

 15:45:48 <bdmurray> looks like it is really an aptdaemon issue

 15:46:15 <slangasek> so based on what that bug is, I think we'll see it trending down again soon

 15:46:38 <slangasek> it triggers only when there's an update that includes a conffile that the user has modified locally

 15:46:51 <slangasek> and the current spike is probably related to some specific SRU that's just gone in

 15:47:22 <slangasek> that doesn't make it less important to fix - quite the contrary.  I'm just saying that it's probably going to fall off errors.u.c and we shouldn't let it fall off our priority list

 15:47:49 <bdmurray> right

 15:48:45 <slangasek> any volunteers for that one?  (if not I think we keep it in the queue for now)

 15:50:02 <slangasek> no volunteers then

 15:50:13 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything else?

 15:50:46 <bdmurray> looking at ubuntu-release-upgrader bugs I see a few crashed with SIGABRT in __assert_fail_base() bug reports

 15:50:54 <bdmurray> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bugs?orderby=-id&start=0

 15:51:21 <bdmurray> I don't know what that is about‚Ä¶

 15:51:32 <slangasek> hmm

 15:52:04 <slangasek> and do-partial-upgrade is in python?

 15:52:33 * slangasek confirms

 15:53:10 <slangasek> bdmurray: do they all show xcb in the stack trace, like bug #1031400 does?

 15:53:11 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 1031400 could not be found

 15:54:45 <slangasek> bdmurray: seems to be a strange X error.  Maybe ask the desktop team?

 15:54:52 <bdmurray> great

 15:55:10 <bdmurray> its probably the same xcb error that was in update-manager

 15:55:32 <slangasek> ah.  did that get tracked down?

 15:55:47 <bdmurray> looking but I don' t hink so

 15:55:57 <slangasek> ok

 15:56:09 <slangasek> stokachu: any bugs from your side that you want us to know about?

 15:56:33 <bdmurray> bug 930839 for the record

 15:56:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930839 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager crashed with SIGABRT in __assert_fail_base(): Assertion !xcb_xlib_unknown_req_in_deq failed in dequeue_pending_request" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930839

 15:57:16 <slangasek> yep, that looks very similar

 15:57:40 <bdmurray> ev is there a way to find a problem linked to that bug on errors?

 15:58:07 <stokachu> slangasek: tzdata and kexec-tools were taken care of so im good

 15:58:10 <ev> bdmurray: not at present, no

 15:58:18 <ev> we don't have a mapping in that direction

 15:58:34 <slangasek> stokachu: ok cool

 15:58:39 <stokachu> ill have appmenu-gtk done soon but ill ping after meeting

 15:59:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: ah, looks like there's been some analysis on 930839.  The next thing to check is whether we're calling the gdk thread init function from these apps

 15:59:51 <slangasek> #topic AOB

 15:59:59 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:00:13 <infinity> Bacon.

 16:00:34 <stokachu> im friends with beggin strips on facebook

 16:00:36 <ogra_> & eggs ?

 16:00:40 <stokachu> love that dog

 16:00:43 <stgraber> slangasek: bug 1037001

 16:00:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1037001 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[l10n][zh_CN] Indicator menus should be fully localized for installer" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1037001

 16:00:51 <stgraber> just mentioned by seb in #ubuntu-devel

 16:01:03 <stgraber> I highly doubt we can do something about it for the point release though

 16:01:54 <slangasek> stgraber: hrrm.  Well, please target it to precise, at least, so it stays on the radar
