 12:04:02 <cyphermox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for July 25, 2012. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:04:14 <cyphermox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04:25 <cyphermox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04:34 <cyphermox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:04:48 <cyphermox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:04:59 <cyphermox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:07:00 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: please introduce yourself :)

 12:08:32 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: you around?

 12:11:53 <head_victim> Hmm appears absent

 12:12:05 <cyphermox> yup

 12:12:10 <Destine> any other applicant?

 12:12:14 <cyphermox> s9iper1 doesn't appear to be on either, sadly

 12:12:45 <smartboyhw> Hi

 12:12:51 <smartboyhw> Sorry, can't get it work

 12:12:58 <head_victim> Working now :)

 12:13:20 <smartboyhw> I'm a Ubuntu tester, helped in Alpha 2 and Daily Builds, I'm a real advanced user of Ubuntu, so Hello

 12:13:23 <Destine> smartboyhw, good, nice to meet you.

 12:13:48 <smartboyhw> When I mean Alpha 2 builds I mean 12.10

 12:14:11 <Destine> smartboyhw, yes, please go on.

 12:14:22 <smartboyhw> What should I say, then

 12:14:37 <smartboyhw> I am really looking forward to help the Ubuntu community

 12:14:48 <smartboyhw> Testing new builds and get the ISO's free of bugs

 12:15:43 <head_victim> smartboyhw: so my first question, how long have you been testing Ubuntu for and what aspect of testing have your contributed to?

 12:16:15 <head_victim> Your LP profile doesn't show a lot of bug activity so curious to learn more about testing

 12:16:22 <smartboyhw> I've been testing it since the first builds of 12.10 and I test about ISOs

 12:16:30 <smartboyhw> Try to see if there's any bug

 12:16:41 <smartboyhw> In the ISO QA Tracker

 12:17:14 <smartboyhw> I can provide a email that proves I

 12:17:27 <Destine> smartboyhw, i don't really see any bugs you reported through LP.

 12:17:37 <smartboyhw> The problem is, I don't find any bugs

 12:17:49 <smartboyhw> Strange, but I always got it no problem

 12:18:26 <Destine> smartboyhw, so despite the testing, what else do you do to contribute?

 12:18:40 <smartboyhw> I translated a few lines for Ubuntu

 12:18:46 <smartboyhw> Got some Karma

 12:18:57 <smartboyhw> In Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong)

 12:19:57 <head_victim> smartboyhw: is there anyone in the testing community that can vouch for your "significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu" as required by the membership application?

 12:20:38 <smartboyhw> Here I don't know, but Nicholas Skaggs, the leader of ubuntu iso testing, ca n prove

 12:20:47 <smartboyhw> I have an e-mail

 12:20:51 <smartboyhw> Want that?

 12:21:42 <Destine> smartboyhw, can you please invite him here?

 12:21:56 <cyphermox> balloons: ?

 12:21:57 <cyphermox> ^

 12:22:07 <smartboyhw> Er, I don't know, I need to send an e-mail

 12:22:17 <smartboyhw> Which he may not see till sometime

 12:23:23 <smartboyhw> Maybe I really should send the email that proved I've contributed in the ISO testing of 12.10 Alpha 2

 12:23:29 <smartboyhw> To you guys

 12:24:20 <Destine> smartboyhw, we lookd for sustained contributions, no single email can prove that.

 12:24:36 <head_victim> smartboyhw: the problem we have is without being involved in QA ourselves we have no way to judge your contribution. We're thinking we should ask you to reapply next month with some signed testimonials of other QA testors that could state your level and length of involvement.

 12:24:53 <smartboyhw> WHAT???

 12:25:00 <Pendulum> smartboyhw: as a guideline, we generally look for a minimum 6 month involvement

 12:25:14 <Pendulum> smartboyhw: why do you want to be an Ubuntu member?

 12:25:26 <smartboyhw> I want to contribute more to the community

 12:25:29 <smartboyhw> Helping out

 12:25:46 <Destine> smartboyhw, ubuntu member is a reward.

 12:25:51 <smartboyhw> And I really wish to be a good Ubuntu comtributor

 12:25:53 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: What we're looking for is really *sustained and significant* contribution to Ubuntu; which is given as a kind of recognition of having done things in the community; you don't need it to contribute :)

 12:25:55 <head_victim> smartboyhw: Ubuntu membership is recognition of significant and sustained contributions, it's not permission to contribute. The contribution comes first.

 12:26:04 <smartboyhw> I know that is a reward

 12:26:19 <Destine> smartboyhw, to those who have already contributed enough.

 12:26:41 <smartboyhw> I think I had

 12:27:24 <Destine> smartboyhw, you did contribute, but not enough.

 12:27:29 <smartboyhw> Why?

 12:27:38 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: we think you should come back once you've done a bit more; and it would help a lot if you also had people who can vouch for what you

 12:27:41 <cyphermox> you've done

 12:28:04 <cyphermox> also, have you spoken and gotten involved with a LoCo team in your location?

 12:28:21 <smartboyhw> I have applied to join, but I think the team's dead

 12:28:26 <Pendulum> smartboyhw: we think you're doing good contributions, but you haven't being doing work for a sustained time period. We also look for testimonials from people you've worked with.

 12:28:27 <cyphermox> fair enough

 12:28:34 <smartboyhw> The HongKong LoCo Team

 12:28:59 <cyphermox> smartboyhw: reviving the team is one of the things you might want to try.

 12:29:17 <smartboyhw> Yeah, but I didn't get apporval to join from the leader

 12:29:21 <smartboyhw> So I can't revive

 12:29:25 <smartboyhw> I want to, but....

 12:29:44 <smartboyhw> The team leader didn't reply

 12:29:58 <Destine> smartboyhw, you might want to contact other members in the LoCo.

 12:29:58 <smartboyhw> Requested to join in Launchpad

 12:30:12 <cyphermox> I see

 12:30:37 <smartboyhw> Poor me, I'm crying now

 12:30:50 <smartboyhw> No one to support me, no Loco Team

 12:30:50 <cyphermox> have you only done the request to join or have you also sent an email, they might have missed the launchpad email

 12:30:59 <Pendulum> smartboyhw: if you really can't find the people who are already members of the LoCo, you may want to talk to the LoCo Council to see if they can help you at all.

 12:31:21 <smartboyhw> Okay, thanks

 12:31:27 <cyphermox> it's all good -- we appreciate the work you've done; we just think you should keep doing more and come back in a little while

 12:31:40 <smartboyhw> The question: How little while?

 12:31:57 <Destine> smartboyhw, maybe you can send me a email, i happen to know people who are involved in HK.

 12:32:10 <smartboyhw> What's your e-mail?

 12:32:41 <cyphermox> it depends. keep working on ISO testing for the release, then after release may be a good time; for instance if other iso testers or Nicholas can vouch for the work.

 12:33:17 <smartboyhw> Yeah, I'll be back after Final release

 12:33:26 <smartboyhw> Wait for me

 12:33:45 <smartboyhw> I failed

 12:34:01 <cyphermox> just don't hesitate to contribute where you can; iso testing isn't necessarily the only thing you may want to touch :)

 12:34:08 <Destine> smartboyhw, you are always welcome.

 12:34:24 <cyphermox> asking for help and asking people to write testimonials on your wiki page is always good, too

 12:34:50 <smartboyhw> Yeah, if Nicholas didn't get me a testimonial, I'll be dead

 12:34:55 <head_victim> smartboyhw: I had a bit of alook around, you might be able to join in with some locals - http://ubuntu.opensource.hk/

 12:35:05 <cyphermox> We still don't have any other applicants online, so let's wrap this up.
