 10:12:04 <lifeless> oscalation isn't in th echannel either

 10:12:11 <Destine> jaddi27, please briefly introduce yourself.

 10:12:18 <lifeless> not bodman456

 10:13:13 <elky> lifeless, if you're editing, aiui oscalation was refused last time

 10:13:21 <lifeless> elky: I'm not

 10:13:31 <lifeless> jaddi27: hello ?

 10:13:34 <jaddi27> Hi, I am Joel Addison. I have been a member of the Ubuntu Australia LoCo for the past 4-5 years, and have been mostly active in translations and the Loco

 10:13:35 <Destine> jaddi27, hey?

 10:14:38 <czajkowski> jaddi27: hi there thanks for coming .

 10:15:03 <jaddi27> czajkowski, Happy to be here

 10:15:09 <czajkowski> jaddi27: so how did you get involved in ubuntu and your loco ?

 10:15:56 <jaddi27> I started using ubuntu in 2006 when I was trying to find other operating systems to use

 10:16:22 <jaddi27> I found out about the loco shortly after that, mainly through the team mailing list

 10:17:02 <jaddi27> In the last year or two, I have got more involved in the loco, and have started to chair the monthly meetings along with another member of the team

 10:18:14 <Destine> jaddi27, it seems that you did global jams. can you please briefly talk about them?

 10:19:32 <jaddi27> I ran two jams for the Precise cycle this year. The first was a wiki jam, where I aimed to clean up the Wiki section for Ubuntu-AU. We got a fair bit fixed up, so the wiki is easier to use for new people

 10:20:16 <lifeless> whats involved in running a jam ?

 10:20:22 <jaddi27> The second jam was a localisation jam, which had the aim of discussing the various aspects of ubuntu that could be localised for Australia to be released as a custom distro

 10:21:52 <jaddi27> I ran my Jams online in the IRC channel for ubuntu-au, but I see them as a good way for people interested in ubuntu to get involved with their communities and other aspects

 10:22:24 <jaddi27> They are especially good for encouraging people who are not interested in coding to get involved with Ubuntu

 10:22:42 <Destine> jaddi27, good for you.

 10:22:52 <lifeless> whats involved in running a jam ?

 10:24:22 <jaddi27> To run a jam, I advertised it in various ways, including through the IRC meetings, the mailing list, and the loco.ubuntu.com section for Ubuntu-AU. On the occasion of the event, I started a meeting in the IRC channel and lead discussions for the event

 10:25:10 <jaddi27> For example, with the Wiki Jam, I was mainly directing people as to what sections of the wiki could be improved and listening to other people's suggestions as to what could be improved

 10:25:31 <Destine> jaddi27, thank you. I am ready to vote.
