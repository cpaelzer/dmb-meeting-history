 16:07:24 <arosales> utlemming: looks like you touched this last week

 16:07:43 <utlemming> arosales: that was an accidental assignment on my part

 16:07:44 <Daviey> Hmm, i thought this was resolved

 16:12:14 <arosales> zul: Daviey: the list is largly openstack :-)

 16:12:42 <Daviey> arosales: is that because the infra teams marks them up better? :)

 16:12:43 <arosales> less cobbler, couchdb, and the oversized disk install

 16:13:04 <arosales> Daviey: or just flakey code that produces bugs

 16:13:06 <arosales> :-)

 16:13:09 <jamespage> bug 1034701 should be fixed now - its just not been closed

 16:13:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1034701 in horizon (Ubuntu Quantal) "ImportError: Could not import settings 'openstack_dashboard.settings': missing dependency on python-glanceclient" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1034701

 16:20:55 <jamespage> yep - its in the component mismatches list

 16:21:53 <jamespage> it will get swept up by the archive admins - no further action required really - but I'll update the ticket to suggest demotion.

 16:31:24 <Daviey> arosales: we continually release state code, so we are rocking

 16:31:30 <arosales> roger that

 16:32:25 <arosales> progress @ 24% on that one

 16:32:29 <arosales> Daviey: thanks

 16:34:28 <Ursinha> :D

 16:34:30 <arosales> roaksoax:  ^

 16:34:55 * roaksoax looks

 16:35:13 <roaksoax> most likely to postpone a few items

 16:35:17 <arosales> SpamapS: I think this one we need to sync up with the juju core team https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy

 16:35:26 <roaksoax> the most important things are don't

 16:35:28 <arosales> roaksoax: ok, please postpone where appropriate

 16:36:07 <arosales> roaksoax: how do you feel about https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-ha

 16:36:11 <arosales> on target for beta1?

 16:36:52 <roaksoax> arosales: debian maintainer was on hollidays so I was hoping he would reply this week, Otherwise we'll have to do something ourselves

 16:36:57 <arosales> utlemming: /me guesses some of these will go to done this week https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-jenkins-cloud-builder

 16:37:07 <roaksoax> (some stuff should hut OpenStack trunk), but if it doesn't we can ship it ourselves

 16:37:15 <arosales> roaksoax: ok, I'll leave as beta1 and check again next week

 16:37:15 <utlemming> arosales: as I type, I'm attempting to online it now

 16:37:20 <arosales> utlemming:  thanks.

 16:37:41 <arosales> m_3: still now love for unit testing https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:37:57 <arosales> at 10% :-(

 16:43:35 <SpamapS> perhaps we should seek a different QA contact?

 16:43:40 <SpamapS> hggdh hasn't joined us in a *long* time

 16:43:50 <arosales> we did meet with the QA team, and we are going to do some investigation into UTAH
