 15:01:11 <skaet> Work Items:

 15:01:11 <skaet> 2012/09/21 -  2997 (was 2996  - 2012/09/21):   Thank you for the recent push to clean up the feature status.  :)

 15:01:11 <skaet> We are still behind the trendline for some of the projects.  Please help get us back where we should be by making sure https://launchpad.net/~/+upcomingwork is up to date for your tasks. If something is clearly not going to make it this cycle, please mark it POSTPONED.

 15:01:12 <skaet> .

 15:01:14 <skaet> Thanks to those who sent in status emails,  could you please paste the link here in the channel,  since there weren�t that many when I checked earlier this morning...

 15:01:17 <skaet> ..

 15:01:32 <skaet> #topic Comments and Questions

 15:02:16 <skaet> Thank you to the release team and QA team and flavor leads for everyone�s hard work on getting all the late features landed, and tested,  and out the door for Beta2.

 15:02:34 <skaet> Now entering the last window for bug fixing before we release 12.10.  Any questions on upcoming dates/schedule above?

 15:02:47 <ogra_> foundations status - https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-September/001962.html (ogra)

 15:03:05 <ogra_> err

 15:03:07 <smartboyhw> Ubuntu Studio: No:P

 15:03:20 <ogra_> sorry, old link

 15:03:23 <ogra_> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-September/001986.html

 15:03:34 <skaet> thanks ogra_,  I'll add the links to the agenda from ubuntu-release as we get them in.

 15:03:50 <skaet> (or likely from the mail list ;) )

 15:04:06 <jbicha> \o

 15:04:17 <skaet> go jbicha

 15:04:34 <jbicha> .. (I was just waving)

 15:04:39 <skaet> welcome :)

 15:04:39 <smartboyhw> :)

 15:04:41 <seb128> jbicha, hey ;-)

 15:04:51 <skaet> any one else have their links handy or questions?

 15:05:21 <ogra_> o/

 15:05:23 <skaet> ogra_,  is it just new review blocking pam-xdg-support?

 15:05:35 <ogra_> skaet, as i understood it, yeah

 15:05:49 <seb128> it seems to have been NEW reviewed

 15:05:53 <doko> skaet, built now in q, needs a MIR

 15:05:54 <seb128> the binaries are installable

 15:06:04 <seb128> (I installed it here)

 15:06:09 <ogra_> doesnt the FFe serve as MIR too ?

 15:06:22 * ogra_ thought the bits were on the bug

 15:06:29 <seb128> no, FFe don't do code reviews nor security reviews I think

 15:06:35 <skaet> jdstrand, mdeslaur - is there anything missing for pam-xdg-support?

 15:06:36 <doko> I don't think so

 15:06:52 * xnox 0/

 15:07:26 <mdeslaur> skaet: did it get a MIR?

 15:07:56 <mdeslaur> skaet: unless one has already been performed, it should go through the MIR process and get a security audit

 15:08:02 <doko> mdeslaur, it looks fine for me, however I'd like to have the security team have a look

 15:08:03 <skaet> ogra_,  can you handle?

 15:08:22 <skaet> getting the MIR filed, so we can unblock this one?

 15:08:30 <ogra_> skaet, i'll poke slangasek ... but i thought there was MIR data in the FFe bu already

 15:08:35 <ogra_> *bug

 15:08:54 <skaet> mdeslaur, can you guys do a security review on it today?

 15:09:04 <jdstrand> I cannot

 15:09:08 <mdeslaur> skaet: what's the bug #?

 15:09:10 <jdstrand> I could do it monday

 15:09:11 <seb128> it's 300 lines of code

 15:09:16 <seb128> so shouldn't be too hard

 15:09:35 <jdstrand> well, it's pam. it's always hard

 15:09:47 <seb128> right, I was going to add a note about that ;-)

 15:09:52 <ogra_> bug 894391

 15:09:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 894391 in mountall (Ubuntu Quantal) "[FFe] support $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/894391

 15:10:11 <skaet> jdstrand,  thanks.  if someone else can't get it through today,  would be good to do it as soon as possible on monday.   Want this landing before we go into desktop infrastructure freeze.

 15:10:43 <jdstrand> might I just add, once again, that late landing code like this is hard to deal with?

 15:10:47 <skaet> (if its ok to go in ;) )

 15:10:59 <skaet> jdstrand,  no argument from me.

 15:11:12 <ogra_> jdstrand, foundations is aware and is sorry ... and will buy you beer at UDS :)

 15:12:00 <jdstrand> heh, well, at least someone from the security team

 15:12:09 <skaet> :)

 15:12:19 <skaet> .. on this one I think.

 15:12:50 <ogra_> o/

 15:12:53 <skaet> any other urgent FFE's or bug fixes that need help left,  or have we pretty much quiesced?

 15:12:59 <skaet> go ogra

 15:13:06 <skaet> go ogra_

 15:13:17 * skaet goofed up her auto complete

 15:13:32 <ogra_> popey, have the compiz bits (and its rdeps) been tested against arm this time (last abi bump i had to spend three days to fix them)

 15:13:51 <popey> ogra_, not yet, only landed in a ppa a couple of hours ago

 15:13:58 <ogra_> (though that was simply because the packagind had s/arm/foo/ across the board)

 15:14:22 <ogra_> popey, but they will ? or do i need to plan to keep time available for it ?

 15:14:43 <popey> hmm, my team has no arm hardware capable of testing compiz right now

 15:14:52 <popey> so help needed there

 15:14:53 <popey> ..

 15:15:10 <skaet> plars, balloons, ^ can you help popey

 15:15:11 <ogra_> but you at least do build tests (and take a look at the logs if GLES was enabled ?)

 15:15:53 <ogra_> popey, that would already help a lot ...

 15:16:20 <plars> I'm gone until tuesday of next week, but we may have someone else who can give it a try.  if we need to pull it from the ppa just shoot us a link and we can help take a look

 15:16:23 <ogra_> (last time the world was built for GL ... which is clearly visible in the logs for example)

 15:16:34 <popey> ogra_, ok, I'll add that to our testing.

 15:16:37 <popey> thanks!

 15:16:38 <ogra_> thx

 15:16:38 <popey> ..

 15:16:39 <ogra_> ..

 15:17:24 <skaet> before we move on,  just want to check that everyone is ok with the dates I pasted at the start of the meeting?

 15:17:43 <smartboyhw> :)

 15:17:46 <ogra_> thats all *next month* !

 15:17:54 <ogra_> so far away :)

 15:17:55 <skaet> we're pretty compressed time wise

 15:18:23 <skaet> popey,  seb128 are you going to be ok holding to the desktop infrastructure freeze next Thursday?  (happens with the kernel freeze)

 15:18:53 <skaet> ogasawara, is the kernel freeze on track?

 15:19:00 <seb128> skaet, should be fine

 15:19:05 <popey> yes

 15:19:07 <seb128> compiz updates is planned on monday

 15:19:08 <ogasawara> ogasawara: yep, planned for next week

 15:19:10 <seb128> and unity on wednesday

 15:19:28 <skaet> thanks seb128, popey, ogasawara

 15:19:49 <skaet> doko,  no other toolchain uploads to worry about?

 15:20:23 <doko> the only toolchain uploads I do worry about are glib2.0, gtk, and qt

 15:21:51 <seb128> glib and gtk got updated to the GNOME 3.6 stable version so no change expected for those

 15:22:48 <skaet> doko,  what's the issue with glib2.0?   I've seen several bug fixes go in for it recently, but not sure what's outstanding.

 15:23:08 <skaet> and what's left with qt?

 15:24:03 <doko> skaet, I see it's now built on arm after the fifth upload, so probably it's ok. however qt4-x11 didn't build yet on arm, and webkit fails. likely a launchpad issue, Laney is trying to work around it

 15:24:31 <skaet> doko,  thanks.  will keep eye open then for it.

 15:24:48 <Laney> ahoy

 15:24:59 <Laney> waiting for post-b2 skew to sort itself out so that I can test webkit locally

 15:25:30 <skaet> thanks Laney.

 15:26:32 <Laney> cautiously optimistic

 15:26:41 <Laney> providing someone toolchainy lets the make patch in

 15:27:41 <doko> Laney, could you at least forward this upstream?

 15:27:48 <doko> if it's not yet there ...

 15:28:20 <Laney> I think it was

 15:28:26 <Laney> I'll try to find the reference

 15:28:33 <Laney> it's certainly not applied though

 15:30:38 <skaet> ..?

 15:30:41 <Laney> doko: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-make/2009-07/msg00012.html is what I can come up with ATM

 15:30:49 <Laney> yes, we can discuss this elsewhere

 15:30:50 <Laney> sorry

 15:31:04 <skaet> no worries.   good to get it resolved.

 15:31:08 <skaet> seb128, popey - there are a couple of critical bugs on the tracking list.  At least one is stale (I recognize it, and will mark it fix released ;) )  Could you both take a pass at http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html ? and make sure all the criticals either have a 12.10 date or quantal-updates beside them,  so we can make sure we're focusing on the right things for the next wee

 15:31:08 <skaet> k?

 15:31:49 <seb128> skaet, it's on my todo for today, sorry I got a behind this week catching up after holidays and with beta2

 15:32:06 <popey> thanks seb128

 15:32:07 <ogra_> they let you do holidays ?!?

 15:32:07 <skaet> ogra_,  if foundations could do the same,  it would help make sure we're all focusing on the important bigs,  since those lists are rather long.

 15:32:17 <ogra_> yup

 15:32:57 <seb128> ogra_, yeah, not sure what they were thinking :p

 15:33:02 <ogra_> :)

 15:33:14 <skaet> ogasawara,  and kernel team is the champ of the long list right now...  ;)

 15:33:38 <ogra_> yeah, we should go without kernels, they always have bugs :)

 15:33:56 <ogasawara> ogra_: +1 :)

 15:34:02 <Daviey> hurd++

 15:34:08 <ogasawara> skaet: I think that's due to the CVE's which we've discussed earlier

 15:34:08 <popey> That's it, I'm switching to GNU/Hurd!

 15:34:08 <ogra_> thats also a kernel

 15:34:37 <skaet> anyhow,  will be using that list exclusively for the next couple of weeks to make sure the important fixes land in 12.10 - so if you have bug fix that needs to land, but is not on that list,  please let me know and I'll help sort.

 15:35:04 <skaet> ogasawara, yeah,  that's it mostly,  but for the high/criticals - would be good to know what will land this week, and what's definitely SRU teritory

 15:35:14 <ogasawara> skaet: ack

 15:36:13 <skaet> Daviey,  arosales -  there's one critical that seems stalled, but is on the list - wanting to know if its really critical, and likely to land?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1026102

 15:36:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1026102 in Ubuntu Quantal "Openstack provider does not validate https certs" [Critical,New]

 15:37:43 <skaet> anyhow,  if we can have a nice crisp list by next Thursday,  would very much appreciate,  since there's only a couple of days after that until final freeze.

 15:38:15 <skaet> ....

 15:39:07 * skaet will be continuing to ping out of band on these for the next week or two...

 15:40:01 <Daviey> skaet: looking

 15:40:12 <skaet> Riddell, ScottK, knome, stgraber, highvoltage, scott-work, gilir, ogra_, infinity - please review: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseManifest and make sure all the last changes for your images are there.

 15:40:38 <skaet> in particular for gilir,  does lubuntu still want to carry alternate images?

 15:40:46 <Daviey> skaet: will follow u, thanks

 15:40:49 <stgraber> skaet: edubuntu looks good

 15:41:06 <gilir> skaet, yes

 15:41:20 <ogra_> arm looks fine too

 15:42:24 <skaet> thanks,  ok,  please sign the manifest in the "Target" column by entering the date.  :)

 15:43:06 <skaet> other topic...   for same audience ;)

 15:43:11 <skaet> Riddell, ScottK, knome, stgraber, highvoltage, scott-work, gilir, ogra_, infinity - could you please review the test cases on the iso tracker for your flavors/community ports - and make sure they are accurate for the mandatory/run once/optional?   For the release we will be aiming for 100% coverage.   Please work with balloons to adjust any testcases, if necessary, before October 4, 2012.

 15:43:11 * smartboyhw thinks there will be edit conflict:P

 15:43:28 * skaet is old hand at resolving edit conflicts,  don't worry.

 15:43:32 <smartboyhw> LOL

 15:43:40 <ogra_> skaet, k

 15:43:55 <cjwatson> skaet: we're hammering rls-q-tracking pretty hard at the moment FWIW - it's down about 12 or so over the last two days

 15:43:59 <balloons> :-) yes, the mandatory/run-once/optional are important

 15:44:51 <skaet> cjwatson,  thank you.  :)

 15:45:03 <cjwatson> (and we have no actual critical-priority bugs there right now)

 15:45:16 <skaet> *\o/*

 15:45:55 <ScottK> o/

 15:46:10 <skaet> keep up the good work.   other teams,   feel free to be competitive in terms of getting most fixes in ;)

 15:46:24 <skaet> and all critical bugs off the list.

 15:46:30 <skaet> go ScottK

 15:46:54 <ScottK> I've started to be very skeptical of UIFe requests for things that are just tweaks/new functions.

 15:47:23 <ScottK> I think we should do that generally as people need to be focused on fixing stuff and not wouldn't it be nice if ...  ideas.

 15:47:43 <ScottK> I've also starting saying no to nice to have FFe's too.

 15:47:48 <ScottK> ..

 15:48:50 <skaet> ScottK,  agreed.   We're out of time for nice to haves.

 15:49:28 <skaet> yesterday's UIFe has a quote from Mark that makes that point as well,  I think.  from a UIFe perspective at least.

 15:50:35 <skaet> any one else have comment?  questions?

 15:50:48 <skaet> or are we pretty much at the end of the meeting now?

 15:50:56 <ScottK> Do we know where we are on the https change for shopping?

 15:51:05 <ScottK> That's more than slightly essential.

 15:51:30 <skaet> I thought I saw that Laney approved it already,  but haven't double checked it this morning.

 15:51:46 <skaet> seb128, ^ any update?

 15:52:08 <seb128> let me check

 15:52:09 <Laney> it's merged

 15:52:36 <Laney> we should probably cherry-pick it into the distro

 15:52:59 <skaet> please

 15:53:09 <seb128> there is an update planned for next week

 15:53:22 <seb128> do you prefer than to go earlier?

 15:53:28 <Laney> definitely

 15:53:28 <seb128> e.g to try to land it today?

 15:53:39 <Laney> is the server ready?

 15:54:15 <skaet> if we can pull the pieces together.  more time we have to shake it down, better it will be.

 15:54:26 <seb128> Laney, server is ready

 15:54:38 <Laney> OK, I'll upload it shortly then

 15:54:39 <seb128> skaet, Laney: I will have a go at backporting it today

 15:54:40 <Laney> oh

 15:54:43 <Laney> even better :P

 15:54:47 <seb128> Laney, or do you want to do it?

 15:54:52 <skaet> Thanks seb128 !  :)

 15:54:55 <Laney> no preference

 15:54:55 <seb128> yw

 15:56:17 <skaet> ..

 15:56:22 <ScottK> The only other thing that I thought was really essential was the online search privacy change and I approved that yesterday and I see bits of it are landing.

 15:56:23 <skaet> #endmeeting
