 15:13:43 <bdmurray> done

 15:14:24 <doko> - vacation last week

 15:14:24 <doko> - catch up with email

 15:14:24 <doko> - started test rebuild

 15:14:24 <doko> - prepared packages for gcc-4.7 test rebuild

 15:14:24 <doko> - gccgo-4.7.0

 15:14:24 <doko> - Linaro call

 15:14:52 <ogra_> done ?

 15:15:42 * ogra_ assumes so

 15:15:45 <ogra_> done:

 15:15:45 <ogra_> * bugwork on 960710 (jasper doesnt enable deb-src on preinstalled images)

 15:15:45 <ogra_> * lots of (time consuming) debugging work on bug 961133

 15:15:45 <ogra_> * uploaded pvr sgx driver (sitting in NEW to go to multiverse, then we can add the compiz GLES patch and add jasper support for pvr)

 15:15:45 <ogra_> * started reworking partman-uboot for vfat to fix bug 872525 (thabnks colin for pointing to it)

 15:15:47 <ogra_> * stopwatched initrdless boot on panda to serial login prompt: with initrd 50sec, without initrd 25sec. so dropping the initrd from panda installs would win us 25sec

 15:15:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 961133 in linux (Ubuntu) "No video output from Ubuntu Desktop ARM Images on my Pandaboard to my DVI monitor" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/961133

 15:15:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 872525 in partman-uboot (Ubuntu Precise) "No option for u-boot partition on armel omap/omap4 platforms" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/872525

 15:15:50 <ogra_> (note that u-boot initialization takes about 10sec)

 15:15:52 <ogra_> * lots of arm community support

 15:15:54 <ogra_> * self review done)

 15:15:56 <ogra_> beta2:

 15:16:00 <ogra_> * tested ac100 images and fixed a minor issue

 15:16:02 <ogra_> * tested omap4 images

 15:16:04 <ogra_> * still testing omap3

 15:16:06 <ogra_> todo:

 15:16:08 <ogra_> * merge compiz GLES patch once the driver is up

 15:16:10 <ogra_> * look into jockey PVR driver integration

 15:16:12 <ogra_> * look into fsck slowdown

 15:16:14 <ogra_> * finish partman-uboot rewrite for omap3/4

 15:16:16 <ogra_> * peer reviews

 15:16:27 <ogra_> the initrdless boot stuff was very intresting ... jodh i still see upstart complain about ptys btw ... but it finishes the boot

 15:16:48 <jodh> yes, it will complain, then fall back to "console none".

 15:17:03 <jodh> Maybe we'll bundle mountall into upstart for Q? :)

 15:17:27 <jodh> ogra_: done?

 15:17:48 <ogra_> dropping the initrd on arm got me at best 12sec boots (from loading kernel to login prompt) since i stopwatch its not very precise so i took the worst measuring ... but it looks like we can cut boottime in half on pandas with dropping initrd

 15:17:54 <ogra_> (sorry was typing)

 15:17:57 <ogra_> done ;)

 15:18:08 <jodh> * [misc]

 15:18:08 <jodh> * Performance self+mgr review.

 15:18:08 <jodh> * Put PPU application together.

 15:18:08 <jodh> * [boot/upstart]

 15:18:11 <jodh> * [#] Upstart 1.5 release and associated Ubuntu merge.

 15:18:15 <jodh> * Big update to upstart-events(7).

 15:18:20 <jodh> * Upstart Cookbook updates.

 15:18:23 <jodh> * Lots of IRC today discussion (resulting in another pending Cookbook update).

 15:18:23 <jodh> * [boot/plymouth]

 15:18:26 <jodh> * Working on Plymouth SIGSEGV bugs (553745, 849414).

 15:18:29 <jodh> ⟰

 15:18:33 <jodh> 

 15:18:36 <jodh> ogra_: nice!

 15:18:48 <slangasek> ogra_: how does that compare with the boot time when using a "minimal" initrd, which I think was the other part of that comparison that the kernel team wanted?

 15:18:52 <ogra_> yes, its pretty impressive

 15:19:12 <slangasek> (i.e., an initramfs that doesn't start udev or contain modules, just immediately resolves the rootfs and pivots)

 15:19:23 <ogra_> right, havent tested that yet

 15:19:29 <slangasek> ok

 15:19:45 <ogra_> but given that the loading even of a very small file in u-boot doesnt happen under 5 sec ...

 15:20:02 <slangasek> ogra_: ah :)

 15:20:12 <cjwatson> what's it doing?!

 15:20:21 <infinity> Your uBoot seems a lot sadder than mine...

 15:20:22 <ogra_> i'll test with the minimal one for getting the numbers at least

 15:20:35 <cjwatson> Reparsing a filesystem every time or something?

 15:20:49 <cjwatson> (and badly, presumably)

 15:20:51 <ogra_> it loads the file from slow media (SD), then removes the header and suffles it around in ram

 15:20:59 <ogra_> *shuffles

 15:21:10 <slangasek> and using a terrible i/o implementation for the load, too

 15:21:12 <ogra_> i'm sure it can be made faster on the ram side

 15:21:21 <ogra_> but the SD is always in the way

 15:21:27 <cjwatson> slangasek: right, that wouldn't have accounted for 5s on small files on its own though

 15:21:36 <slangasek> yeah

 15:21:42 <slangasek> infinity: your turn again

 15:21:51 <infinity> - fix p11-kit bug 911436 in two ways

 15:21:52 <infinity> - performance reviews (manager + self)

 15:21:52 <infinity> - beta 2 release management involvement

 15:21:52 <infinity> - land lp-buildd performance improvements, and coordinate roll out

 15:21:52 <infinity> - work with IS on reallocation of beagles as livefs buildds

 15:21:54 <infinity> - look into bug 965840

 15:21:56 <infinity> - review PVR drivers and offer feedback for 959924

 15:22:40 <slangasek> great

 15:22:43 <ogra_> any issues with the drivers ?

 15:23:09 <infinity> ogra_: The first time around, I bounced them back to ricardo and he completely repackaged them.

 15:23:17 <infinity> ogra_: I haven't had a chance to review the second roung. :)

 15:23:22 <ogra_> ah, k

 15:23:22 <infinity> round*

 15:23:26 <ogra_> :)

 15:24:30 <slangasek> any other questions on any of the above?

 15:25:11 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:25:19 <cjwatson> stgraber: I'd just like to say thanks again for the queuebot improvements - it's fantastic now

 15:25:40 <slangasek> bdmurray: what's hot in bugland?

 15:25:48 <infinity> cjwatson: You can blame me for nagging him every 3 minutes with weird suggestions. :P

 15:25:53 <stgraber> cjwatson: np :)

 15:26:13 <bdmurray> well, I happened to be looking at hot bugs recently and ran across bug 606491

 15:26:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 606491 in anacron (Ubuntu) "start: Job is already running: anacron" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/606491

 15:27:09 <bdmurray> which may be related to bug 226780

 15:27:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 226780 in apt (Ubuntu) "apt-key net-update does not obey APT::Acquire::http::Proxy" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/226780

 15:28:56 <slangasek> 606491> interesting

 15:29:09 <slangasek> I wonder if that's really an anacron bug

 15:29:18 <slangasek> or if it should be handled as a bug in whatever job is hanging

 15:29:25 <slangasek> (i.e., apt)

 15:29:48 <infinity> If apt really is hanging.

 15:30:57 <infinity> And for what definition of "hang".

 15:31:01 * slangasek adds this to the queue for further investigation

 15:31:43 <bdmurray> that's all I have so far - lots of iso-testing bugs to look at

 15:32:05 <jodh> Hmm... anacron seems to be everywhere - /etc/apm/event.d/anacron

 15:32:10 <cjwatson> Nothing looked too terrible when I looked earlier today, but no doubt there've been a slew since then

 15:33:18 <cjwatson> (of iso-testing)

 15:33:37 <slangasek> bug #966403 is the one on my radar from iso testing

 15:33:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 966403 in plymouth (Ubuntu) "Lubuntu Install (entire disk with encryption) doesn't prompt for disk password." [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/966403

 15:33:53 <slangasek> I'll see if I can't get to the bottom of that today

 15:34:15 <slangasek> UnreportableReason: This is not an official Ubuntu package. Please remove any third party package and try again.

 15:34:22 <slangasek> huh, why's *that* in the bug report?

 15:36:12 <ogra_> theming issue eh ? *g*

 15:36:56 <slangasek> maybe

 15:37:37 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:37:42 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:38:27 <slangasek> thanks again everyone for the great work last week on the installer sprint - and for being flexible in your working hours

 15:39:18 <phillw> +1

 15:40:50 <barry> it was fun and productive!

 15:41:36 <ogra_> ++

 15:41:53 <stgraber> +1

 15:42:03 <ogra_> btw, if that didnt come across ... i didnt mind the virtual jetlag actually :)

 15:42:22 <slangasek> heh :)
