 20:00:53 <jmarsden|work> Let's see who is here :)

 20:00:57 <kanliot> hi

 20:01:00 <will_> hi

 20:01:25 * MrChrisDruif lurks

 20:01:57 <jmarsden|work> OK, this may be a short meeting...

 20:02:10 <jmarsden|work> #topic Review of Action Items from Last Meeting

 20:02:38 <jmarsden|work> Prevous meeting is logged at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Meetings/20120516

 20:03:12 <jmarsden|work> StevenSmallty is not here, so we don't know status of his action items.

 20:03:33 <kanliot> ok

 20:03:41 <jmarsden|work> I failed to email the list about wiki champion volunteers, I think, but kanliot volunteered.

 20:03:42 <kanliot> it's not smalty

 20:03:52 <jmarsden|work> Right, typo :)

 20:04:17 <jmarsden|work> *StevenSmally

 20:04:44 <jmarsden|work> So, kanliot, are you willing and able to coordinate wiki changes from now onwards?

 20:04:52 <kanliot> yeah

 20:05:00 <kanliot> sorry for short answer

 20:05:51 <jmarsden|work> OK.  I don't think we have enough people here for a very "convincing" vote, if you see what I mean, but I propose that we give you that role.  Is there any info or specific things you need from MrChrisDruif to take over this responsibility?

 20:06:10 <kanliot> can't think of anything

 20:06:17 <kanliot> besides chris has been very helpful

 20:06:23 <jmarsden|work> OK, good -- feel free to get to work :)

 20:06:30 <kanliot> not like i have to twist his arm or anything

 20:06:49 <jmarsden|work> Understood.

 20:06:55 <MrChrisDruif> I remain a member of the docs team, so any questions on how to change this or if needs be removing/redirecting can still be asked

 20:07:04 <MrChrisDruif> this=things

 20:07:45 <jmarsden|work> Good, thanks MrChrisDruif -- it is always helpful to have smooth friendly transfers of responsibilities

 20:08:05 <MrChrisDruif> o7

 20:08:55 <jmarsden|work> we've had some governance discussion recently but we are not ready for any specific proposals at this point, as I understand it.

 20:09:10 <kanliot> ya

 20:09:26 <jmarsden|work> OK... any other items we should be discussing here?

 20:10:56 <jmarsden|work> OK... none heard.  Don't forget to look at the blueprint for our work towards 12.10 and see how you can help move any of those work items forward.

 20:11:02 <jmarsden|work> Thanks all!

 20:11:06 <kanliot> ty
