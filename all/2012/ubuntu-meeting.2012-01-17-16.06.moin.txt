 16:18:51 <hallyn> i've been involved before

 16:19:00 <hallyn> at this point we need someone familiar with module-init-tools to step in

 16:19:11 <Daviey> Do we know who that is?

 16:19:11 <hallyn> who babysits that?

 16:19:12 <smb> The thing is that I was lost a bit to where to add the additional alias

 16:19:28 <hallyn> right, bc the file where debian has it, we don't ship

 16:19:49 <smb> iow is nfs-common allowed to create a file in /etc/modprobe.d

 16:45:57 <Daviey> smb: is bug 902951 infact fixed?

 16:45:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 902951 in linux (Ubuntu) "CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK shouldnt be a module" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/902951

 16:46:04 <smb> Daviey, Looking there seems like a iommu thing

 16:46:32 <smb> Daviey, VIRTIO_BLK will be built in in precise

 16:46:39 <smb> Need to update the bug probably

 16:46:44 <Daviey> neat

 16:47:08 <Daviey> The only other issue with the kernel seems to be odd sound on my laptop :).. but OT here. :)

 16:47:19 <Daviey> i'm done, thanks smb

 16:47:28 <roaksoax> alright, I guess we can move on

 16:47:48 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:47:55 <roaksoax> rbasak: your turn

 16:48:23 <rbasak> So I spoke to the arm team last week

 16:48:31 <rbasak> the consensus is that I will bridge the two meetings

 16:48:40 <Daviey> \o/

 16:49:01 <rbasak> precise is working on armhf for me now, juju still a bit broken

 16:49:16 <Daviey> rbasak: have bugs?

 16:49:41 <rbasak> I filed bug 917664 earlier

 16:49:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917664 in juju (Ubuntu) "juju lxc on precise is hardcoded to oneiric" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917664

 16:50:10 <rbasak> we're almost certainly going to be going for armhf on server

 16:50:15 <Daviey> rbasak: do you think this is importiant to release of precise?

 16:50:20 <rbasak> yes

 16:50:46 * Daviey adds it to the list.

 16:50:46 <smoser> rbasak, so we decided i believe that there is no point in doing cloud-images for armel, right?

 16:51:16 <rbasak> Yes, that's my understanding. Is there any reason we need them that I'm missing?

 16:51:16 <smoser> we should have a bug for "replace armel with armhf(??) for arch of cloud-images" then

 16:51:25 <smoser> i can't think of any

 16:51:32 <lynxman> Daviey: Sorry was trapped in the juju world :) The new upstream snapshot is ready, packaged, branched and pending your review

 16:51:38 <jamespage> ls

 16:52:10 <SpamapS> rbasak: I believe that juju bug is actually already reported and assigned to hazmat...

 16:52:14 <Daviey> lynxman: ah, linky?

 16:52:34 <SpamapS> rbasak: bug 914392

 16:52:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 914392 in juju "LXC local provider does not respect 'series' (only installs oneiric)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/914392

 16:52:53 <lynxman> Daviey: https://code.launchpad.net/~lynxman/ubuntu/precise/ipxe/newsnapshot

 16:53:03 <rbasak> SpamapS: agreed, thanks!

 16:53:05 <Daviey> lynxman: thanks.

 16:53:40 <Daviey> anything else?

 16:53:46 <SpamapS> rbasak: marked as dupe

 16:53:55 <rbasak> thanks SpamapS

 16:53:56 <SpamapS> Daviey: ^^ please adjust accordingly

 16:54:05 <rbasak> I'm done, I'll start keeping a proper list for future meetings

 16:54:16 <roaksoax> ok then I guess we can move on if there's nothing else for rbasak

 16:54:21 <Daviey> SpamapS: thanks

 16:54:35 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

 16:55:01 <roaksoax> anyone from the community has anything to bring to the table?

 16:55:11 * ScottK is working with lamont on postfix updates.

 16:55:25 <Daviey> ScottK: Awesome!!

 16:55:33 <Daviey> ScottK: anything interesting in the pipelines?

 16:55:36 <ScottK> He's doing 2.8.7 for precise and then I'll do microversion updates for natty/oneric.

 16:55:43 <Daviey> \o/

 16:55:44 <ScottK> This is just bug fixes.

 16:55:53 <ScottK> Then backports for Lucid/Maverick.

 16:56:00 <ScottK> But 2.9.0 is close.

 16:56:22 <ScottK> That, interestingly enough, will have an optional memcached client.

 16:56:24 <SpamapS> roaksoax: since I'm from the community.. I'd like to bring to the table that this particular section is rather troubling.. and that we should try to involve non-Canonical people in all sections, since we're all part of the "community"

 16:56:30 <lynxman> Since it's QA time, it's worth submitting a bug for xen-tools? It says somewhere that it's being deprecated, nonetheless it's defaults are broken for creating new xen servers

 16:56:35 <ScottK> SpamapS: +1

 16:56:41 <lynxman> SpamapS: +1

 16:57:11 <roaksoax> SpamapS: fine by me too

 16:57:15 <rbasak> SpamapS: while I agree, I think it's important to give people a specific opportunity to comment! Better to have a specific agenda item than feel that there is no agenda item at all

 16:57:41 <ScottK> Just change is to Other updates and questions.

 16:57:45 <ScottK> is/it

 16:57:47 <SpamapS> I believe this section used to be specifically updats from the Canonical "community team" and then was morphed to this.. but really, we're all at this meeting specifically to address the community as a whole.. so I see no need for this section.

 16:57:58 <smb> lynxman, I am not sure I understand what you say. Maybe you could explain when I am more awake. :)

 16:58:15 <roaksoax> I guess we can merge this topic with Open Discussion

 16:58:20 <lynxman> smb: xen-tools generate xen images that lack the load of xenblk on startup so they always fall back to ramdisk

 16:58:21 <ScottK> Yeah.

 16:58:21 <SpamapS> rbasak: each agenda item is, and should be, oriented toward the community.

 16:58:38 <jsalisbury> Roll Call for Ubuntu Kernel Weekly Status Meeting

 16:58:41 <rbasak> SpamapS: absolutely - but is that communicated effectively at every meeting? Because this agenda item is.

 16:58:45 <ScottK> roaksoax: I agree.  I thought this was a fancy name for open discussion.

 16:58:48 <SpamapS> 2 minutes remaining..

 16:58:58 <smb> lynxman, You know that we at least now built-in the frontend driver?

 16:59:00 <SpamapS> we won't have time to finish this discussion here. Shall we defer to next week?

 16:59:09 <roaksoax> ScottK: we have both at the moment :/

 16:59:11 * ScottK votes SpamapS for dictator of agenda reworking.

 16:59:26 <ScottK> SpamapS: JFDI.  Fix it.

 16:59:36 <SpamapS> roaksoax: action please?

 16:59:52 <SpamapS> And then I suppose we should wrap up.

 17:00:07 <lynxman> smb: I do, this is latest oneiric, broken ):

 17:00:13 <lynxman> smb: bug has been sitting ducks

 17:00:14 <roaksoax> [action] Discuss merge of Open Discussion with Community update topics

 17:00:14 * meetingology Discuss merge of Open Discussion with Community update topics

 17:00:17 <lynxman> smb: I'll raise it later

 17:00:24 <Daviey> Everyone say hello to arosales, three cheers for the new Ubuntu Server Workloads Manager.

 17:00:28 <smb> lynxman, k

 17:00:31 <lynxman> arosales: \o/ \o/

 17:00:34 <rbasak> hip hip

 17:00:34 <SpamapS> \o/

 17:00:35 <Daviey> hip hip.

 17:00:35 <arosales> :-)

 17:01:01 <roaksoax> same date/time

 17:01:10 <arosales> thanks for the welcome :-)

 17:01:26 <SpamapS> thanks for attending everyone!

 17:01:37 <Daviey> thanks roaksoax for driving.

 17:01:39 <lynxman> roaksoax: \o/

 17:01:46 <roaksoax> SpamapS: welcome ;)

 17:01:52 * SpamapS eyes the pensive kernel team and figures we should probably get outta here while the gettin's good

 17:01:55 <roaksoax> #endmeeting
