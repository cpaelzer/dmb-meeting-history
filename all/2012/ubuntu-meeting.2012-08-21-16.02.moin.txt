 16:13:27 <roaksoax> it doesn't seem to be much to be done

 16:13:41 <zul> i thought it was done...daviey did an upload

 16:13:47 <SpamapS> how can any of us do anything?

 16:13:52 <roaksoax> yeah it seems so

 16:13:53 <SpamapS> seems like its just an archive admin thing

 16:13:57 <roaksoax> indeed

 16:14:03 <roaksoax> alright, let's move on then

 16:14:07 <adam_g> roaksoax: sorry, the quantum upload are still blocked on MIRs AFAIK

 16:14:08 <roaksoax> [LINK] Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:14:12 <Daviey> I did the upload required for the other task

 16:14:17 <Daviey> that is an AA task

 16:14:27 <roaksoax> Daviey: thanks ;)

 16:14:38 <arosales> roaksoax: I have a few high /essentials in the red to go over if thats ok.

 16:14:47 <Daviey> <--- on a call

 16:14:52 <roaksoax> arosales: please do

 16:15:03 <arosales> So feature freeze is this Thursday and beta1 is next week. 68% way through the release.

 16:15:24 <arosales> If we could start evaluating which work items will need to be postponed this will help notify folks at a reasonable time that a feature won't make it instead of surprising them close to time of release.

 16:15:48 <arosales> zul: are the following openstack BPs progressing ok? Perhaps these are items that land late in the cycle due to the OpenStack release schedule.

 16:16:00 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-qa

 16:16:00 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-folsom

 16:16:00 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-stable

 16:16:28 <zul> arosales: the openstack-qa and opestack-stable doesnt affect feature freeze and i think we are ok for openstack-folsom

 16:16:41 <arosales> zul: ok thanks.

 16:16:47 <arosales> roaksoax: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-ha

 16:17:10 <roaksoax> arosales: 1 thing waiting on AA work

 16:17:26 <arosales> roaksoax: thanks

 16:17:28 <roaksoax> the rest waiting on Debian, so I'll catch up today/tomorrow and make necessary uploads

 16:17:41 <arosales> great, thanks

 16:17:45 <arosales> bug-triage-review and iso-tests-review I will follow up with jamespage when he returns.

 16:17:54 <arosales> Spamaps, I think we already hit on  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy yesterday

 16:18:03 <arosales> m_3: jimbaker: is https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests up to date?

 16:18:36 <SpamapS> we did

 16:18:40 <SpamapS> email drafting today :)

 16:18:59 <arosales> SpamapS: thanks

 16:19:23 <arosales> utlemming: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-jenkins-cloud-builder

 16:20:07 <utlemming> arosales: it'll make it

 16:20:26 <arosales> looking ok for beta1 next week?

 16:20:34 <arosales> utlemming:  ^

 16:20:35 <utlemming> arosales: its almost done, I just need to flip the switch, which I think will happen tomorrow

 16:20:44 <utlemming> arosales: yup

 16:21:03 <jimbaker> arosales, i'm looking now

 16:21:06 <utlemming> arosales: I was waiting till 12.04.1 to be safe

 16:21:28 <arosales> utlemming: makes sense, and the external read-only jenkis and notifications coming post beta1?

 16:21:51 <jimbaker> arosales, i don't think m_3 has gotten a chance to work on it. i know i haven't :)

 16:22:05 <utlemming> arosales: no eta on the external jenkins instance, but that is not a blocker. That can be implemented any time with out affecting the build service.

 16:22:12 <jimbaker> arosales, in terms of the blueprints update

 16:22:15 <arosales> jimbaker: ok I'll sync up with you and m_3 later today on the pregress -- thanks

 16:22:37 <arosales> those were the red high/essential BPs

 16:22:54 <jimbaker> (our BPs are further behind than we are, fortunately)

 16:22:58 <arosales> just one last suggestion to postpone work items that we know we aren't going to make :-)

 16:23:19 <arosales> jimbaker: better that way then reverse :-)

 16:23:24 <arosales> roaksoax: back to you

 16:23:27 <jimbaker> arosales, for sure ;)

 16:23:28 <roaksoax> alright

 16:23:43 <arosales> did anyone else have any BPs to go over?

 16:23:57 <roaksoax> so if there's no more to bring to the table on quantal development, let's move on, shall we?

 16:24:10 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:24:12 <roaksoax> smoser:

 16:24:12 <m_3> arosales: no, that unit test blueprint isn't up to date

 16:24:27 <smoser> well, we're almost there.

 16:24:27 <roaksoax> jamespage:

 16:24:42 <roaksoax> m_3: sorry about that

 16:25:03 <roaksoax> smoser:  do you want me to go over the SRU bugs?

 16:25:04 <SpamapS> seriously impressive amount of bug fixes shipped

 16:25:10 <smoser> i really dont think there is much to say, as there is not much that can be done at this point.

 16:25:23 <roaksoax> alright, lets move on then

 16:25:25 <smoser> if the bug isn't in -proposed, it is -updates, which is fine.

 16:28:22 <roaksoax> hggdh: you are up :)

 16:29:01 <roaksoax> seems he is not around, let's get back to him later

 16:29:06 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:29:12 <roaksoax> smb: howdy!

 16:29:15 <smb> hi

 16:29:18 <smb> Spent some time looking at bug 1011792. Only having stack traces

 16:29:18 <smb> (even more so since those usually are from older kernels) does not

 16:29:18 <smb> help too much. There are currently a few things which I asked them

 16:29:18 <smb> to do try. Waiting on those answers (not too actively as I am

 16:29:18 <smb> prematurely leaving towards San Diego tomorrow to have a few days

 16:29:19 <smb> off before XenSummit and Plumbers which I am at. And maybe it can

 16:29:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1011792 in linux-lts-backport-oneiric (Ubuntu) "Kernel lockup running 3.0.0 and 3.2.0 on multiple EC2 instance types" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1011792

 16:29:21 <smb> be discussed there for more ideas in some hallway discussion.

 16:29:27 <smb> utlemming, if lightning strikes and fires start burning during the

 16:29:29 <smb> rest of this week, apw knows a bit about the topic now.

 16:29:51 <smb> Apart from this, zul, if you remember that libvirt source package

 16:29:52 <smb> you wanted to look at one of those days... IIRC you now need to

 16:29:52 <smb> tweak it because there was yet another upload to Quantal. The

 16:29:52 <smb> outdated version still is at chinstrap:~smb/4review.

 16:29:58 <utlemming> smb: I was pinged last night after hours, but I missed it

 16:30:15 <zul> frig

 16:30:52 <smb> utlemming, I think there is now enough to let them gather data

 16:31:03 <smb> At least enough to cover until next week... :-P

 16:31:26 <smb> ..

 16:32:43 <roaksoax> Alright, if theres nothing else to discuss with smb, lets move on! [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:32:46 <roaksoax> err

 16:32:55 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:32:58 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. Any questions for me?

 16:32:59 <roaksoax> rbasak: howdy!

 16:33:43 <roaksoax> anyone questions for rbasak ?

 16:33:45 <hallyn> rbasak: woudl you mind running the lxc-testsuite against arm if you get a chance?

 16:33:58 <hallyn> i *think* a team is doing that regularly, but i like to make sure

 16:34:05 <rbasak> hallyn: we were just discussing this today. I believe we already are, but perhaps an old version

 16:34:36 <hallyn> ok, if it's being discussed, i'm happy :)  thanks

 16:34:42 <rbasak> it's on mreed's todo (I don't think he's here or in #ubuntu-server but he's working on it)

 16:34:43 <hallyn> (that reminds me i have a fix i need to push to bzr in the tests)

 16:34:48 <hallyn> great, thanks

 16:35:16 <roaksoax> alright, if there's nothing else to discuss here

 16:35:19 <roaksoax> lets move on

 16:35:22 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Open Discussion

 16:35:29 <roaksoax> anyone has anything to discuss?

 16:35:36 <SpamapS> meetings are too short

 16:35:38 <SpamapS> lets make them longer

 16:35:44 <SpamapS> and have more people talk at once

 16:36:00 <SpamapS> maybe lots of ascii art diagrams?

 16:36:01 <zul> i think its the right length

 16:36:18 <zul> but then again whats the sound of one hand clapping

 16:36:40 <roaksoax> \o/

 16:37:08 <SpamapS> roaksoax: thanks for chairing

 16:37:19 <roaksoax> glad to help :)

 16:37:23 <roaksoax> alright, so

 16:37:30 <arosales> roaksoax: thanks

 16:37:33 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Announce next meeting date and time
