 00:00:21 <greg-g> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for <DATE>. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:00:27 <greg-g> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 00:00:32 <greg-g> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:00:36 <greg-g> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:00:42 <greg-g> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:00:48 <greg-g> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:00:55 <greg-g> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:01:02 <greg-g> kdub? Kevin? you here?

 00:10:56 <ashams> yes

 00:11:00 <greg-g> #topic ashams for membership

 00:11:06 <greg-g> great, please introduce yourself ashams

 00:11:12 <ashams> Hello, my Name is Ahmed Shams, Egyptian, Ubuntu Translator, Bug Triager and Community worker.

 00:11:22 <ashams> First, sorry for increasing you load, as I should have my meeting with EMEA instead of Americas RMB!.

 00:11:34 <greg-g> ashams: what time is it for you?!

 00:11:42 <ashams> 2 am

 00:11:44 <ashams> :)

 00:11:46 <greg-g> eek!

 00:11:54 <ashams> I started to contribute to Ubuntu since 2009, with translation, support and testing, then tried to get more involved by focusing on bug triage and support for Touchpad problems in Ubuntu. Since that, I take care of touchpad-related issues, besides finding and triaging papercuts.

 00:11:57 <MrChrisDruif> Ghehe, 1 am here

 00:11:59 <greg-g> is there a reason you choose to do it with us instead of EMEA?

 00:12:22 <ashams> yes, I was confused of time of emea date

 00:12:35 <ashams> I thought it was 10th of jan instead of 3rd

 00:12:46 * greg-g nods

 00:13:01 <ashams> because I thought it would be delayed for vacation

 00:13:09 <ashams> In Community side, I'm serving as LoCo teams' ML moderator, keeper of the wiki-site and member of the current *step*-council. Outside the LoCo, I found my home in ~ubuntu-leadership(-dev) team and going with those good people to develop how things go in here.

 00:13:38 <ashams> You can find my page here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AhmedShams

 00:14:04 <ashams> done

 00:14:26 <dinda> ashams:  I applaud your enthusiasm for staying up unitl 2am for this meeting!

 00:14:40 <ashams> dinda, thanks :-)

 00:15:35 <dinda> ashams:  when do you think the Egyptian Loco team might be ready to try for 'official' status?

 00:16:01 <ashams> dinda, we were planning for this a couple of months ago

 00:16:09 <MrChrisDruif> ashams; looks good. I'll take your contributions section as a "template" for my own contributions page

 00:16:14 <ashams> but we prefered to get better organization first

 00:16:22 <ashams> that's why we got a council

 00:16:30 <ashams> or rather a step council

 00:16:39 <dinda> ashams:  it can be difficult to get organzied for such a large community

 00:16:46 <ashams> we want to get more *stable* activity as first goal

 00:16:55 <greg-g> good idea

 00:17:13 <dinda> ashams:  is it mostly IRC activity or events?

 00:17:15 <greg-g> if you have any questions or need assistance, do join the #ubuntu-locoteams channel and ask questions.

 00:17:16 <ashams> dinda, yes it can, but we borrowed the idea of Focus Groups to help with this

 00:17:19 * greg-g is on the LoCo Council

 00:17:37 <ashams> dinda, events

 00:17:43 <dinda> great!

 00:17:54 <ashams> greg-g, thanks, sure I'd :-)

 00:18:00 * SergioMeneses -> hi all

 00:18:07 <TiMiDo> hi SergioMeneses

 00:18:16 <ashams> dinda, actually we don't focus on IRC events that much

 00:18:20 <n0rman> ashams: are there any pics of the Egyptian LoCo team?

 00:18:37 <ashams> n0rman, ah, yes, let my find it

 00:19:21 <greg-g> while you do that, lets vote ;)

 00:22:03 <vibhav> PS : please excuse me if I become dead for some time

 00:22:16 <vibhav> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/vibhav

 00:22:18 * MrChrisDruif has seen vibhav's name before somewhere...

 00:22:22 <greg-g> also, why did you attend this one instead of another, more timezone appropriate, membership board?

 00:22:36 <bkerensa> Congrats ashams way to go!

 00:22:48 <vibhav> Because the timings of Asian board clash with my schedule , greg-g

 00:22:49 <ashams> bkerensa, Thanks :-)

 00:22:59 <greg-g> vibhav: ah

 00:23:04 <vibhav> you can see me at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/vibhav

 00:24:15 <greg-g> vibhav: what kind of work do you do with the Indian LoCo?

 00:24:43 <vibhav_> Sorry guys , its my connection

 00:24:45 <vibhav_> Sorry guys , its my connection

 00:25:12 <greg-g> unfortunately, no :/

 00:25:14 <vibhav> so , where were we?

 00:25:18 <greg-g> erm, oops wrong windo

 00:25:20 <greg-g> vibhav: what kind of work do you do with the Indian LoCo?

 00:25:35 <vibhav> greg-g: Translation , and converting people to Ubuntu

 00:25:43 <greg-g> does the LoCo have many events?

 00:26:08 <vibhav> It has some , but due to my studies and remote location , I cant visit them

 00:27:16 <Pendulum> vibhav: I notice you say that you don't do much on IRC, but your one testimonial mentions IRC. Is spending more time working on IRC something you're interested in doing?

 00:27:42 <cyphermox> vibhav: do you have plans to contribute (in collaboration with others) in other ways than translations?

 00:28:19 <vibhav> Pendulum: I am not good at all on helping people on IRC

 00:28:32 <vibhav> cyphermox: TEsting Ubuntu pre release images

 00:28:51 <MrChrisDruif> vibhav; working on IRC is more then "just" support/help

 00:29:54 <greg-g> vibhav: I think I missed this: when did become active with Ubuntu work? Not just as a user.

 00:30:29 <greg-g> vibhav: I think I missed this: when did become active with Ubuntu work? Not just as a user.

 00:30:34 <cyphermox> vibhav: I see you mentioned starting this alreday, what kind of testing were you doing, milestone tests?

 00:30:42 <vibhav> cyphermox: Bug testing

 00:30:56 <cyphermox> vibhav: but I mean, using the tracker?

 00:31:00 <vibhav> greg-g: I started translation about 6 months ago

 00:31:03 <vibhav> cyphermox: yes

 00:31:59 <vibhav> yes

 00:32:14 <cyphermox> ok

 00:32:57 <vibhav> But I can assure you that I translate Ubuntu very well

 00:33:03 <dinda> vibhav: why are you seeking membership at this time?

 00:33:39 <vibhav> dinda : because I have already missed 2 meetings

 00:34:01 <vibhav> You can see my profile at https://launchpad.net/~vibhavp

 00:34:02 <dinda> vibhav:  I guess I'm asking more about your motivations to be a member

 00:34:25 <vibhav> dinda: Its nice to be a recognized contributor

 00:34:39 <pangolin> Council may i make a statement?

 00:34:46 <dinda> vibhav:  do you think you will be a good advocate and representative going forward?

 00:35:19 <dinda> pangolin:  please do

 00:35:28 <pangolin> I would like to say i think vibhav is a great person and he has a lot of energy. I feel he will one day make a great ubuntu member but at this time I am not certain he has done enough with the community to merit membership. I would like to see more from him.

 00:35:48 <pangolin> that is all I wanted to say.

 00:36:00 <greg-g> thank you pangolin.

 00:36:02 <vibhav_> sorry again

 00:37:40 <cyphermox> vibhav: do you have concrete plans to revive the hindi translation efforts or help getting the LoCo team approved?

 00:37:51 <vibhav> cyphermox: YES!

 00:38:18 <cyphermox> vibhav: please tell me more ;)

 00:39:15 <vibhav> cyphermox: The Hindi Translation Team used to be alive and flourishing , but now since most of theam are elders , is dead

 00:39:29 <vibhav> The Indian LoCo's administrators are also inactive

 00:39:37 <cyphermox> but do you have friends who might want to dive in and help out?

 00:39:39 <vibhav> I am ashamed at this

 00:43:53 * txomon|home understands that vibhav _ has a lot of  illusion, but thinks you might get in touch with more of your local area partners

 00:43:54 <cyphermox> vibhav: yes, that's all fine :)

 00:43:57 <greg-g> vibhav_: helping out in other ways is also great: planning, outreach, etc

 00:44:06 <cyphermox> above all, keep up the translation work, you're doing great!

 00:48:10 <benonsoftware> I will try this year with my new school and talk to them about Ubuntun and see what happenes

 00:48:29 <greg-g> wow, going to the State gov is a pain, good on you for trying to do it!

 00:48:35 <benonsoftware> Thank you

 00:48:48 <dinda> benonsoftware:  Your wiki says you are "very active" in the Australian Loco - what kind of things have you done?

 00:48:57 <benonsoftware> I am also active in the Ubuntu-AU LoCo doing the Team Reports too

 00:49:12 <benonsoftware> I am also trying to set up a release party too at the moment

 00:49:15 <philipballew> Im here because 1. He is a all around good guy and 2 he shows the sprit of Ubuntu through his hard work and action. As a ubuntu member, I think he would make a great  member

 00:50:22 <greg-g> thank you philipballew

 00:50:36 <philipballew> no problem greg-g

 00:51:09 <JoseeAntonioR> I have attended both sessions that Ben gave, and I was impressed. He was very enthusiastic, and put a lot of effort in preparing his materials. In my opinion, he would be one of those members who are always trying to make a better community.

 01:00:56 <greg-g> #topic albrigha for membership

 01:01:03 <greg-g> please introduce yourself, albrigha

 01:01:53 <albrigha> Hello! My name is Aaron.  I've been working with Ubuntu for the past 7-8 years.  I worked on the HP Linux Imaging and Printing project where I did a lot of launchpad support as well as helping Ubuntuforum users with issues.

 01:02:50 <albrigha> I'd like to be a member to be able to participate in the direction of Ubuntu (voting), etc as well as continuing to help users with problems and working to make ubuntu amazing.

 01:03:08 <albrigha> (not that it isn't amazing now..) :)

 01:03:15 <greg-g> the HPLIP stuff was for work at a previous job?

 01:03:29 <albrigha> Yes, this is true.

 01:03:38 * greg-g is just looking at your LinkedIn :)

 01:03:38 <JHOSMAN> https://twitter.com/#!/ubuntuco/status/160165237411168258

 01:03:50 <albrigha> but during that time I also participated on ubuntuforums with helping users with other unrelated ubuntu issues.

 01:04:00 <greg-g> awesome

 01:04:40 <Pendulum> albrigha: do you have any involvement with the Oregon LoCo? (I notice Launchpad says you're a member of the group)

 01:05:17 <albrigha> I am working on being more active. I've been on the team for several years, but until we had some new management it was pretty inactive

 01:05:28 <greg-g> :)

 01:05:30 * bkerensa is Team Lead for Oregon

 01:05:32 <albrigha> It's been getting more active however, and I will be participating.

 01:05:42 <greg-g> albrigha: good deal

 01:07:45 <dinda> albrigha: any forums folks around to help support you?

 01:08:11 <albrigha> no I didn't think to have some ready.

 01:08:44 <albrigha> I do have someone from the Oregon LoCo though

 01:08:45 <albrigha> :)

 01:08:57 * bkerensa has feedback if needed

 01:10:09 <greg-g> bkerensa: please share, if other than your wiki testimonial (thanks for that!)

 01:10:21 <Pendulum> albrigha: your forum and LP answers involvement seems to not be so recent, is there a reason you're applying now?

 01:11:56 <bkerensa> greg-g: I just wanted to add that due to some previous issues with the LoCo going dormant it would have been hard for albrigha to participate for some period of time although I do see him engaging via our social networks and I'm hoping when he is able he can make it to an event (his geographical location may pose a hurdle at this time)

 01:12:24 <albrigha> Pendulum: yes, I had a wrist issue and wasn't as involved in the past year.  But I've gotten that fixed so it's much easier to be involved.  As for why now, I've missed working with Ubuntu/Linux and and as Ubuntu is a huge part of my life I want to take steps to be involved with the direction of ubuntu and to continue working in the community.

 01:13:36 <greg-g> ah, glad your wrist issue is taking care of

 01:13:38 <greg-g> taken

 01:13:57 <albrigha> greg-g: thanks :)
