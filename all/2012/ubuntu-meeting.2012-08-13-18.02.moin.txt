 18:03:15 <jdstrand> Thanks to the following individuals:

 18:03:21 <jdstrand> Scott Kitterman (ScottK) provided a debdiff for precise for Calligra (LP: #1032934)

 18:03:31 <jdstrand> Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 18:03:47 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:03:51 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:04:05 <jdstrand> I'm doing triage this week

 18:04:19 <jdstrand> I'm working on an embargoed issue

 18:04:57 <jdstrand> I'd like to finish the ever exanding list of MIR audits

 18:05:35 <jdstrand> I'd like to say I am hopeful, but quite a few got piled on last week

 18:05:50 <jdstrand> recruiting continues

 18:06:25 <jdstrand> and hopefully I'll get back to updates

 18:06:30 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 18:06:44 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 18:06:51 <mdeslaur> I'm about to publish libreoffice/openoffice updates

 18:07:09 <mdeslaur> and since feature freeze is in a week and a half, I want to continue working on my apport apparmor work items

 18:07:15 <mdeslaur> to try and get that in before then

 18:07:29 <mdeslaur> if I have time, I'll pick something else off the list

 18:07:34 <mdeslaur> that's it for me

 18:07:37 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 18:07:58 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week

 18:08:13 <sbeattie> (It'll be a bit of a short week as I'm off Friday)

 18:08:21 <mdeslaur> oh, I'm off friday too

 18:08:44 <sbeattie> I'm trying to get out from under my email backlog after being gone last week

 18:09:30 <sbeattie> I need to get on top of my apparmor work items and resurrect the updates I was working on before my holiday (libgc, openstack)

 18:09:41 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me.

 18:09:47 <sbeattie> micahg: you're up

 18:10:12 <micahg> still working on webkit, and piloting today

 18:10:42 <micahg> ran into a few bumps with various things that I might try to debug (not strictly security related)

 18:10:59 <micahg> and more mozilla pre-testing

 18:11:01 <micahg> that's it

 18:11:06 <micahg> tyhicks: you're up

 18:11:36 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place and have a short week this week (only working today and tomorrow)

 18:11:46 <tyhicks> I'm working on the xmlrpc-c update, but I doubt it will go out this week

 18:12:02 <tyhicks> I also have a few loose ends to tie up (triage of a new bug report and a patch that I need to merge) on the eCryptfs mailing list before Wednesday

 18:12:06 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 18:12:09 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 18:13:52 <jjohansen> well I will be coordinating with sbeattie on some of his apparmor WIs. I have several bugs to track down and fix so I can actually push out the latest queue of patches with the locking rework, and I hope to pick off some of the smaller, WIs this week like enabling basic netlink socket mediation

 18:14:34 <jjohansen> jdstrand: back to you

 18:15:11 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Securi

 18:15:49 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 18:16:04 <jdstrand> There are a lot of merge opportunities for packages listed in http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/. Performing these updates is a great way to help Ubuntu and bolster your developer application.

 18:16:13 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 18:16:26 <mdeslaur> I do

 18:16:50 <mdeslaur> sbeattie, jdstrand, tyhicks, jjohansen: since it's feature freeze next week, please prioritize work items that can actually be done this week

 18:17:03 <mdeslaur> I mean, that need to go in before feature freeze

 18:17:21 <mdeslaur> if there's anything that you can't do this week that needs to go in before feature freeze, please let me know

 18:17:32 <mdeslaur> so we can either postpone, or start thinking about a FFe

 18:17:45 <mdeslaur> whoops, micahg too ^

 18:18:10 <jdstrand> ack

 18:18:20 <micahg> mdeslaur: I don't think I have an WI tied to the release that involve features

 18:18:30 <mdeslaur> cool.

 18:18:41 <mdeslaur> and now, back to Jamie:

 18:19:45 <jdstrand> anything else people would like to discuss?

 18:21:05 <jdstrand> mdeslaur, sbeattie, micahg, tyhicks, jjohansen: thanks!
