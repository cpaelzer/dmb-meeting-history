 16:02:32 <jamespage> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:35 <jamespage> none

 16:02:37 <jamespage> \o/

 16:02:44 <jamespage> #topic Quantal Development

 16:02:50 <jamespage> #topic Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:03:19 <Daviey> It's mostly MIR bugs which are causing woe

 16:03:21 <jamespage> So we have quite a few MIR's to support cep work

 16:03:36 <jamespage> bug 1017972 1017978 1022493

 16:03:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017972 in libunwind (Ubuntu) "[MIR] google-perftools, libunwind" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017972

 16:03:43 <Daviey> jamespage: perhaps someone should try to interface closer with the MIR team to get these progressing ?

 16:03:58 <jamespage> Daviey, as they are all mine I will do that

 16:04:09 <Daviey> jamespage: super!

 16:04:14 <jamespage> and then

 16:04:17 <jamespage> bug 974584

 16:04:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu Quantal) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 16:04:29 <Daviey> hallyn: ^

 16:04:40 <jamespage> #action jamespage to checkin with MIR team on expected review timescales for server MIR's

 16:04:40 * meetingology jamespage to checkin with MIR team on expected review timescales for server MIR's

 16:04:45 <hallyn> Daviey: should be fixed ind ebian

 16:04:47 <hallyn> in debian

 16:04:56 <zul> there is quantum/quantumclient MIRs as well

 16:05:17 <jamespage> zul: please make sure you subscribe ubuntu-server-release

 16:05:29 <Daviey> zul: can you action following them up?

 16:05:30 <zul> jamespage: ack

 16:05:54 <zul> Daviey: i tried to get them moving today but no one from the MIR answered my query

 16:05:56 <jamespage> #action zul to make sure relevant MIR bugs have ubuntu-server-release subscribed

 16:05:56 * meetingology zul to make sure relevant MIR bugs have ubuntu-server-release subscribed

 16:05:56 <Daviey> jamespage: well, technically ubuntu-server-release is for issues we are blocking on.. MIR bugs mostly block on others, no?

 16:06:13 <jamespage> Daviey, I don't see much differentiation

 16:06:32 <Daviey> jamespage: Well, there is a separate section on the report specifically for tracking MIR's

 16:06:40 <Daviey> (without us having to subscribe ubuntu-server*)

 16:06:43 <jamespage> Daviey, oh - I see

 16:07:04 <jamespage> Daviey, what magic makes things appear their?

 16:07:28 <Daviey> jamespage: that is for packages that we are bug subscribers for and has ~ubuntu-mir subscribed to the bug, and not Fix'd

 16:07:32 <Daviey> ie, just works.

 16:07:56 <jamespage> Daviey, OK - so we just need to sub ~ubuntu-server to those packages then

 16:08:03 <jamespage> zul: ^^ got that?

 16:08:08 <jamespage> I'll update mine as well

 16:08:09 <Daviey> yah.. which is usually a prerequisite for MIR

 16:08:14 <zul> jamespage: yeah

 16:08:17 <jamespage> Daviey, ack

 16:09:21 <jamespage> hallyn: re bug 974584 - can I assign that bug to you or is there someone else more appropriate?

 16:09:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu Quantal) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 16:09:41 <hallyn> jamespage: assigning me wouldn't help :)  it's fixedin debian, just needs to be merged

 16:09:44 <hallyn> i just commented on the bug

 16:10:01 <hallyn> (needs to be merged, and i don't have upload rights)

 16:10:05 <Daviey> jamespage: hallyn is mostly on plus1 for now.. better someone else

 16:10:22 <jamespage> hallyn, ah - rightoh - its actually sysvinit not lxc - my mistake

 16:10:51 <jamespage> zul: bug 1020313

 16:10:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1020313 in horizon (Ubuntu) "openstack-dashboard hijacks the web root" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020313

 16:11:12 <jamespage> OK to sweep that up in the next set of updates?

 16:11:49 <zul> jamespage: is that in precise?

 16:12:02 <Daviey> I don't think we can reasonably SRU that

 16:12:14 <jamespage> Daviey, I agree

 16:12:32 <Daviey> soren: ^^

 16:12:58 <Daviey> next?

 16:13:02 <jamespage> OK _ while we figure that out

 16:13:16 <jamespage> Still have a couple of FTBFS issue we are tracking

 16:13:29 <jamespage> I know the genshi one is not moving forward upstream

 16:13:42 <jamespage> so we may need to spend some time working a patch ourselves

 16:13:51 <jamespage> so if anyone wants to volunteer....

 16:14:08 <jamespage> other than that ... moving on

 16:14:11 <jamespage> #topic Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:14:28 <jamespage> bah wrong ling

 16:14:29 <jamespage> link

 16:14:33 <arosales> trend line is still a bit off

 16:14:40 <jamespage> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:14:46 <zul> oooh...lets do the time war again

 16:14:53 <jamespage> lol

 16:15:05 <arosales> Daviey: did you mention we need re-classify topics?

 16:15:12 <rbasak> smoser: I've been meaning to suggest that we redo the work items for the apt blueprint once we have feedback

 16:15:20 <Daviey> arosales: no

 16:15:42 <arosales> or reorder BPs under topics

 16:15:46 <arosales> or neither :-)

 16:15:59 <smoser> rbasak, that seems reasonable.

 16:16:12 <Daviey> -Action arosales, update the topics/blueprints? :)

 16:16:40 <jamespage> Daviey, arosales: please can we understand the context for this change?

 16:17:10 * Daviey hands the mic to arosales.

 16:17:25 <arosales> Daviey: I already put the dependencies on the BPs

 16:17:42 <arosales> perhaps I classified then under the incorrect topic though

 16:18:12 <arosales> I'll take an action to get this straigned out and get the trend line to track our work correctly

 16:18:54 <jamespage> #action arosales to sort out blueprints and get the trend line working correctly

 16:18:54 * meetingology arosales to sort out blueprints and get the trend line working correctly

 16:18:56 <jamespage> ta

 16:19:26 <Daviey> lets have a @daily reset-trend-line.py cronjob

 16:19:44 <jamespage> I'm not going to focus on any specific blueprints; but I would recommend everyone review ~weekly

 16:19:54 <jamespage> I've also been using the +upcomingwork view in Launchpad

 16:19:56 <jamespage> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+upcomingwork

 16:19:59 <jamespage> for example

 16:20:18 <jamespage> which gives you more of a time based view of whats next....

 16:20:34 <jamespage> anyone have anything else for blueprint status?

 16:20:39 <jamespage> .....

 16:20:42 <jamespage> ....

 16:20:44 <jamespage> ...

 16:20:46 <jamespage> ..

 16:20:47 <jamespage> .

 16:20:51 <jamespage> nope

 16:20:52 <jamespage> OK

 16:20:58 <Daviey> hometime \o/

 16:21:00 <jamespage> #topic 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:21:33 <smoser> i believe i was probably supposed to have done something here. i think i said i'd look at our list of items. but I have not.

 16:21:35 * ScottK uploaded postfix 2.9.3 for a MRE SRU yesterday.  Waiting for someone else in ubuntu-sru to accept it.

 16:21:36 <jamespage> We have managed to push few quite a few SRU's

 16:21:52 <jamespage> thanks ScottK

 16:22:02 <jamespage> *push through

 16:22:15 <jamespage> smoser - lets do that tomorrow

 16:22:32 <jamespage> #action smoser and jamespage to review and assign SRU bug across team.

 16:22:32 * meetingology smoser and jamespage to review and assign SRU bug across team.

 16:22:33 <smoser> jamespage, ok.

 16:22:55 <smoser> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/rls-p-tracking-bugs.html is the/one list, and as you can see, server has a nice long list of bugs

 16:22:57 <smoser> wee!

 16:23:29 <jamespage> smoser: most of those bugs are also on

 16:23:38 <jamespage> http://people.canonical.com/~jamespage/server-sru/precise-sru.html

 16:23:57 <jamespage> maas and juju specifically have a large number of unassigned high priority items

 16:24:13 <jamespage> anyway - looks like folk will have bugs coming their way tomorrow onwards....

 16:24:16 <zul> bugs are overated

 16:24:28 <jamespage> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:24:39 <jamespage> any events in the next two weeks we should be aware of?

 16:25:04 <arosales> OSCON coming up on the 16th

 16:25:13 <arosales> m_3 and jcastro attending

 16:25:21 <jimbaker> i will also be at oscon

 16:25:37 <jamespage> a veritable server-team fest!

 16:25:43 <jamespage> OK

 16:25:48 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:25:54 <jamespage> hggdh, around for an update?

 16:26:44 <jamespage> ...

 16:26:45 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:26:49 <jamespage> smb?

 16:26:49 <smb> yup

 16:26:52 <smb> So I have been chasing some quantal regression of an older (b44) nic, trying to get kexec/kdump working in precise/quantal, chasing some 32bit Xen HVM problem and err, that might be all. Something else I should be aware (iow questions)? Oh, and /me being in Portland, OR next week.

 16:26:54 <smb> ..

 16:27:44 <jamespage> any questions for smb?

 16:28:13 <jamespage> nope - next!

 16:28:23 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:28:27 <rbasak> I've been working on a hacky patch against MAAS trunk that will make it provision ARM machines. The idea is that this can eventually be adapted into first class support. The patch is currently up-to-date against MAAS trunk, and I'm just waiting on the last cobbler-replacement pieces to land.

 16:28:36 <rbasak> Nothing else to report.

 16:28:38 <rbasak> Any questions for me?

 16:29:05 <jamespage> rbasak, I have a question - would it be possible to get the openvswitch kernel module enabled for the ARM kernels?

 16:29:24 <jamespage> I believe its upstream for the 3.4 series we are currently using

 16:29:32 <rbasak> That's something I'll have to ask of the kernel team

 16:29:48 <jamespage> rbasak, that would be helpful (only hit this today)

 16:30:11 <rbasak> In quantal? Or do you need a precise SRU?

 16:30:21 <jamespage> #action rbasak to find out whether openvswitch module can be enabled for quantal ARM kernels

 16:30:21 * meetingology rbasak to find out whether openvswitch module can be enabled for quantal ARM kernels

 16:30:27 <jamespage> rbasak, quantal is OK

 16:30:33 <rbasak> This is for the openstack module I presume? I forget its name

 16:30:41 <jamespage> quantum

 16:30:46 <rbasak> Yeah that's it

 16:30:51 <rbasak> OK I'll find out

 16:31:04 <jamespage> plus openvswitch is way cooler than doing old style bridging... :-)

 16:31:12 <rbasak> apw: ^^? :)

 16:31:17 <jamespage> any other questions for rbasak?

 16:31:33 <rbasak> jamespage: which kernels in particular?

 16:31:43 <rbasak> jamespage: omap4, armadaxp, highbank, all of the above? :)

 16:31:47 <Daviey> rbasak: whilst i remember, shall we have a quick catchup tomorrow morning?

 16:31:48 <jamespage> rbasak, all of the above

 16:31:53 <rbasak> :)

 16:31:59 <rbasak> Daviey: sure

 16:32:11 <jamespage> OK

 16:32:13 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 16:32:27 <jamespage> anyone have anything for open discussion?

 16:32:30 <Daviey> nope

 16:32:53 <jamespage> right-oh

 16:32:55 <jamespage> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:33:16 <zul> jamespage: we should be able to test if the dkms modules build

 16:33:24 <jamespage> zul: it does not

 16:33:35 <zul> oh...poop

 16:33:49 <jamespage> July 17th 2012, 1600 UTC right here

 16:33:58 <jamespage> until then...

 16:34:00 <jamespage> #endmeeting
