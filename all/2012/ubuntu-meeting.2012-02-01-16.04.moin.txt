 16:05:17 <cjwatson> Mostly this week I have been working on upgrade bugs of one kind or another (bug 917173 and bug 922485 in the apt resolver, which I blogged about; bug 924079, which I posted to ubuntu-devel about today).  More of this probably to come; we are not short of upgrade bugs.

 16:05:22 <cjwatson> Fixed mirror handling for ports installs (bug 919356).

 16:05:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917173 in apt (Ubuntu Oneiric) "lucid -> precise upgrade failed: Resolver failed to calculate the upgrade - dpkg-dev held back" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917173

 16:05:28 <cjwatson> Fixed netcfg and ubiquity fallout from resolvconf.

 16:05:34 <cjwatson> Fixed ubiquity fallout from dbus-python 1.0.0 (bug 922988).

 16:05:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922988 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "ubiquity crashed with UnicodeDecodeError in decode_ssid(): 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 0: unexpected end of data" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922988

 16:05:36 <cjwatson> Fixed casper to set up ubuntustudio groups properly, then fixed fallout from that for everything else when preseeded (oops).

 16:05:46 <cjwatson> ..

 16:06:04 <ev> - Released a new version of whoopsie-daisy (the crash reporting daemon) into

 16:06:04 <ev> the archive. Still waiting on approval for MIR bug 913694.

 16:06:05 <ev> - Added retracing support to whoopsie-dasiy. It's currently partially broken

 16:06:05 <ev> as the stack traces change slightly with each new retrace, so a new

 16:06:05 <ev> stacktrace and stacktrace hash gets written to the columnfamily every time.

 16:06:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 913694 in whoopsie-daisy (Ubuntu) "[MIR] whoopsie-daisy" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/913694

 16:06:08 <barry> ouch, sorry about 922988

 16:06:12 <ev> - Added a small purge tool for flushing the message queue.

 16:06:12 <ev> - Created the control center preferences page after spending an indordinate

 16:06:12 <ev> amount of time digesting the gnome-control-center API that they helpfully

 16:06:13 <ev> made private, forcing us to patch it back in (without documentation).

 16:06:13 <ev> - Short week; vacation on Monday.

 16:06:22 <ev> - Added initial policy kit permission support in the preferences dialog.

 16:06:22 <ev> - Work on the DBus daemon (using GDBus' code generation) for the preferences

 16:06:22 <ev> dialog backend.

 16:06:23 <ev> - More work on the DBus daemon. Investigating how to best enable/disable the

 16:06:23 <ev> upstart job.

 16:06:26 <ev> (done)

 16:06:27 <cjwatson> barry: couldn't quite decide if that was a dbus-python bug or not ... feel free to think about it :)

 16:06:34 <barry> will do!

 16:06:48 <cjwatson> the fix was str() -> chr(int())

 16:07:04 * doko_ moves to the end of the list

 16:07:12 <doko_> stgraber, please go on

 16:14:58 <slangasek> ..

 16:15:10 <cjwatson> re bug 922330, it's time-machine territory now, but I wonder if we should make wubi put its version in HTTP headers so that we at least theoretically might have some way to fix this kind of thing in future ...

 16:15:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922330 in Wubi "Wubi.exe from 11.10 disc installs 12.04 snapshot." [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922330

 16:15:13 <doko_> - more gcc-4.7 fixes and packaging updates

 16:15:13 <doko_> - eglibc updates, the dlopen crash in gdk-pixbug-loaders on amd64 is fixed

 16:15:13 <doko_> - really export the sunrpc symbols in libc6

 16:15:13 <doko_> - prepared and started the test precise test rebuild

 16:15:13 <doko_> - catch up on MIR's

 16:16:26 <jodh> slangasek: weeeeell. took a lot of work to find it. we were closing the fds correctly, *but* the fd number persisted in an nih watch such that when nih looked for fd activity, it saw the (now invalid) fd and returned EBADF. repeatedly :)

 16:16:41 <bdmurray> cjwatson: I dont' know how people find wubi but putting a new wubi.exe at http://people.canonical.com/~evand/wubi/oneiric/ might help

 16:16:53 <cjwatson> bdmurray: the bug reports that it came off the CD image

 16:17:13 <slangasek> jodh: doh... :)

 16:17:26 <bdmurray> cjwatson: okay, yes but I tested it by just downloading 245.exe

 16:17:29 <cjwatson> although I agree that a build of r247 there wouldn't go amiss - ev?  I'm surprised we didn't have one there actually

 16:18:16 <ev> I think we didn't put a newer build on the CD because it was determined that they wouldn't be using the download a compressed disk image path when running off the CD

 16:18:22 <ev> as this was an 11th hour release thing

 16:18:24 <ev> if memory serves

 16:18:42 <ev> so the bug, as I've just commented in the report, is that it's going down the download path at all

 16:18:47 <cjwatson> ev: ok, but I wonder how we were expecting them to get it off the website if you didn't publish a build

 16:19:17 <cjwatson> it was all a rush that morning

 16:20:06 <ev> I'm confused. Why would we be expecting them to get it off the website?

 16:21:22 <bdmurray> Isn't that where http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer takes you?

 16:21:59 <cjwatson> well, it sends you to a wubi.exe from a mirror of releases.ubuntu.com I think, but the executable does need to come from somewhere

 16:22:21 <cjwatson> and the source for that is ev's people.c.c directory

 16:23:51 <cjwatson> so, yes, I think anyone going through the website path is broken right now

 16:24:14 <ev> for 12.04

 16:24:23 <ev> not for 11.10, unless I'm missing some part of this conversation

 16:24:26 <bdmurray> no, for 11.10

 16:24:30 <cjwatson> what he said

 16:24:43 <slangasek> I've lost the thread here; that bug is about a wubi copied off of a CD, I thought?

 16:25:15 <cjwatson> the problem is that 11.10's wubi.exe uses a URL for the disk image which now refers to a daily build of precise

 16:25:29 <bdmurray> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/wubi/trunk/view/245/data/isolist.ini

 16:25:52 <cjwatson> we cannot fix this for wubi copied off CDs, but the same problem currently goes for people downloading it from the redirect on www.ubuntu.com (which I think is for 11.10)

 16:25:53 <ev> in that version

 16:25:54 <bdmurray> and the wubi.exe on the cd is the same as the one you download at ubuntu.com...windows-installer

 16:26:03 <ev> but I could've sworn that we published a later version on the website...

 16:26:25 <cjwatson> ev: so could I, but I can't see how we would have done without there being a build in your people.c.c directory

 16:26:42 <bdmurray> I checked the md5sum of wubi.exe at http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/ and it was rev 245

 16:27:08 <cjwatson> yes, I just did as well

 16:27:14 <cjwatson> matches wubi-r245-signed.exe

 16:27:35 <cjwatson> so I think we need a new build, get it signed, get it tested, push to releases.u.c/oneiric/

 16:27:41 <ev> yeah

 16:28:42 <slangasek> ev: can you take care of that?

 16:28:49 <ev> yup, on it

 16:28:51 <slangasek> thanks

 16:29:05 <slangasek> there's another wubi bug that turned up in milestone testing which I suspect comes down to the same thing

 16:29:22 <slangasek> bug #924752

 16:29:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924752 in Wubi "wubi r255 - Ubuntu Desktop failed to install from disk image - wrong download url" [Critical,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924752

 16:29:43 <cjwatson> no, not quite, I asked ev about that

 16:29:44 <ev> yup, I'm committing a fix for that in about 25 seconds

 16:29:47 <cjwatson> heh

 16:29:50 <slangasek> ah, ok :)

 16:30:07 <cjwatson> actually does that mean r247 wouldn't work for oneiric either?

 16:30:07 <slangasek> segging into the next topic...

 16:30:19 <cjwatson> maybe we do need the same fix there, since it was a failure to fall back to diskimage2

 16:31:54 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Alpha-2

 16:32:32 <slangasek> since I'm minding the crank for this one, if you have any bugs that you think are milestone critical, please let me know :)

 16:32:56 <slangasek> there was a casper upload for a preseed issue (thanks, cjwatson)

 16:33:08 <slangasek> and it would be good to have a fixed wubi in - sounds like that's on track

 16:33:33 <slangasek> any other landmines in the alpha prep?

 16:33:59 <ev> new wubi is up

 16:34:23 <slangasek> yay

 16:34:43 <cjwatson> slangasek: wonder if we should release-note something about amd64 upgrades (cf. -devel)

 16:34:48 <slangasek> cjwatson, ev: did Israel get sorted?

 16:34:51 <cjwatson> no

 16:34:59 <cjwatson> I -> beta-1'ed that

 16:35:01 <slangasek> ok

 16:35:10 <slangasek> do you think that warrants a release note too?

 16:35:21 <cjwatson> probably, to stave off pitchforkage

 16:35:46 <cjwatson> ev: (wubi branch doesn't seem up to date though)

 16:36:18 <ev> fixed

 16:36:20 <ev> apols

 16:36:49 <slangasek> cjwatson: sorry, was that -devel or #-devel for the context?

 16:36:56 <slangasek> on amd64 upgrades

 16:37:32 <cjwatson> ev: aha, yes

 16:37:40 <cjwatson> slangasek: both :-)  the list has more exposition though

 16:38:01 <cjwatson> but briefly any oneiric amd64 system with ia32-libs needs some work to be upgradeable cleanly to precise

 16:38:09 <cjwatson> at least afaics

 16:38:13 <slangasek> cjwatson: oh right, the date changed so I'm looking in the wrong archive yay

 16:38:54 <cjwatson> I think it is fixable but not before tomorrow

 16:38:55 <slangasek> yes, I agree that sounds like it should be release noted

 16:39:05 <slangasek> what's our recommendation there?

 16:39:35 <slangasek> for users trying to upgrade, I mean

 16:39:57 <cjwatson> install apt first, if possible

 16:40:26 <cjwatson> (from precise)

 16:40:32 <cjwatson> that strategy worked for RAOF's system

 16:40:33 <slangasek> which is stepping pretty far outside of the update-manager workflow.  Do we want to give them a pointer in the release notes to the launchpad page for a direct download from the librarian?

 16:40:52 <slangasek> or do we assume "if you're running 64-bit and upgrading to an alpha, you can figure it out" :)

 16:41:02 <cjwatson> well, the list thread was about fixing the update-manager workflow :)  I don't know that it has to be polished for a milestone

 16:41:21 <cjwatson> it wouldn't just be a single download since you need new libapt-pkg as well

 16:41:35 <slangasek> yep

 16:41:54 <cjwatson> we could publish a python-apt program that did it ... but well, not sure it's worth it

 16:41:58 <slangasek> cjwatson: can you take the action to get this release-noted in some fashion?

 16:42:05 <cjwatson> yes

 16:42:11 <slangasek> thanks

 16:44:10 <ev> cheers

 16:44:55 <bdmurray> I ran acrss bug 550717 recently

 16:44:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 550717 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[Lucid] two accessiblity related bug with Ubiquity, with easy to fix" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/550717

 16:45:50 <slangasek> doko_: btw, where are we with java-access-bridge switching off of at-spi?  the task is assigned to TheMuso and targeted to a2, but it looks like desktop team thinks the remaining changes needed are in openjdk-6?

 16:45:55 * cjwatson giggles manically at "accessibility" and "easy" in the same sentence

 16:46:24 <slangasek> as easy as 1, 2, shift+ctrl+meta+backtick

 16:46:38 <doko_> slangasek, not yet there, have committed it, but it crashes, need to look at it

 16:46:45 <slangasek> doko_: alrighty

 16:47:16 <cjwatson> I think half of that bug is probably fixed and the other half of the suggested change isn't something we'd be prepared to do

 16:47:21 <cjwatson> I'll look into it and leave a comment

 16:47:49 <bdmurray> okay thanks

 16:48:29 <bdmurray> Then bug 852181 isn't about one of our packages, I think, but is easily confused for one

 16:48:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 852181 in indicator-session (Ubuntu Oneiric) "Wrong indication again about updates" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/852181

 16:48:51 <bdmurray> Its about apt watcher in indicator session

 16:50:38 <slangasek> somewhere between update-notifier and indicator-session, I guess

 16:52:43 <slangasek> bdmurray: given that I don't think any of us have the spare bandwidth to dive into indicator-session to fix it, not sure what else we can do there?

 16:53:03 <bdmurray> I'll see if there are more duplicates about that bug hiding in update-notifier or update-manager to see if there are lots

 16:53:17 <slangasek> makes sense

 16:53:38 <bdmurray> Okay, that's that then

 16:53:39 * slangasek adds a tag to the bug too ;)

 16:53:45 <slangasek> bdmurray: ok, thanks!

 16:53:47 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB
