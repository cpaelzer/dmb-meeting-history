 15:02:26 <cjwatson> I think I remembered the set of people who're off today correctly

 15:02:37 <xnox> i am first for the first time

 15:02:39 <xnox> ubiquity-lvm auto install works with UI, apart from the install fails

 15:02:39 <xnox> due to new bug #1020574

 15:02:39 <xnox> did patch piloting, see report on the mailing list

 15:02:39 <xnox> got access to HPCloud together with a few other devs, started to

 15:02:39 <xnox> jujufy collab-qa/cloud-scripts.git for launching archive rebuilds. The

 15:02:41 <xnox> goal is full archive rebuild in 8 hours (excluding libreoffice).

 15:02:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1020574 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "SystemError: Broken pipe while installing language packs" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020574

 15:02:43 <xnox> got panda board, didn't install it

 15:02:45 <xnox> two packages left for boost1.49: player (quick fix), and ball (FTBFS

 15:02:47 <xnox> with gcc4.7 and gcc4.6, and python-moc)

 15:03:04 <cjwatson> lvm auto install> well done, good start :)

 15:03:10 <cjwatson> (is there a branch somewhere for it?)

 15:03:15 * xnox should push

 15:03:25 <xnox> after removing swear words from commit messages

 15:03:35 <xnox> i am in the office today

 15:03:49 <xnox> and will be working with mpt for the second part of the week on the RAID and LUKS design

 15:06:48 <cjwatson> Did the half-started pile of branches I had lying around for britney help at all?

 15:07:22 <infinity> cjwatson: I've not actually looked at your half-started branches yet.  Nor do I remember where you half put them. ;)

 15:07:45 <cjwatson> lillypilly:~cjwatson/proposed-migration/

 15:07:48 <infinity> (Yesterday was the first chance I really had to dive in much at all, now that I no longer have minions interrupting me)

 15:07:51 <cjwatson> All my state was there

 15:08:10 <cjwatson> Well, if you want to pair-hack on it for a while at some point, I'm available - or not, if that'd be a distraction :)

 15:08:12 <infinity> Shiny.  Will look when awake.

 15:09:17 <cjwatson> (best compose key sequence evah)

 15:09:59 <ogra_> done:

 15:10:00 <ogra_> * tried to debug plymouth issues on various arm images (ongoing)

 15:10:29 <ogra_> (your preferred utf-8 end sign here)

 15:11:01 <jodh> * boot/upstart: stateful re-exec work:

 15:11:01 <jodh> - Made code 64-bit safe (time-consuming due to awkwardness of JSON-C).

 15:11:01 <jodh> - Currently working on Job serialisation and all its associated

 15:11:01 <jodh> tentacles.

 15:11:04 <jodh> * misc: on holiday Friday 6th and next week.

 15:11:07 <jodh> ⟿

 15:11:11 <jodh> 

 15:11:19 <stgraber> cjwatson: good to hear the -proposed change landed, I'll test a desktop image later this week so we can get ubiquity out of proposed

 15:11:26 <xnox> ogra_: (in text2speech audio description ;-) )

 15:11:45 <cjwatson> stgraber: Yeah, I've tried a couple of times but for some reason was having trouble getting it to use a proxy at all

 15:11:49 <ogra_> *g*

 15:12:38 <xnox> cjwatson: can't you pressed the proxy via apt.conf setting or via debconf.

 15:12:40 <xnox> ?

 15:12:46 <cjwatson> Yes, I did

 15:12:50 <xnox> =(

 15:12:50 <xnox> ok

 15:12:58 <cjwatson> Something was weird and I didn't get a chance to investigate properly

 15:13:13 <jodh> ogra_: what are the plymouth issues out of interest?

 15:13:29 <stgraber> IIRC ubiquity is supposed to pick it up from gsettings, but that's a part of the code that I touched quite a while ago and isn't widely tested (if at all)

 15:13:29 <cjwatson> I had a suspicion maybe the python-apt code in scripts/{plugin,}install wasn't picking up the setting or something, but it was just a guess

 15:13:47 <ogra_> jodh, one is an issue with the omap4 kernel providing a drm device but not attaching it to any output ...

 15:13:51 <cjwatson> Maybe setting it in the live session's apt.conf as well as preseeding it would help, for the purposes of getting this verified

 15:14:14 <ogra_> jodh, the other is still unidentified (still trying to fix the kernel issue on ac100 first)

 15:15:07 * xnox so it's the network's transparent proxy which is borked... since there is no obvious way to force proxy usage. Can it be done outside of the VM for example..

 15:15:22 <cjwatson> #topic bugs

 15:15:54 <cjwatson> Steve asked me if we could have a quick look through some of the 12.04.1 targeted bugs and make sure that (a) any that should be on target are (b) any that we shouldn't care about aren't on the list

 15:16:23 <xnox> from the subset of ~foundations subscribed/assigned/personal?

 15:16:31 <cjwatson> stgraber: Does https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+bugs?field.milestone=49926 match the list you're working from?

 15:16:34 <xnox> or just all the 12.04.1?

 15:16:46 <cjwatson> xnox: the above is the URL Steve gave me

 15:16:48 <stgraber> cjwatson: I guess I'll simply make that perl script the transparent proxy for that VM, that's a pretty simple iptables rule

 15:17:05 <cjwatson> stgraber: That should work, yeah

 15:17:08 <stgraber> cjwatson: yep, that's the one

 15:17:20 <cjwatson> I picked out a few categories from that

 15:17:48 <cjwatson> There's the multi-arch bugs, which IIRC stokachu has moderately well in hand, although he's presumably out celebrating independence today

 15:18:05 <cjwatson> (bug 977940, bug 977964, bug 977947, bug 977952, bug 977959)

 15:18:51 <cjwatson> There's the bugs that I put in category "xnox"

 15:18:52 <cjwatson> bug 978012, bug 1002357, bug 1009973, bug 1017407, bug 942106, bug 968074, bug 969384

 15:18:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 978012 in e2fsprogs (Ubuntu Precise) "Please SRU micro bug fix release of e2fsprogs 1.42.4-3ubuntu1 (main) from Quantal (main)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/978012

 15:19:33 <xnox> cjwatson: so the mdadm SRU for all of these got rejected, because of being overenthusiastic.

 15:19:39 <cjwatson> and there's everything else

 15:19:40 <cjwatson> bug 523896, bug 683640, bug 946406, bug 970638, bug 974584, bug 994575, bug 1003842, bug 1006898, bug 1017001

 15:20:01 <xnox> cjwatson: the e2fsprogs SRU is pending review from infinity, but it potentially also needs cleaning up.

 15:20:12 <cjwatson> And apparently ubottu has rate-limited me, sigh

 15:20:38 <cjwatson> xnox: So are each of the non-microrelease bugs on mdadm still good targets, or are you going to pare that down?

 15:20:48 <cjwatson> As in, is it a matter of backporting specific patches?

 15:21:07 <stgraber> bug 946406 might be related to bug 985065

 15:21:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 946406 in casper (Ubuntu Quantal) "suspect race condition Keyboard layout, oem-config not set on persistent USB image" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/946406

 15:21:48 <cjwatson> Meh, I'll take that psmisc one, since I've been uploading the quantal merges anyway

 15:22:38 <infinity> It looks straightforward.

 15:23:03 <xnox> cjwatson: yes they are. i need to revert a couple of patches from the micro-release of mdadm and it should be good to go.

 15:23:26 <xnox> those that change interfaces.

 15:23:57 <cjwatson> stgraber: There's a cluster of four dnsmasq and resolvconf bugs; are you happy with all of those being listed?

 15:24:29 <ev> cjwatson: I've tidied up https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity

 15:25:01 <stgraber> cjwatson: I need to go through them but it's very unlikely we'll fix them as they'd be pretty significant behaviour changes, IIRC most of them are linked to NM and so should be somewhere on cyphermox's list

 15:25:32 <cjwatson> OK, I'll assume you'll shift the milestone if you nack them, then

 15:25:42 <stgraber> yep

 15:25:59 <cjwatson> Sigh, LP's assignee listings are unhelpful for this list

 15:26:06 <cjwatson> (some of the Nones are lies)

 15:26:39 <stgraber> I'll try to do some nagging this week, making sure the various teams assign the bugs they're planning to work on or move the bugs to another milestone

 15:26:53 <cjwatson> Does anyone know about bug 683640?  It's currently milestoned for 12.04.1 and also rls-q-notfixing, which seems like an unlikely combination

 15:27:07 <xnox> cjwatson: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestone/ubuntu-12.04.1

 15:27:13 <xnox> but it's not the whole truth

 15:27:56 <cjwatson> Right, I know there are various possibilities but I explicitly want to work off the same list as Steve so that I'm not missing things

 15:28:13 <xnox> ok

 15:28:30 <cjwatson> Bug 974584 (sysvinit) and bug 523896 (shadow) appear to need assignees; any volunteers?

 15:28:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu Quantal) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 15:29:47 <infinity> I can try to poke at the shadow bug, though I have some eglibc SRUs that trump it for urgency.

 15:29:50 <stgraber> the sysvinit one is being worked on by slangasek/hallyn

 15:30:32 <xnox> ev: bug 994921

 15:30:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 994921 in apport (Ubuntu Quantal) "'ubuntu-bug /var/crash/app.crash' (and even more so, 'apport-cli -c /var/crash/app.crash') should still allow manual bug filing in stable releases" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/994921

 15:31:26 <ev> xnox: cheers

 15:32:05 <cjwatson> stgraber: Neither of whom is assigned, but OK ...

 15:32:29 <cjwatson> Ah, he's assigned to the lxc task, not the sysvinit one

 15:32:30 <cjwatson> OK

 15:33:38 <stgraber> cjwatson: yeah, I'll poke him for a status update on that bug tomorrow and to figure out who of slangasek and hallyn is actually working on it

 15:34:15 <stgraber> IIRC there's a fix that landed in Debian (or in the vcs branch) but that slangasek then considered wrong, so it's still being discussed

 15:39:18 <cjwatson> ev: wiki> thanks, much better

 15:39:31 <ev> cjwatson: sure thing
