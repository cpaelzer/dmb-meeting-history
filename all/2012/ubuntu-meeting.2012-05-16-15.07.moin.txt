 15:17:24 <cjwatson> stokachu: Anything you'd like to note for this week?  Sorry, kind of sprung this on you :)

 15:17:49 <stokachu> cjwatson: Probably have some SRU's to post next week (i just created a couple yesterday)

 15:19:38 <cjwatson> OK - you can keep an eye on how other people are doing status dumps here and work out your own style from that :)

 15:19:39 <stokachu> I do have a merge proposal that was reviewed by bdmurray https://code.launchpad.net/~adam-stokes/ubuntu/quantal/libgcrypt11/libgcrypt-fix-423252/+merge/105863 that i'd like to get done before i leave on vacation this friday

 15:20:19 <stokachu> cool yea, seems like everyone is just pasting from a text file?

 15:20:26 <cjwatson> anyone want to take that?  looks fairly short

 15:20:26 * xnox nods.

 15:20:31 <cjwatson> stokachu: yep

 15:20:35 <stokachu> ok cool

 15:20:39 <cjwatson> "here's one I made earlier"

 15:21:12 <stokachu> if i can get the merge proposal finished I can create SRU's for review next week

 15:22:00 <cjwatson> I'll have a look after the meeting, then

 15:22:04 <cjwatson> ev:

 15:22:07 <infinity> I've got it.

 15:22:07 <ev> hi, sorry

 15:22:14 <infinity> Or, rather, I'm already looking.

 15:22:17 <cjwatson> infinity: oh good, thanks

 15:22:22 <stokachu> cool thanks

 15:22:22 <ev> - Short week; UDS through Friday and travel on Sunday/Monday.

 15:22:22 <ev> - Got all the work items in for all the crash database specs. Still need to

 15:22:24 <ev> write additional wiki page specifications where necessary.

 15:22:25 <ev> - Built a Tarmac bot in the Canonistack (to eventually be replaced with

 15:22:26 <ev> james_w's juju charm) for running the whoopsie test suite on approved merge

 15:22:27 <ev> proposals and landing the branches.

 15:22:29 <ev> 

 15:22:30 <ev> I'll also set this up for daisy and errors once I set up a more permanent

 15:22:33 <ev> Cassandra instance in the Canonistack, or create some magic around juju

 15:22:35 <ev> relations as part of the test suite (verify_command =

 15:22:36 <ev> CASSANDRA_IP=$(relation-get addr) make check)

 15:22:37 <ev> - Modified whoopsie to fall back to SHA-512 hashing the MAC address of the

 15:22:38 <ev> first non-loopback device when a system UUID is not present.

 15:22:38 <ev> - Finished charming (ugh) daisy, the backend service to the Ubuntu error

 15:22:39 <ev> tracker:

 15:22:40 <ev> http://code.launchpad.net/~ev/charms/precise/daisy/trunk

 15:22:41 <ev> - Started charming (ugh) the retracers. Still need to charm errors.ubuntu.com.

 15:22:43 <ev> - Created a branch out of my existing Debian packaging and set up a source

 15:22:44 <ev> package recipe. This resolves issues I was having in being able to provide

 15:22:45 <ev> packages for multiple releases (most of the infrastructure is lucid, but the

 15:22:47 <ev> retracers run on precise).

 15:22:48 <ev> - Started reworking the mean time between failures backend code into a simpler

 15:22:49 <ev> "total crashes for the day / total users for the day" chart. Filed an RT for

 15:22:50 <ev> the initial deployment.

 15:22:51 <ev> (done)

 15:23:35 <cjwatson> Short week: UDS then swapped bank holiday.

 15:23:35 <cjwatson> Pushed pykde4 the rest of the way up the hill for Python 3: yofel uploaded it.  Uploaded pyicu Python 3 port.  ubiquity will be uploaded shortly once I've had a chance to do a final build test.

 15:23:40 <cjwatson> Transferring work items into LP and other writeup-related work.

 15:23:42 <cjwatson> Attempted to get a working setup of the Debian testing migration code for quantal-proposed => quantal.  Somewhat harder than expected so will take a while longer.

 15:23:45 <cjwatson> Finished off LP branch for per-packageset build scoring (https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/launchpad/packageset-score/+merge/105915).  Awaiting completion of review.

 15:23:48 <cjwatson> Working on per-pocket upload permissions.

 15:23:51 <cjwatson> Switched to new self-service interface for backporters and decommissioned the code supporting the old archive-admin-only interface.

 15:23:54 <cjwatson> Caught up on miscellaneous archive admin work.

 15:23:56 <cjwatson> Retesting merges.ubuntu.com to see if it still dies after its firmware upgrade.

 15:23:59 <cjwatson> To do:

 15:24:02 <cjwatson> About to dive into aptdaemon bug 926340.

 15:24:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 926340 in aptdaemon (Ubuntu) "aptd crashed with UnicodeDecodeError in _set_error(): 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/926340

 15:24:04 <barry> cjwatson: \o/

 15:24:04 <cjwatson> Finish deploying new transition tracker.

 15:24:07 <cjwatson> ..

 15:24:34 <cjwatson> #topic Bugs

 15:24:47 <barry> cjwatson: have you seen glatzor's py3 port of aptdaemon?

 15:25:08 <cjwatson> bdmurray,stokachu: Anything we need to be caring about urgently, either for 12.04.1 or 12.10?  I haven't seen arsenal reports set up yet (which may well be my fault)

 15:25:08 <xnox> cjwatson: new transition tracker. Yeah!

 15:25:17 <cjwatson> barry: Yeah, on my to-do somewhere

 15:25:39 <barry> cjwatson: i have a stack of replies i owe him on it ;)

 15:25:53 <barry> xnox: py3 transition tracker ready yet? :)

 15:25:54 <cjwatson> xnox: got it mostly sorted with Laney at UDS, just need to polish

 15:25:59 <stokachu> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/520386 - has a MIR(?) Assigned to it with serge hallyn as the owner

 15:26:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 520386 in libvirt (Ubuntu Lucid) "libvirt-bin hypervisor does not support virConnectNumOfInterfaces / unable to create domain with virt-manager using network bridge" [Low,Confirmed]

 15:26:02 <bdmurray> cjwatson: I'm a bit confused by bug 998492

 15:26:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 998492 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Error while copying OS files" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/998492

 15:26:37 <xnox> barry: need to identify a few missing packages. then it can go onto new transition tracker ;-)

 15:26:51 <cjwatson> bdmurray: so am I :)

 15:26:52 <barry> xnox: awesome, thanks!

 15:26:53 <bdmurray> I'd thought the work in 922949 was supposed to help with some of this

 15:26:58 <cjwatson> as you say

 15:27:05 <stokachu> Here is the MIR for netcf https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netcf/+bug/904014

 15:27:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 904014 in netcf (Ubuntu) "[MIR] netcf" [Undecided,In progress]

 15:27:11 <cjwatson> which I *think* leaves the possibility that something ate it between that check and dpkg looking at it

 15:27:16 <xnox> bug 922949

 15:27:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922949 in apt (Ubuntu Precise) "installation process can crash due to an issue with one package when choosing "install updates" as part of the install" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922949

 15:27:37 <cjwatson> oh, no

 15:27:38 <cjwatson> May 12 16:49:13 ubuntu plugininstall.py: Failed to find package object for /target/var/cache/apt/archives/libreoffice-core_1%3a3.5.3-0ubuntu1_i386.deb: "The cache has no package named 'libreoffice-core:i386'"

 15:27:49 <cjwatson> So the check got confused and was ineffective ...

 15:27:57 <cjwatson> doh

 15:28:28 <cjwatson> bdmurray: I'll take this one for 12.04.1/12.10, it's clearly my fault anyway

 15:28:42 <bdmurray> okay, thanks

 15:28:55 * infinity knee-jerks every time he sees bzip2 fail to unzip something...

 15:28:58 <cjwatson> stokachu: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir/+members is the set of people empowered to move that forward

 15:29:16 <cjwatson> ah, maybe not, since they kicked it back to Serge for some work

 15:29:29 <stokachu> yea netcf seems to be giving him a lot of trouble

 15:29:44 <cjwatson> sounds like if you want to start sending patches that'd be welcome

 15:30:17 <stokachu> cjwatson: ok I was gonna start working on it when my load lightens a bit

 15:30:26 <stokachu> i was forced to do the windows port at the "other" company

 15:30:27 <stokachu> :X

 15:30:47 <cjwatson> I remember doing some libnl3 porting on some packages, though I don't remember whether netcf was one of them

 15:31:00 <cjwatson> if it was a hacky "build on Ubuntu damnit" patch it might have been me ;-)

 15:31:15 <stokachu> lol

 15:31:40 <stokachu> other than that I dont have any major bugs that haven't got attention yet

 15:32:02 <cjwatson> alrighty

 15:32:04 <cjwatson> #topic AOB

 15:32:10 <bdmurray> then I also had a question about bug 999890 - we inadvertenly let a bunch of bugs be reported that we did not want.

 15:32:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 999890 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "does not block follow up errors from earlier reports" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/999890

 15:32:15 <cjwatson> ah, too quick

 15:32:31 <bdmurray> either section is fine ;-)

 15:32:48 <bdmurray> so the question is what to do about the existing reports that got through

 15:33:00 <bdmurray> just auto-close them or let them be?

 15:33:24 <cjwatson> will they always have been accompanied by some other real report?

 15:33:37 <Laney> ben> we might want to merge with upstream: notably it has support for matching on Suggests/Recomemnds/Enhances/Replaces now, which might be useful. It does IIRC have a new dependency though.

 15:33:48 <bdmurray> yes, there will be one initial failure and then multiple follow on reports

 15:34:16 <cjwatson> if so we could close them with an apology for the runaround, a note that the initial failure is the real bug, and saying they can reopen if we got it wrong

 15:34:33 <bdmurray> I could search for the initial failure and mark the follow ons as dupes but they seems rather complicated.

 15:34:37 <cjwatson> Laney: let me know in advance of the new dep if possible, since I'll need to run that through RT

 15:34:48 <Laney> yeah

 15:35:14 <bdmurray> cjwatson: okay sounds good

 15:35:44 <cjwatson> maybe link to their +reportedbugs or something

 15:36:08 <cjwatson> in fact you could point them at https://bugs.launchpad.net/~/+reportedbugs

 15:36:25 <cjwatson> save looking up their id

 15:36:48 <cjwatson> anything else?

 15:37:43 <cjwatson> Bueller?

 15:37:54 <ev> as mentioned I'll set up tarmac

 15:37:59 <ev> team-wide

 15:38:12 * cjwatson looks forward to fighting with it ;)

 15:38:18 <cjwatson> cool

 15:38:22 <ev> :)

 15:38:29 <cjwatson> ok, thanks all

 15:38:30 <cjwatson> #endmeeting
