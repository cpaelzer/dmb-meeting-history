 20:10:47 <czajkowski> commandoline: welcome

 20:10:51 <czajkowski> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/marten-de-vries

 20:10:57 <commandoline> thanks

 20:11:00 <czajkowski> commandoline: care to tell us a little about yourself

 20:11:22 <commandoline> Hello, I am Marten de Vries, and live in the Netherlands. My main Ubuntu contributions are in the Ubuntu Nederland loco team, mostly in its webteam and Mwanzo team. (The last of them helps users that want to start contributing to Ubuntu.)

 20:11:23 * stgraber waves

 20:11:31 <czajkowski> drubin: iulian ogra_ stgraber thanks

 20:12:40 <czajkowski> commandoline: can you tell us some more about the Mwanzo team ?

 20:13:03 <drubin> o/

 20:13:16 <commandoline> Of course, it teaches Ubuntu users more about how to contribute to Ubuntu

 20:13:28 <commandoline> e.g. via workshops (like the international Ubuntu classroom project)

 20:13:52 <commandoline> but it's also the place where people are pointed to in the Dutch loco if they want to contribute but don't know how

 20:14:20 <commandoline> so to our IRC channel

 20:14:46 <czajkowski> commandoline: ca I ask why a seperate team from say the beginners team that already exists?

 20:14:51 <czajkowski> *can

 20:14:59 <commandoline> czajkowski: the difference is we support users in Dutch

 20:15:17 <commandoline> * help, my English isn't perfect either :P

 20:15:26 <czajkowski> that's fine

 20:15:32 <drubin> commandoline: How does working on open  teacher differ from your work with ubuntu?

 20:16:25 <commandoline> drubin: well, it's officially a separate project and this is about Ubuntu Membership. But of course it's in the repo's now thanks to porthose

 20:16:53 <commandoline> and it's also opensource software, of which all main devs are Ubuntu NL community members at the moment.

 20:18:00 <czajkowski> you mention the classroom project, do you see yourself getting more involved in the greater ubuntu wide community ?

 20:18:01 <commandoline> czajkowski: for you question: it's not just helping in Dutch by the way, but also that all the wiki pages etc. are in dutch

 20:18:07 <drubin> commandoline: that is why I asked how it differed. It is interesting to see how external projects make it into peoples work.

 20:18:15 <iulian> commandoline: Let's say that I'm a new Dutch user who wants to contribute to Ubuntu but my English is not that good. How can I get in touch with Mwanzo? Do you guys have a place where you advertise it? How would I become aware of its existence?

 20:18:22 <drubin> commandoline: Nice on it being a commnunity project.

 20:18:29 * drubin is ready to vote btw

 20:18:51 * ogra_ too,

 20:18:53 <commandoline> so you just don't need to know a word of English, which some people in the netherlands don't.

 20:18:56 <czajkowski> ogra_: stgraber iulian any more comments/questions?

 20:18:59 <commandoline> drubin: ok

 20:19:08 * stgraber is ready to vote

 20:19:16 <Thomas_de_Graaff> \o/

 20:19:18 <commandoline> iulian: well, you probably would go to the Ubuntu NL Forum

 20:19:34 <commandoline> it's the place where most of the dutch community members are

 20:19:43 <commandoline> often to get support when installing e.g.

 20:19:50 <commandoline> there are links there to the mwanzo team

 20:20:00 <commandoline> and even a subforum where we advertise what we do

 20:20:19 <commandoline> so you'd see it via the dutch loco site

 20:20:19 <iulian> commandoline: OK, brill. Thanks.

 20:20:22 <iulian> czajkowski: Ready.

 20:20:23 <commandoline> and also via IRC, maybe

 20:20:26 <Ronnie> \o/
