 16:02:24 <rbasak> Final freeze is today

 16:02:36 <rbasak> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:02:40 <rbasak> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:03:04 <rbasak> There's one critical bug - bug 1064420 which just came in and Daviey assigned to adam_g

 16:03:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1064420 in horizon (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu theme in Horizon dashboard causes formatting issues" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1064420

 16:03:31 <rbasak> Should I go through the others?

 16:03:48 <ScottK> Final freeze is just for Main/seeded Universe packages.  Unseeded packages can still be uploaded after today.

 16:04:30 <adam_g> rbasak: i just got notification that the new theme is done and ready for packaging. will upload this morning if zul hasn't gottne to it already

 16:04:42 <rbasak> Great, thanks!

 16:04:46 <arosales> rbasak: yes lets tough on the others

 16:05:03 <rbasak> bug 978963

 16:05:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 978963 in keystone (Ubuntu Precise) "add release note that OpenStack should be used on a protected network" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/978963

 16:05:43 <rbasak> This was targeted to 12.04

 16:05:52 <rbasak> Should we still be tracking it?

 16:06:05 <jamespage> I think it still needs documenting in the release notes

 16:06:11 * jamespage takes the bug to save pain

 16:06:18 <rbasak> thanks jamespage!

 16:06:27 <rbasak> bug 1049305

 16:06:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1049305 in glance (Ubuntu) "package glance-registry 2012.1.3+stable~20120821-120fcf-0ubuntu1 failed to install/upgrade: sub-processo script post-installation instalado retornou estado de saída de erro 1" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1049305

 16:07:04 <rbasak> This looks like it's still not reproducable

 16:07:18 <adam_g> ya im not sure about that one

 16:07:30 <rbasak> Should we still be tracking this?

 16:08:10 <rbasak> cjwatson: bug 1050595 is still in progress I presume?

 16:08:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1050595 in lowmem (Ubuntu Quantal) "Ubuntu Server installation with 128M ram hangs" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1050595

 16:08:22 <adam_g> rbasak: i would say no, unless its confirmed

 16:08:59 <jamespage> adam_g, +1

 16:09:27 <rbasak> I don't have permission to remove ~ubuntu-server-release-tracking from bug 1049305

 16:09:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1049305 in glance (Ubuntu) "package glance-registry 2012.1.3+stable~20120821-120fcf-0ubuntu1 failed to install/upgrade: sub-processo script post-installation instalado retornou estado de saída de erro 1" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1049305

 16:09:38 <rbasak> arosales: can you do it please?

 16:09:56 <cjwatson> rbasak: I'll update it today or tomorrow - I've been investigating on and off, modulo secure boot pain

 16:10:03 <rbasak> thanks cjwatson!

 16:10:13 <cjwatson> rbasak: I think the result is going to be bouncing it to you guys for doc updates after all - what way should I do that?

 16:10:14 <arosales> rbasak: sure, I'll update 1049305

 16:10:36 <cjwatson> I'll check one more time but I couldn't make it work at 128M with the framebuffer on

 16:10:43 <cjwatson> so while maybe lowmem should be updated, it's kind of moot

 16:10:43 <jamespage> cjwatson, assign to me and I'll deal with it alongside the install size stuff

 16:11:10 <cjwatson> ok

 16:11:14 <rbasak> jamespage: thanks, and that answers bug 1053770 as well I guess?

 16:11:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1053770 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu Quantal) "ubuntu-server install takes up too much space" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1053770

 16:11:19 <jamespage> yep

 16:11:37 <rbasak> bug 1046340

 16:11:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1046340 in ntp (Ubuntu) "ntp package missing logcheck exceptions file /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/ntp" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1046340

 16:11:54 <rbasak> This is currently unassigned

 16:12:56 <rbasak> Any volunteers, or shall I leave it for next week?

 16:13:14 <jamespage> please do

 16:13:20 <rbasak> And finally bug 1059907

 16:13:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1059907 in nova (Ubuntu) "python-nova depends on python-setuptools-git?" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1059907

 16:13:30 <rbasak> I'm not sure zul's here so we can leave that as well as it's Low.

 16:13:57 <zul> its not going to get fixed today unfortunately

 16:14:33 <rbasak> What do we do for the other stuff on the release bug page?

 16:14:37 <rbasak> I see one ARM ftbfs

 16:14:40 <rbasak> Some MIRs

 16:15:56 <jamespage> ftbfs looks like a non-issue - things are up-to-date

 16:16:14 <jamespage> mirs all juju apart from the last one

 16:16:22 <jamespage> so no longer current

 16:16:30 <arosales> jamespage: should we touch on http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:16:36 <jamespage> yeah

 16:16:43 <jamespage> rbasak, want me to do that?

 16:16:49 <rbasak> jamespage: please!

 16:17:12 <rbasak> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:17:15 <jamespage> this is the interesting link: http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:17:44 <jamespage> SpamapS - hoping we get a 0.6 release of Juju today which closes a few of those....

 16:18:06 <rbasak> Should we have this link in the regular agenda?

 16:18:14 <jamespage> yes

 16:18:44 * rbasak adds it

 16:19:32 <hallyn> for bug 1017847, i'm still debating (and will probably discuss at uds) what to do about foreign arches at lxc-create

 16:19:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017847 in lxc (Ubuntu) "qemu segfaults when creating an armhf container on an amd64 host" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017847

 16:19:49 <hallyn> so id shouldn't ahve the rls-q-tracking tg probably

 16:20:06 <jamespage> hallyn - ok - just drop the quantal task from the bug then

 16:20:23 <hallyn> tag?

 16:20:24 <jamespage> zul: bug 861656 still relevant?

 16:20:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 861656 in nova (Ubuntu Quantal) "Kernel oops when nbd device is removed before it is unmounted" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/861656

 16:20:35 <hallyn> jamespage: i see a quantal tag, but not a task for quantal

 16:20:41 <zul> jamespage: yeah

 16:21:06 <jamespage> hallyn, sorry - its release-q-notfixing (just did it)

 16:21:21 <hallyn> kthx

 16:21:40 <hallyn> bug 1057024 also should have that tag dropped - we'll look into it during uds

 16:21:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1057024 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) "kvm kernel module always loaded, without setting /dev/kvm permissions" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1057024

 16:21:56 <jamespage> smoser: any comments on the maas related bugs?

 16:22:10 <jamespage> bug 994781

 16:22:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 994781 in maas (Ubuntu Quantal) "removing a node when it has failed commissioning is not possible from the UI" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/994781

 16:22:42 <jamespage> smoser: great - thanks

 16:22:48 <jamespage> I'll not list them all....

 16:22:52 <smoser> if they're not fixed in trunk at this point (som of them are) then they're not getting fixed before SRU

 16:23:22 <jamespage> smoser: please re-target tasks as appropriate (or Won't fix if need be)

 16:23:36 <jamespage> ivoks is not around for the dovecot one

 16:23:43 <jamespage> rbasak, time to move on from bugs I think

 16:23:53 <rbasak> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:24:02 <rbasak> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-overview.html

 16:24:37 <jamespage> please don't ask me about servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:24:49 <jamespage> rbasak, want me to run through those as well

 16:24:54 <rbasak> Please

 16:24:57 * jamespage that way I can avoid hard questions...

 16:25:15 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-charms

 16:25:43 <jamespage> adam_g, all on track for release?

 16:26:32 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-qa

 16:26:47 <jamespage> adam_g, zul - we need to start postponing those and adding them into R blueprints

 16:27:00 <zul> agreed ill do it

 16:27:07 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-open-attestation

 16:27:20 <jamespage> almost done - targetting partner so can be a little late

 16:27:44 <jamespage> m_3, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:28:05 <jamespage> or maybe jimbaker

 16:29:12 <jamespage> finally https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:29:24 <jamespage> SpamapS/m_3 again

 16:29:49 <jimbaker> jamespage, i'm finalizing a test wrapper (jitsu test) to make the unit testing more reliable

 16:29:53 <jamespage> I guess my final comment is that we really need to be postponing any outstanding work items that won't get done in the next 7 days

 16:30:03 <jamespage> sorry 10 days

 16:30:26 <jimbaker> with the idea that it can be run by either jenkins or a developer directly

 16:30:35 <jamespage> carry stuff over to UDS-R if need be - but leave yourself enough time to prepare (rather than rushing to finish non-critical work items)

 16:30:51 <arosales> final 10 day push :-)

 16:30:54 <jamespage> rbasak, thats me done

 16:30:59 <rbasak> thanks jamespage!

 16:31:01 <jamespage> jimbaker, thanks for the update

 16:31:03 <jamespage> np

 16:31:05 <rbasak> #subtopic Review obsolete configs found by QA

 16:31:06 <rbasak> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-September/001926.html

 16:31:09 <rbasak> arosales added this to the agenda on 14 September, but I don't see that it was discussed last week. Does this still need to be there?

 16:32:19 <rbasak> I skip it for now then I guess

 16:32:21 <rbasak> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:32:23 <TheLordOfTime> rbasak, if i'm reading that right, some of those bugs were fixed

 16:32:27 <TheLordOfTime> according to LP at elast

 16:33:09 <jamespage> something called UDS is happening in a few weeks

 16:33:16 <rbasak> The agenda also has: CFP deadlines -     SoCal Linux Expo (Deadline: Dec. 10) http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/cfp

 16:33:20 <arosales> rbasak: that list may be a bit old, but we should sync up with QA on what configs are still old

 16:33:21 <jamespage> Copenhagen

 16:33:55 <rbasak> arosales: I presume that's tracked in the individual bugs?

 16:33:58 <jamespage> see https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2012-October/006403.html for details on how to raise sessions for discussion

 16:34:22 <arosales> hggdh: we should sync up on cofigs, re https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-September/001926.html

 16:34:28 <arosales> rbasak: yes, I think they are

 16:34:41 <rbasak> Any other events?

 16:34:55 <arosales> rbasak: it looks like  gema has them listed under relevant bugs

 16:35:19 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:35:32 <rbasak> hggdh: over to you

 16:36:19 <rbasak> I guess he's not here.

 16:36:20 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:36:25 <smb> Not much to report beyond the hope of having resolved bug 1021471 for most people, except it seems for people using wl. Somewhat hoping for a bit of time without new problems to get back to the known things I failed to have time for.

 16:36:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021471 in Linux "clone() hang when creating new network namespace (dmesg show unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021471

 16:36:31 <smb> ..

 16:36:54 <rbasak> Any questions for smb?

 16:37:22 <SpamapS> smb: for the netns bug..

 16:37:35 <SpamapS> smb: You have a fix comitted for the route cache clearing..

 16:37:41 <SpamapS> smb: and we'll open a new bug for WL, right?

 16:37:49 <smb> SpamapS, Right

 16:38:12 <hallyn> smb: have you tested the 3.5.6-stable tree by chance?

 16:38:48 <hallyn> might get us some extra review of the patch and remaining bug on SpamapS' laptop

 16:38:53 <smb> hallyn, no that arrived later but I did not see anything addressing the first half

 16:39:09 <smb> hallyn, for the second that seemed to be still in 3.6, right?

 16:39:16 <smb> SpamapS, ^

 16:39:40 <SpamapS> smb: right, its in 3.6

 16:39:46 <SpamapS> I suspect WL is not doing something its supposed to do

 16:40:05 <hallyn> i think so.  my point was we can get lkml to care about the bug still in upstream, but then we can get the 3.5.6-stable tree (gregkh owns it) to care about the other bug

 16:40:23 <smb> hallyn, upstream is likely not to care that much about wl

 16:40:26 <hallyn> anyways - awesome job finding the fix!  (or workaround)

 16:40:39 <SpamapS> I suspect WL is not doing something its supposed to do

 16:40:40 <SpamapS> doh sorry

 16:40:41 <hallyn> smb: true.

 16:40:59 <SpamapS> smb: wouldn't upstream for WL be broadcom?

 16:41:26 <smb> SpamapS, Yeah, somehow. Not sure there is much influence on them

 16:42:21 <smb> for part 1 i hope at some point and after some prodding we could get it to stable upstream

 16:43:29 <SpamapS> smb: seems critical enough

 16:43:58 <rbasak> OK, anything else for smb?

 16:44:21 <rbasak> Thanks smb!

 16:44:24 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:44:29 <rbasak> MAAS on ARM is looking good! Everything bar squashfs should ship with 12.10, with out-of-the-box support for highbank.

 16:44:38 <rbasak> Note that a maas-enlist SRU (bug 1056816) is still pending. I posted a workaround to maas-devel.

 16:44:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1056816 in maas-enlist (Ubuntu Precise) "maas-enlist does not post subarch" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1056816

 16:44:47 <rbasak> Also, you have to use "juju bootstrap --contraints arch=arm" even if your MAAS cluster is entirely arm. I don't like this so I filed bug 1064291 on this today.

 16:44:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1064291 in juju "Default architecture constraint of amd64 makes no sense on arm" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1064291

 16:44:59 <rbasak> Any questions for me?

 16:45:45 <arosales> rbasak: thanks for continuing to hammer on ARM support in MAAS :-)

 16:45:59 <rbasak> No problem!

 16:46:20 <rbasak> #topic Open Discussion

 16:46:54 <SpamapS> just to revisit on Juju..

 16:47:04 <SpamapS> I'll be releasing Juju 0.6 shortly..

 16:47:19 <SpamapS> followed by an FFE and (hopefully) upload to quantal.

 16:47:49 <jimbaker> SpamapS, awesome

 16:48:09 <rbasak> That sounds great. Thanks SpamapS!

 16:48:28 <rbasak> Any other business?

 16:48:35 <Daviey> SpamapS: i looked at the FFe you raised last week and ack'd that.. Needs a refresh for the latest commits

 16:48:49 <SpamapS> Daviey: right, should I open the new one?

 16:49:08 <SpamapS> Daviey: *technically* all the commits just fix bugs in the local provider... but.. with a major refactoring ;)

 16:49:09 <Daviey> SpamapS: nah, just bump the latest one

 16:49:29 <Daviey> SpamapS: I'm pretty sure it's a documentation exercise right now, but would be good to confirm.

 16:49:36 <SpamapS> Daviey: agreed

 16:49:51 <SpamapS> Daviey: the new local provider is less broken than the old one, but still a major change late in the release.

 16:50:26 <jamespage> SpamapS, feel free to use bug 1063697

 16:50:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1063697 in juju (Ubuntu Quantal) "[FFe] Please update to new snapshot release ~bzr592" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1063697

 16:50:35 <jamespage> I think I did most of the doc work already

 16:50:49 <SpamapS> jamespage: sweet

 16:52:15 <rbasak> I guess that's it then.

 16:52:16 <rbasak> #topic Announce next meeting date and time
