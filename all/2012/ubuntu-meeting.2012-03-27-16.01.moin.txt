 16:01:41 <SpamapS> No actions from last week, so lets get right into precise dev

 16:01:46 <SpamapS> #topic Precise Development

 16:02:04 <zul> |o|

 16:02:08 <smoser> o/

 16:02:17 <hallyn> (btw, kvm disk io perf regrssion might ought to be added to agenda, not sure)

 16:03:03 <SpamapS> BTW, it would be helpful to have the release bug tracker in the meeting agenda

 16:03:06 * SpamapS does not know the link

 16:03:10 <arosales> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:03:47 <arosales> SpamapS: probably should add that link and the server team blueprint link

 16:03:53 <Ursinha> I recall adding the link to the meeting page

 16:04:02 <SpamapS> Ok well I added the report link to the meeting

 16:04:17 <arosales> ubuntu server team blueprint link (for reference) http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:04:35 <arosales> although that will obviously change with different cycles.

 16:04:51 <SpamapS> Ok, lots of bugs still to get through

 16:09:37 <adam_g> ive sadly made no progress on that since last time, theres so much going on. if anyone else wants to help with that transition bug, please step up! :)

 16:10:11 <SpamapS> I suspect that will affect lucid to precise as well

 16:10:54 <adam_g> yes, theres not much we can do to work around it but we can do our best to make it as obvious to users thats the transition has happened

 16:10:57 <SpamapS> anybody else have some available bandwidth to take over bug #924739?

 16:10:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924739 in squid3 (Ubuntu Precise) "after upgrade from oneiric to precise, previous squid config unused, cannot be used when relocated" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924739

 16:11:35 <jamespage> SpamapS, adam_g: I can spare a few cycles - lemme catchup with adam_g later

 16:11:40 <SpamapS> smoser: is that just there for good measure?

 16:11:58 <smoser> probably.

 16:12:07 <smoser> i'd love it if someone wanted to take it

 16:12:08 <smoser> :)

 16:12:21 <smoser> but i dont have it on my list of things that i'm going to fix right now.

 16:12:52 <SpamapS> bug #930916

 16:12:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930916 in amavisd-new (Ubuntu) "amavis start-stop script fails to stop amavisd" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930916

 16:13:06 <SpamapS> I haven't poked it since last time, but intend to.. soon.. I swear. ;)

 16:13:13 <utlemming> smoser: I can't commit entirely to fixing it...but I can try. I have a lot on my plate, but I'm blocked today, so I'll take a stab

 16:13:23 <SpamapS> bug #959262

 16:13:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 959262 in python-novaclient (Ubuntu) "[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/www/.novaclient'" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/959262

 16:13:46 <adam_g> SpamapS: that one is fixed upstream, but we need to get it on their radar so its backported to essex/milestone-proposed. shouold happen today

 16:13:58 <adam_g> otherwise we can patch, but shouldnt need to. its trivial

 16:14:15 <SpamapS> adam_g: is it definitely going to happen before release, or 0-day SRU?

 16:14:58 <SpamapS> bug #880339

 16:14:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 880339 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Precise) "AppArmor profile needs update" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/880339

 16:15:13 <adam_g> SpamapS: should happen well before

 16:15:19 <SpamapS> That one is actually Fix Committed .. just need to get 5.5.22 in as well

 16:15:19 <Daviey> we really don't need to be thinking about 0-day SRU's yet.

 16:15:23 <SpamapS> adam_g: alright

 16:15:34 <SpamapS> Daviey: lot of bugs here.. not much time. ;)

 16:16:06 <SpamapS> bug #907197

 16:17:07 <SpamapS> Bueller? Bueller?

 16:17:22 <SpamapS> zul: ^^ ?

 16:17:36 <zul> no response from user

 16:17:37 <Daviey> SpamapS: if we have time to plan to do a 0-day SRU at this stage, we have time to get it in the release. :)

 16:17:47 <SpamapS> bug #966069

 16:17:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 966069 in horizon (Ubuntu) "/etc/apache2/conf.d/dashboard.conf contains wrong paths in the Ubuntu package" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/966069

 16:18:01 <SpamapS> Daviey: I admire your optimism! :)

 16:18:07 <Daviey> zul is already cracking that one out i think

 16:18:08 <zul> SpamapS: fixed in bzr

 16:18:12 <Daviey> \o/

 16:18:49 <SpamapS> bug #901881

 16:18:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova and glance should depend on python-keystone" [Low,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:19:24 <SpamapS> zul: can you make sure the status is right on that bug?

 16:19:47 <SpamapS> bug #959426

 16:19:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 959426 in Glance "nova + glance services die if started before db is reachable" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/959426

 16:20:30 <adam_g> SpamapS: in progress just like the nova task

 16:20:34 <adam_g> same fix, basically

 16:21:17 <SpamapS> sweet

 16:21:24 <SpamapS> on to blueprints

 16:21:30 <SpamapS> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:22:00 <arosales> so we are at week 24/28 Bet2 release on the 29th

 16:22:18 <arosales> ~85% thorough the cycle if you count all the way up to release

 16:23:07 <arosales> Overall progress is 77%, so we have a few blueprints we need to evaluate if we are going to be able to complete this cycle

 16:23:26 <arosales> SpamapS: Would you like to iterate through the blueprints?

 16:23:42 <SpamapS> arosales: I was just looking through them for those that seem behind

 16:23:57 <SpamapS> servercloud-p-juju-charm-testing

 16:24:11 <SpamapS> m_3 and I are working on getting that one back on track this week.

 16:24:24 <SpamapS> servercloud-p-openstack-testing

 16:25:14 <SpamapS> adam_g: only one TODO left, Collaborate on defining charm use workflow between OpenStack and Ubuntu: TODO ... seems like that doesn't make much sense to do before 12.04 releases

 16:25:38 <SpamapS> servercloud-p-automated-boot-testing

 16:26:04 <SpamapS> That one is mine, and I need to update the status. jamespage has saved me on this one, and we actually have a single reboot test now for LAMP :)

 16:26:15 <adam_g> SpamapS: its something we'll likely be discussing at ODS in a couple of weeks, so left as a TODO till then. but right, its not release critical by any means

 16:26:37 <SpamapS> adam_g: alright sounds good

 16:26:41 <SpamapS> servercloud-p-cloud-power-management

 16:27:49 <SpamapS> I'm going to invite aquette to come to next week's meeting so we can discuss this

 16:27:59 <Daviey> SpamapS: that sounds great

 16:28:08 <SpamapS> #action SpamapS invite aquette to next server team meeting to discuss servercloud-p-cloud-power-management

 16:28:08 * meetingology SpamapS invite aquette to next server team meeting to discuss servercloud-p-cloud-power-management

 16:28:57 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-arm-service-orchestration

 16:28:57 <Daviey> SpamapS: EOF?

 16:29:03 <SpamapS> couple more

 16:29:33 <SpamapS> rbasak: that one looks mostly on track, just pinging you on it since its < 75%

 16:29:42 <Daviey> rbasak: We can go through, [racb] Validate cobbler enlistment works: TODO .. later if you want?

 16:30:00 <SpamapS> also [racb] Validate juju using orchestra: TODO should probably be maas. :)

 16:30:11 <rbasak> I feel a bit blocked on the new orchestra stuff and ARM support

 16:30:21 <Daviey> rbasak: Grab me after this?

 16:30:22 <rbasak> It's not quite clear what needs to be done with regard to this.

 16:30:27 <rbasak> Daviey: OK

 16:30:27 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-ceph

 16:31:01 <SpamapS> MIR still pending.. I think I'll postpone a few of the items in that one this week.

 16:31:26 <hallyn> we may want to take more active role in that one next cycle

 16:31:33 <Daviey> the MIR team are *too* loaded right now.

 16:31:43 <SpamapS> Yes, I think the MIR team needs another member.

 16:31:48 <Daviey> Adding anything other than pure essential stuff is a no-go

 16:32:02 <SpamapS> Its likely we'll continue to add openstack components and other bits.

 16:32:04 <Daviey> Ie, if it's not the on the cd, it's a hard push to consider a MIR now.

 16:32:29 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-orchestra

 16:32:37 <SpamapS> That one is mostly on track, but looks a little behind

 16:33:23 <Daviey> now accurate

 16:33:28 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack

 16:33:39 <SpamapS> Perhaps just lagging on WI updates?

 16:33:59 <Daviey> zul: ^^

 16:34:13 <zul> Daviey: yeah need to update it today

 16:34:18 <zul> mostly on track though

 16:34:29 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-kvm-document-suggested-changes

 16:34:50 <hallyn> Just updated that.  What remains TODO, I intend TODO

 16:34:58 <SpamapS> sweet

 16:34:59 <Daviey> groovy

 16:35:16 <SpamapS> just a couple more

 16:35:31 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-juju-mir

 16:35:47 <SpamapS> Been working with jdstrand on this directly all week.

 16:36:04 <Daviey> seemed intensive

 16:36:05 <SpamapS> We have some security concerns to address, but otherwise it is progressing.

 16:36:38 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack-charms

 16:37:08 <Daviey> adam_g: ^

 16:37:11 <SpamapS> Some of these I think can be pushed as updates to the charms post-release

 16:37:14 <adam_g> SpamapS: those are all not release critical, and not sure which will get done before release

 16:37:36 <SpamapS> adam_g: perhaps just POSTPONE them and if you end up doing them, go back and change them to DONE?

 16:37:37 <adam_g> i think pots-UDS calm would be a better time to address those, short of the swift tasks.. those charms need updating for keystone auth

 16:38:15 <adam_g> SpamapS: yeah, sounds good

 16:38:56 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-juju-roadmap

 16:38:58 <SpamapS> Last one

 16:39:07 <SpamapS> juju team is landing many of those this week

 16:39:54 <Daviey> - Okay.. So.. Beta-2... -

 16:40:02 <SpamapS> aye

 16:40:05 <Daviey> I'll be doing another spin later on today.

 16:40:16 <zul> how come?

 16:40:17 <Daviey> Is there anything else which is a candidate for inclusion ?

 16:40:28 <Daviey> zul: Some changes required on the cd.

 16:40:33 <Daviey> :)

 16:40:39 <adam_g> Daviey: there are some other openstack rc1's that trickled in after freeze

 16:40:53 <adam_g> nova, especially

 16:40:58 <Daviey> adam_g: I saw a less than important quantum upload

 16:41:00 <Daviey> anything else?

 16:41:09 <adam_g> Daviey: i think nova was the only in-main component

 16:41:11 <adam_g> zul ?

 16:41:11 <Daviey> Has that been uploaded?  Is it in the queue?

 16:41:19 <adam_g> oh!

 16:41:23 <adam_g> keystone, though not in main

 16:41:24 <zul> it beens uploaded for a while now

 16:41:36 <Daviey> ok

 16:41:44 <Daviey> I also pruned some things from the cd..

 16:41:54 <Daviey> (including puppet and zsh)

 16:42:08 <Daviey> Anything else beta-2 critical ?

 16:42:09 <SpamapS> not zsh!! ;)

 16:42:19 <SpamapS> Daviey: I can get you a few MB in mysql-client

 16:42:23 <Daviey> SpamapS: fear not, it's still in mai.

 16:42:33 <Daviey> SpamapS: have bags of space right now :)

 16:42:38 <Daviey> now ruby is off the cd :)

 16:42:39 <SpamapS> ok good

 16:42:59 <SpamapS> (about ruby being gone, not your space.. who cares about space? ;)

 16:43:08 <Daviey> Okay, nothing else of importance.. lets skip beta-2 and go straight to release. :)

 16:43:27 <SpamapS> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vde2/+bug/776818

 16:43:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 776818 in vde2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] vde2" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:43:29 <zul> space...the final frontier...these are the voyages of the..

 16:43:59 <hallyn> basically i was wondering if anyone else wanted to asnwer jdstrand's question:  "does serverr team want this"

 16:44:14 <hallyn> i think the answer is, users want it so yes,

 16:44:15 <SpamapS> heh, at this point, "Not for P"

 16:44:28 <hallyn> naturally :)

 16:44:59 <hallyn> but if the answer is yes, better to answer that now so when they have time, mir team can consider

 16:45:17 <hallyn> otoh,

 16:45:25 <hallyn> vde2 is way behind debian's version, and noone has cared enough to mention it

 16:45:54 <SpamapS> I know it sucks to keep pushing back but this is LATE

 16:45:55 <Daviey> hallyn: I'd like a UDS session on making kvm rock harder.. this can be discussed there

 16:45:59 <SpamapS> lets push this to Q and make sure it happens in Q

 16:46:18 <hallyn> SpamapS: of course it's pushed to Q, but i don't think answering the q should be pushed to q

 16:46:33 <hallyn> all right ifne

 16:46:38 <SpamapS> Sounds good

 16:46:40 <Daviey> hallyn: we can push it to discuss at UDS-Q. :)

 16:46:45 <SpamapS> time to move on

 16:46:51 <SpamapS> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:46:52 <hallyn> Daviey: (we did that last time :)

 16:46:59 <Daviey> hallyn: *doh*

 16:49:39 <SpamapS> hggdh: anything to report?

 16:49:53 <SpamapS> I suspect once Daviey does his respin we should all try to crank out some ISO testing

 16:50:09 <hggdh> nothing, except I had just finished the server tests when I heard of the respin...

 16:50:12 <hggdh> ..

 16:50:31 <hallyn> someone buy the man a cupcake :(

 16:50:37 <SpamapS> hggdh: I just threw something across the room in your honor

 16:50:38 <hggdh> SpamapS: actually, yes, help will be very appreciated ;-)

 16:50:54 <hggdh> SpamapS: thank you. I hope it did not break anything

 16:51:00 <Daviey> 4 more test cases will be added to the tracker later doay

 16:51:02 <Daviey> today

 16:51:05 <SpamapS> Seriously, people, give the iso a try..  http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com

 16:51:13 <hggdh> Daviey: perfect

 16:51:23 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:51:27 <smb> Hi

 16:51:31 <smb> Meddled a bit more in libvirt and could find the reason why xen shutdown is not seen in some cases. Sent patches upstream (to be so far ignored) and asked hallyn for sponsorship into precise.

 16:51:39 <Daviey> Hey smb.. How is our lovely kernel?

 16:51:45 <smb> Apart from that not that much exiting. :)

 16:52:07 <smb> ..

 16:52:10 <Daviey> smb: i386 on heavy boxes?  Is that being worked on?

 16:52:31 <smb> Yes, apw wanted to think about a few things

 16:52:45 <tgardner> Daviey, you read Andy's analysis, right ?

 16:52:47 <smb> He had a few ideas how to go forward there

 16:52:48 <Daviey> smb: In time for kernel final freeze?

 16:52:58 <Daviey> tgardner: Yes, it was very compressive

 16:53:02 <Daviey> comprehensive

 16:53:13 * smb believes the probablility is good

 16:53:16 <tgardner> Daviey, I don't think there is anything we'll do before freeze

 16:53:17 <SpamapS> much love to the kernel team.. I have no complaints... both my macs, and my hundreds of short lived EC2 instances have all worked perfectly. :)

 16:53:32 <Daviey> tgardner: I tohught the outcome was a printk "System incompatible with current kernel" etc.

 16:53:55 <tgardner> Daviey, I think we can do that

 16:54:18 <hallyn> except I think there's possibility our kvm guest perf woes might need kernel love... need to dig further

 16:54:18 <Daviey> tgardner: I am adding to our MIN system requirements a MAX system requirement for i386, for the release notes.

 16:54:36 <Daviey> hallyn: You've been speaking to smoser about kvm perf?

 16:54:37 <smb> hallyn, Keep me posted there

 16:54:39 <hallyn> yes

 16:54:45 <hallyn> both

 16:54:46 <Daviey> groovy

 16:54:50 <tgardner> Daviey, Andy knows the most about this, but he's not in right now.

 16:54:54 <smoser> yeah, thats gonna be fun.

 16:54:59 <Daviey> ok, thanks tgardner / smb

 16:55:15 <SpamapS> Alright moving on

 16:55:19 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:55:25 <smoser> i just want to make sure that we do a reasonable job, and ideally pick off the low hanging fruit for this cycle, not next.

 16:55:30 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:55:42 <hallyn> rbasak: mind running an lxc testsuite on arm in next week or two?

 16:55:51 <SpamapS> rbasak: I can has armserver?! kthxbai

 16:55:52 <rbasak> hallyn: sure.

 16:55:55 <hallyn> (i need to convert it to pyunit, but for now...)

 16:55:55 <hallyn> thx

 16:56:11 <hallyn> hopefully no weird apparmor related glitches there

 16:56:27 <SpamapS> rbasak: thanks!
