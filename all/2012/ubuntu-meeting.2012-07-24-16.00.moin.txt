 16:00:39 <zul> so welcome to the server team meeting

 16:00:52 <zul> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:00:55 <jamespage> o/

 16:01:00 <zul> there are two from last meeting

 16:01:12 <zul> arosales and daviey to work on trend line reset * everyone update their blueprint status

 16:01:25 <arosales> zul: in progress

 16:01:32 <zul> so first point: arosales and daviey to work on trend line reset

 16:01:34 <zul> okies

 16:01:44 <zul> and everybody should be updating their blueprints

 16:01:44 <arosales> I haven't got the trend line reset, but working on getting the right level for topics

 16:01:46 <zul> so next

 16:01:48 <smoser> o/

 16:01:58 <zul> #topic Quantal Development

 16:02:12 <zul> arosales/Daviey: ^^^

 16:02:31 <arosales> I have a few blueprint items to go over

 16:02:55 <arosales> We are on week 13/25 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule) approaching the halfway mark and A3 this Thursday.

 16:03:12 <arosales> half way, shocked me too

 16:03:20 <zul> it goes by quick

 16:03:34 <arosales> so we still have a few blueprints that are at 0% or near that

 16:03:52 <arosales> given some work happens rapidly at the end I wanted to still touch base on a couple of those

 16:04:10 <arosales> for the ARM ones @ 0% as rbasak is out I pined cmagina

 16:04:16 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-benchmark-and-performance

 16:04:16 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-server-storage-testing

 16:04:39 <arosales> Juju related

 16:04:49 <arosales> SpamapS, m_3: any work items in progress here besides jitsu watch?

 16:04:58 <arosales> for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:05:28 <arosales> I don't think SpamapS is here atm, so may have to lean on m_3

 16:05:30 <m_3> arosales: not yet no... maybe making charmtester work for other providers counts here

 16:05:41 <arosales> and have some logs for Spamaps to catch up on

 16:05:43 <m_3> but not specifically tested against arm yet

 16:06:06 <arosales> m_3:  ok thanks

 16:06:13 <arosales> m_3: SpamapS:  work items for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy are mostly around post discussion. Is this a mailing list discussion, or something else?

 16:07:12 <m_3> arosales: it's probably a "make the change and then deal with the fallout" item.. I _think_ this is on track with milestone freezes

 16:07:13 <arosales> m_3:  for unit testing that may be applicable against different providers

 16:07:34 <arosales> m_3:  ok thanks.

 16:07:37 <arosales> and one more juju related bp

 16:07:52 <arosales> m_3: any updates on charm best practices progress, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:08:15 <arosales> Ursinha: any updates on reports for bug triage process for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:08:23 <m_3> arosales: more jitsu to add to best practices :)

 16:09:10 <arosales> m_3:  lots of todos for that one still

 16:09:25 <arosales> may need to ping jcastro nad possible hazmat

 16:09:40 <arosales> smoser and utlemming: any update on cloud-utils https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils

 16:09:40 <m_3> arosales: I'll take a look and update this week

 16:10:03 <arosales> m_3: thanks, be good to get a better grasp on the juju related items for this cycle.

 16:10:11 <smoser> not a lot of updates there.

 16:10:12 <arosales> smoser and utlemming: any update on cloud-utils https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils

 16:10:22 <arosales> sorry, duplicate

 16:10:28 <arosales> smoser since rbasak is out I think he was trying to set up a proof of concept for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-apt-improvements any other updates?

 16:11:09 <smoser> arosales, he has spent time on that.

 16:11:13 <smoser> and its in reasonable shape.

 16:11:26 <smoser> i'm not sure of tatus byhond that. other than we have the general plan laid out and even mostly agreed to

 16:11:52 <arosales> ok, I think rbasak was working on testing the prof of concept and getting feedback into the bug.

 16:11:59 <arosales> will catch up on that with rbasak returns

 16:12:01 <arosales> utlemming: are the RT tickets for the provisioning complete for https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-push-to-the-clouds

 16:12:28 <utlemming> arosales: more or less...I'm going full steam on the new build server now

 16:12:51 <utlemming> arosales: I am still waiting on the public Jenkins instance for pushing results out.

 16:13:19 <arosales> utlemming: ok, thanks

 16:13:22 <arosales> I'll follow up with Ursinha`about reports for bug triage. I think were were targeting A3 for that to be complete.

 16:13:22 <jamespage> utlemming, presumably thats not blocking this work tho?

 16:13:42 <utlemming> jamespage: no...its not

 16:13:44 <jamespage> arosales, yes - but that was a nominal date I chose.

 16:14:25 <arosales> jamespage: gotcha, we can probably slip that a bit. I know Ursinha` has been doing a lot of work on her gravity reports

 16:14:37 <arosales> zul: onto bugs?

 16:14:43 <jamespage> arosales, which probably add more long term value anyway...

 16:15:04 <arosales> yup

 16:15:13 <zul> arosales: ye

 16:15:20 <arosales> bug 1014005

 16:15:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1014005 in ipxe (Ubuntu) "Please generate and include ipxe.dsk to the ipxe binary package" [Wishlist,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1014005

 16:15:36 <arosales> wishlist still it looks like

 16:16:16 <zul> arosales: ill fixe that up

 16:16:18 <arosales> adam_g: targeting A3?

 16:16:23 <arosales> zul: thanks

 16:16:40 <arosales> another quantum bug 1025203

 16:16:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1025203 in quantum (Ubuntu) "Trying to overwrite '/etc/quantum/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_quantum_plugin.ini', which is also in package quantum-server" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1025203

 16:16:54 <zul> another one for me i guess

 16:17:49 <jamespage> o/

 16:18:02 <jamespage> I second smoser's opinion on this bug

 16:18:22 <jamespage> its never going to be fixed - so please can we just 'Won't Fix' it

 16:18:28 <jamespage> upstream don't think its a bug

 16:18:42 <jamespage> any opinions?

 16:18:45 <arosales> jamespage: any other place we should document this besides the bug?

 16:19:01 <zul> README.Debian perhaps

 16:19:01 <jamespage> I don't think so

 16:19:19 <jamespage> zul, a warning sort of statement?

 16:19:27 <zul> jamespage: yeah

 16:19:44 <jamespage> zul, I guess that makes sense

 16:20:04 <zul> jamespage: one liner is good enough

 16:20:16 <jamespage> roaksoax, would you be OK todo that for quantal?

 16:20:27 <jamespage> we don't need to fix in released version IMHO

 16:20:46 <roaksoax> jamespage: +1

 16:23:01 <arosales> thats it for http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:31:52 <jamespage> other than that everything else assigned to individuals on the in-flight list is either pending acceptance into -proposed

 16:32:57 <adam_g> jamespage: just got the SRU proposed yesterday, so..

 16:33:10 <jamespage> adam_g, great - we probably should add that to the server package list

 16:33:13 <jamespage> I'll do that

 16:33:22 <zul> anything else?

 16:33:40 <zul> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:35:14 <arosales> m_3: ok. I see that is Nov 1-3 too

 16:35:30 <m_3> yeah, it overlapped with something more important iirc

 16:35:41 <zul> m_3: traveling salesman

 16:35:45 <m_3> I know

 16:35:51 <m_3> totally

 16:35:58 <zul> with the bibles or knives

 16:36:12 <arosales> juju, so both

 16:36:14 <m_3> traveling "bite my nails because mark likes to do live demos" guy

 16:36:26 <zul> lol

 16:36:31 <zul> anytthing else?

 16:36:48 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:36:54 <zul> hi hggdh or random qa person

 16:37:32 <zul> anything qa relevant

 16:37:42 <zul> iso should be testing...ah that brings me back

 16:37:50 <zul> if not

 16:37:58 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:38:00 <zul> hi smb

 16:38:11 <smb> hia

 16:38:13 <smb> I attended the kernel-team spring in Portland last week. Apart from a, err, minor panic situation for Oneric 32bit cloud-images, I was persuading to fix the Xen package for Precise. The crash kernel issues are now at least understood (big initrd and wasting memory in any way is not well taken). Hopefully the kernel-part for Qunatal will make progress upstream. Otherwise, are there questions?

 16:38:15 <smb> ..

 16:39:04 <zul> any other questions?

 16:39:09 <utlemming> for the panic situation

 16:39:37 <utlemming> the good news is that both QA and Ubuntu Server are now tracking -proposed in automated testing to make sure we don't have to panic in the future.

 16:39:58 <zul> cool beans

 16:40:05 <arosales> utlemming: nice \o/

 16:40:17 <utlemming> for those interested, we have an incident report at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IncidentReports/2012-07-19-oneiric-kernel-regression-kills-EC2-instances

 16:40:30 <zul> yay xen!

 16:40:34 <zul> i love it

 16:41:01 <smb> Always a source of joy... :)

 16:41:12 <zul> and male pattern baldness

 16:41:22 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:41:32 <zul> can we skip this part since rbasak is on holiday

 16:41:45 <zul> or does anyone have any arm related stuff?

 16:42:00 <zul> if you want to try arm images on openstack you can do so through trystack.org now

 16:42:15 <jamespage> that works quite well - alot faster than my pandaboard

 16:42:24 <zul> i should hope so

 16:43:04 <zul> #topic Open Discussion

 16:43:25 <zul> anything people want to talk about

 16:43:50 <zul> if not

 16:43:52 <arosales> Call for testing

 16:44:16 <arosales> server on A3

 16:44:23 <jamespage> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2012-July/006359.html

 16:44:36 <arosales> jamespage: ah, thank you

 16:45:52 <arosales> zul: seems like we can wrap it up then

 16:45:56 <zul> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:46:02 <zul> same bat channel same bat place

 16:46:04 <zul> #endmeeting
