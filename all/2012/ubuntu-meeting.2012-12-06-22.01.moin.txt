 22:05:08 <cjohnston> kdub: give me just a second and then you can go

 22:06:20 <cjohnston> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for December 6 2012. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:06:25 <cjohnston> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:06:31 <cjohnston> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:06:34 <cjohnston> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:06:43 <cjohnston> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:06:51 <cjohnston> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:06:56 <cjohnston> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:07:00 <cjohnston> kdub: that's you... tell us about yourself

 22:07:15 <kdub> ok, here's my wiki:

 22:08:04 <cjohnston> #voters micahg

 22:08:04 <meetingology> Current voters: PabloRubianes Pendulum cjohnston hggdh iulian micahg

 22:08:13 <kdub> I've been involved in open source, mostly as a coder for the past many years. my primary ubuntu community activity is organizing meetings for the california loco for the san diego area

 22:08:44 <hggdh> and https://launchpad.net/~kdub

 22:08:44 <kdub> I've been involved in a couple upstream projects like compiz/vlc/ffmpeg off and on for a while now

 22:08:55 <kdub> ah yes, and that is my launchpad

 22:08:57 <kdub> thanks hggdh

 22:09:01 <hggdh> yw

 22:10:03 <micahg> kdub: have you ever considered contributing to Ubuntu development directly?

 22:10:37 <kdub> a while back (a few years) i tried my hand at some packaging for some optical character recognition applications

 22:10:54 <kdub> i've handed off their maintenence since then though, never got into the swing of it

 22:12:20 <kdub> some other things, was involved with the michigan loco from the time it started in about 2006 until i moved to california

 22:12:57 <kdub> and then started organizing some san diego ubuntu hours (there weren't any in my city)

 22:13:21 <cjohnston> kdub: I think we are ready to vote.

 22:15:38 <cjohnston> #topic m_3's Ubuntu Membership Application

 22:15:44 <cjohnston> m_3: your up

 22:15:49 <m_3> Hi Y'all

 22:16:01 <m_3> I'm Mark Mims... wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkMims

 22:16:28 <m_3> I'm on the Juju Ecosystem Team

 22:16:56 <m_3> I write charms, teach charmschools, and help others integrate juju/charms into their current devops workflow

 22:17:28 <m_3> Part of that work involves going to conferences to talk and do booth-duty

 22:18:14 <m_3> I've done a bit of packaging... mostly in juju-related things (juju,juju-jitsu, charm-tools, charm-helpers)

 22:18:31 <m_3> but also outside of it things like ppas for hadoop, reconnoiter

 22:18:39 <cjohnston> What's this juju thing?

 22:18:56 <m_3> and then I've had some uploads sponsored for ganglia

 22:19:01 <m_3> cjohnston: ha!

 22:19:05 <m_3> funny you should ask... :)

 22:19:25 <cjohnston> juju deploy dinner -e office

 22:19:30 <m_3> cjohnston and I charmed up the summit app for the last LinuxPlumbers conf

 22:19:34 <hggdh> heh

 22:19:52 * jcastro_ is here in support of m_3's application!

 22:20:12 <m_3> That's pretty much all I can remember about myself at this point of the day

 22:20:18 * hggdh wonders who is jcastro_ ... ;-)

 22:20:19 <m_3> any questions on stuff?

 22:21:49 <hggdh> m_3: please wait a bit, backstage discussions

 22:21:53 <m_3> np

 22:22:49 <iulian> m_3: What area of physics are you a geek of?

 22:23:11 <m_3> I studied quantum computation

 22:23:28 <m_3> how much noise quantum algorithms can tolerate before being as slow as the classical versions

 22:23:48 <m_3> now I'm back in a physics department at USU and working more on distributed computing topics

 22:23:56 <Pendulum> m_3: have you interacted with the Ubuntu community for things other than charms or has that been the majority of your involvement?

 22:24:39 <m_3> Pendulum: I've packaged some things too... some of those out of deps for charms... some of those things out of just pure interest

 22:25:10 <iulian> m_3: Ah, boring. I was about to ask you a topological quantum field theory question but that's not really related. :)

 22:25:18 <m_3> lots of big data related stuff now like hadoop and r

 22:34:37 <cjohnston> #topic ttoine's Membership Application

 22:34:49 <cjohnston> ttoine: your up

 22:34:52 <solarcloud_3scre> What meeting is this for exactl;y ?

 22:34:57 <ttoine> helloa all

 22:35:06 <ttoine> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ttoine

 22:35:13 <iulian> solarcloud_3scre: See topic.

 22:35:28 <PabloRubianes> Vamo !!!

 22:35:29 <ttoine> I started to use Ubuntu at its very beginning, with Dapper

 22:35:35 * holstein would like to thank ttoine for helping the ubuntustudio team.. here to show support!

 22:36:01 <ttoine> As a musician, I worked on how to produce music with free software, and the simplicity of Ubuntu started to be my new base

 22:36:11 * solarcloud_3scre doesn't understand what 'membership' relates to ?

 22:36:23 <ttoine> I am not a developper with programmation skills

 22:36:33 <cjohnston> solarcloud_3scre: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership

 22:36:54 <ttoine> but I spend much of my time testing hardware, finding the key developper etc. to be sure that everything is working

 22:37:19 <ttoine> I am one of the founder of Ubuntu Studio, and still there to make it alive

 22:37:41 <solarcloud_3scre> "Membership is not required for contribution, but contribution is required for membership." this is an Odd meeting. :\

 22:37:47 <ttoine> I spend a lot of my free time on workshops, etc.

 22:38:38 <holstein> solarcloud_3scre: feel free and PM me if you have more questions.. otherwise a meeting is in progress. cheers

 22:39:56 <Pendulum> ttoine: Is there a reason that you've waited this long to apply for membership?

 22:39:58 <czajkowski> solarcloud_3scre: I did ask you not to interrupt their meeting

 22:40:44 <ttoine> Pendulum, I just didn't seen what use I could have

 22:41:00 * zequence is also here to show support for ttoine

 22:41:13 <ttoine> but know that I am working on developping the Ubuntu Studio community, I clearly see the interest

 22:41:52 <Pendulum> ttoine: What have you been doing more recently? It feels like as far as documentation of your involvement goes, there was quite a bit a few years ago, but then a chunk in the middle where we don't see much until the last very short while?

 22:43:09 <ttoine> As i say I am not skilled with packaging etc.

 22:43:34 <micahg> ttoine: that's a different board ;)

 22:43:37 <ttoine> So I spend time with finding information, testing application in workflows

 22:43:46 <zequence> Recently ttoine has been involved in the Ubuntu Studio PR team, which is not yet actively creating news. ttoine will be a key person in that team

 22:44:13 <holstein> ttoine is working with creating a public relations team for ubuntustudio. trying to help us attract new users and team members

 22:44:37 <micahg> zequence: right, but membership is based on past contributions, not future ones (though we hope they continue)

 22:44:56 <ttoine> micahg, I have past contributions

 22:44:57 <Pendulum> holstein: how long has ttoine been working with you on Ubuntu Studio?

 22:45:12 <ttoine> and my current work for Ubuntu Studio can not be seen on launchpad

 22:45:13 <zequence> ttoine has been helping us define what that team is to do, by doing research etc

 22:45:28 <micahg> ttoine: right, but as Pendulum mentioned, there's this gap we're trying to piece together where it ended

 22:46:03 <holstein> Pendulum: this past cycle is when i noticed input.. though ttoine was around the project before i was there

 22:47:33 <ttoine> micahg, because on my wiki page, there is only "since 2007" ?

 22:48:15 <cjohnston> ttoine: I don't see anything in Launchpad or on the wiki page to show anything that you have been doing recently.

 22:48:57 <ttoine> cjohnston, because I am working on the community management at the moment

 22:49:01 <Pendulum> ttoine: we see that it says "since 2007", but we're only hearing testimonials from people who are saying "a couple months". No one is hear backing you up that you've been doing work consistantly since 2007

 22:49:58 <cjohnston> ttoine: do you have anything that you can show me with that?

 22:50:09 <micahg> From my IRC logs, I see activity from Mar/Apr this year, then mostly a break, then Nov on again

 22:50:18 <micahg> in #ubuntustudio-devel

 22:51:10 <ttoine> cjohnston, we are working on the moment at the creation of ubuntu studio pages on facebook, G+, twitter

 22:51:49 <ttoine> and about what we should post and where

 22:52:34 <cjohnston> The ubuntu studio page on facebook was created on 2/23/08

 22:52:46 <ttoine> the aim is to create a community of users and developpers. That' what I have always ask to the team, but it is quite recent as a goal. Mainly because in the past, we needed a lot of programmation skills

 22:53:03 <ttoine> for this summer, I had a surgery of shoulder and was off until I can work again

 22:53:45 <holstein> i know for me, i want ubuntustudio to have a venue for helping attract new users and developers.. and contribute upstream

 22:54:00 <cjohnston> I agree with that holstein

 22:54:01 <holstein> i think ttoine is trying to help us envision that goal

 22:54:35 <holstein> its a small team though.. and we have lots of developing contributors, but few contributing developers. if you know what i mean

 22:54:49 <ttoine> cjohnston, because I don't package and write code, you can't see my involvement, that's the point ?

 22:55:34 <hggdh> ttoine: no, not at all. What we are missing is this gap in the middle. And more testimonials covering it

 22:55:34 <Pendulum> ttoine: That's why we're asking about people who can testify on the amount of time/work you've done in the last year or os

 22:56:15 <holstein> i hope that through getting news out and having folks on the team like ttoine who are commiting to helping us shape our public image, we can better attract what we need

 22:56:44 <ttoine> hggdh, a big part of the Ubuntu Studio team has leave at the time current team leader started to lead

 22:57:20 <zequence> ttoine was very much involved in filling this page with content https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/PublicRelations

 22:57:22 <ttoine> I am one of the last team member from the original team. That's why nobodyd can testify for this period

 22:57:38 <zequence> ..which is the preparation work for our public relations team

 22:58:11 <micahg> zequence: I see no edits from him, mostly you and ScottL

 22:58:19 <micahg> or rather all you and ScottL

 22:58:28 <micahg> and that page is only 1.5 months old

 22:58:34 <zequence> micahg: I've copied and pasted the text from a whiteboard for a blueprint, which ttoine helped put together

 22:58:40 <ttoine> micahg, a lot of things have been discussed with me on irc

 22:59:19 <zequence> ..and we did edit the page some more after that, of course

 22:59:22 <micahg> right, but again, that leaves us with the last couple months

 22:59:28 <ttoine> launchpad is not my favourite place

 22:59:59 <ttoine> micahg, that's right

 23:00:29 <ttoine> but think that between to release period, there is a lot of time where people like me are not very needed for developement

 23:00:35 <Pendulum> ttoine: We think you've done some good work. While we feel like we cannot approve you at this time, we'd really like you to gather some more testimonials for the time you've spent working in the last year or so and then reapply.

 23:01:12 <Pendulum> You don't need more things on launchpad, just more people who can say that they've witnessed at least 6 months of sustained contribution, please.

 23:01:25 <ttoine> Pendulum, ok

 23:01:50 <Pendulum> ttoine: if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the board. I'm also happy to go over your wiki page with you if you contact me at pendulum@ubuntu.com

 23:02:07 <ttoine> Pendulum, I don't any question

 23:02:43 <cjohnston> Thanks to everyone for coming to the meeting and congrats to those who were accepted.
