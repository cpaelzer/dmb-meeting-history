 18:01:15 <AlanBell> hi all and welcome to the meeting o/

 18:01:17 <AlanBell> who is here?

 18:01:19 <Pici> aloha

 18:01:34 <Pici> hm.

 18:03:13 <Myrtti> hello

 18:05:03 <Pici> I guess we'll wait a few more minutes...

 18:05:11 <AlanBell> well this is awfully quiet

 18:05:32 <Pici> Well, it is a beautiful day out, at least here.

 18:05:54 <AlanBell> raining here

 18:06:01 <JanC> and in many countries this is probably a "long weekend"

 18:06:21 <AlanBell> we have a drought apparently, complete with hosepipe ban. It has barely stopped raining for a month.

 18:06:33 <Pici> 16C/61F and sunny here.

 18:08:05 <Myrtti> ground water takes some time to refill from rain

 18:09:01 <ikonia> the UK is drowning, so the UK guys should be here

 18:10:00 * AlanBell is building an ark

 18:10:07 <ikonia> wise

 18:11:14 <AlanBell> not going to forget the dinosaurs this time

 18:12:48 <Myrtti> AlanBell: ah, so you're taking your chickens with, good plan.

 18:13:28 <AlanBell> friendly little dinosaurs

 18:13:41 <Myrtti> kluck kluck kluck

 18:15:57 <AlanBell> here is the agenda https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/IrcCouncil/MeetingAgenda

 18:16:27 <AlanBell> think we might put it off for a few days, any pressing items to discuss right now?

 18:17:16 <Pici> There were a few things that jussi wanted to discuss, but even hes not here.

 18:17:49 <Pici> Do we have a time-frame for a UDS meeting? or for the intra-council meeting?

 18:18:44 <AlanBell> not yet

 18:21:04 <AlanBell> I will find out

 18:21:17 <AlanBell> I think we should reschedule this meeting for some time this week

 18:21:44 <Pici> I think thats a good idea.

 18:22:25 <Myrtti> btw the quatzal repositories are open already

 18:23:42 <AlanBell> any preferred day?

 18:23:46 <Myrtti> on related note in the past the -r-p was open for a bit longer than just few days because different locos have parties on the following weekend(s), but I do agree that this time closing it was a good idea

 18:23:52 <AlanBell> think I have a drinks evening of some sort on Tuesday

 18:25:05 <Pici> AlanBell: Anything *should* work fine for me.

 18:29:05 <jussi> Im now here

 18:29:09 <jussi> :/

 18:29:12 <AlanBell> hi jussi

 18:29:16 <jussi> hi

 18:30:43 * AlanBell wonders about rescheduling for tomorrow

 18:31:01 <jussi> probably hard for me as Im travelling tomorrow

 18:31:14 <jussi> wednes day could be good

 18:33:15 <AlanBell> how about Wednesday from 19:00 to 20:00 UTC which slots between jono's home videocast and the lubuntu team meeting on the fridge calendar?

 18:34:10 <Unit193> Awesome, I didn't miss anything.

 18:36:06 <AlanBell> ok, that is in the calendar now

 18:36:50 <Pici> Sounds good to me.
