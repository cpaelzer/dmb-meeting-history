 16:17:23 <ttx> should be out today or early tomorrow

 16:17:29 <jamespage> roaksoax, are you going to have time to pickup bug 967430?

 16:18:10 <jamespage> great

 16:18:24 <roaksoax> assigning it to myself

 16:18:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova and glance should depend on python-keystone" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:19:09 <adam_g> jamespage: still waiting on the keystone MIR to create the direct Depends

 16:19:38 <zul> jamespage: im hoping next week for that one

 16:19:45 <jamespage> zul: ack

 16:20:15 <jamespage> scans the rest of the list....

 16:20:49 <jamespage> there are a few FTBFS that need dealing with - genshi is already on the report

 16:21:18 <jamespage> but I also saw pacemaker and heartbeat in the latest rebuild test....

 16:21:27 <jamespage> I'll get bugs raised and them added to the list...

 16:21:47 <jamespage> #action jamespage to raise bugs for FTBFS for server related packages from latest rebuild test.

 16:21:47 * meetingology jamespage to raise bugs for FTBFS for server related packages from latest rebuild test.

 16:21:56 <adam_g> i fixed the cluster-glue build last night, that should resolve the pacemaker + heartbeat builds. is there a way to re-trigger those without a new upload to each, now that the dependency is fixed?

 16:22:00 <roaksoax> uhmm I though I had fixed pacemaker's FTBFS

 16:22:31 <jamespage> http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-20120328-precise.html

 16:22:55 <jamespage> roaksoax, looks like there is a new one :-)

 16:22:57 <roaksoax> adam_g: yes, with a no change upload. I'll take care of it

 16:23:10 <adam_g> thanks

 16:23:18 <jamespage> those two packages both have the same issue - glibc headers have changed structure...

 16:23:42 <jamespage> memcached is also failing tests on i386 - I'm looking at that

 16:23:43 <adam_g> the issue was in the cluster-glue library they build against, which is fixed now. they should both build okay

 16:24:15 <jamespage> MIR's - zul: sounds like keystone should be complete in the next week or so?

 16:24:23 <zul> hopefully

 16:24:35 <zul> i think most of the issues have been resolved, horizon is next on the list i think

 16:24:41 <roaksoax> adam_g: awesome!

 16:24:59 <jamespage> roaksoax, how about the cobbler MIR?

 16:26:06 <roaksoax> jamespage: looking at it now

 16:26:32 <roaksoax> jamespage: jdstrand has it assigned so I guess he's conducting his review work on it, or he will soon

 16:26:38 <jamespage> great

 16:26:55 <roaksoax> MAAS is also queued

 16:27:15 <jamespage> Final Freeze kicks in on the 12th of April which is only 9 days away

 16:27:18 <jamespage> busy busy busy!

 16:27:19 <roaksoax> s/queued/waiting for final review after commends/

 16:28:04 <jamespage> I did have a quick scan through these before the meeting

 16:34:01 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:34:10 <smb> Hi. I think I found another thing where libvirt does not exactly do the right things with xen. Affecting HVM guests. Luckily it is not fatal-

 16:34:22 <smb> Need to dig a bit more there.

 16:34:27 <smb> Beside that...

 16:34:33 <smb> Daviey, iscsitarget?

 16:34:39 <zul> iscsitarget?

 16:34:59 <jamespage> smb: iscsitarget?

 16:38:11 <rbasak> It looks good

 16:38:32 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 16:38:59 <jamespage> I have one item to raise

 16:39:15 <jamespage> Ursinha has now fixed the Triage Report - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/triage-report.html

 16:39:26 <Ursinha> \o/

 16:39:50 <jamespage> we have alot of 'New' bugs - bugs which have been assigned a priority but triaged no further than that.

 16:39:55 <jamespage> about 260 of them

 16:40:04 <jamespage> (thanks Ursinha)

 16:40:29 <hallyn> tnachen: \o

 16:40:58 <zul> jamespage: keeping you busy i see :)

 16:41:00 <jamespage> it would be great if people can ensure that these get some focus of the next week or so - specifically anything that might be an issue in precise

 16:41:09 <jamespage> I found at least three this morning

 16:41:23 <hallyn> tnachen is looking at getting involved with ubuntu server, and managed to sit through this whole meeting.  just wanted to introduce him

 16:41:36 <jamespage> hi tnachen: welcome!

 16:41:45 <tnachen> hi all, I emailed to ubuntu-server about the mentor program I saw on the wiki

 16:42:00 <tnachen> and hallyn gladly to volunteer to lead the newbie (me)

 16:42:12 <tnachen> I'll be working with him to learn more about libvirt and hopefully contribute!

 16:42:17 <jamespage> \o/

 16:42:27 <hallyn> i second that exuberance

 16:42:31 <rbasak> I'm waiting on bug 968753 to be sponsored - it looks like an issue with ssh on precise but on i386 only. I presume it'll be picked up in time.

 16:42:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 968753 in openssh (Ubuntu) "ssh crashed with SIGSEGV" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/968753

 16:43:08 <rbasak> (it got reported over the weekend with a pile of dupes)

 16:43:28 <jamespage> rbasak, poke someone if it does not get picked up before the weekend

 16:43:37 <rbasak> jamespage: will do, thanks
