 16:05:23 <jimbaker> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:05:50 <Daviey> (m_3, were there any actions last week?)

 16:06:05 <jimbaker> jamespage, you were to look into aligning release team and server team trackign reports?

 16:06:13 <arosales> our logs are looking a little behind https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server

 16:06:24 <jamespage> still looking at two reports - that can be dropped

 16:06:27 <jimbaker> (i'm just following ye old cut & paste here...)

 16:06:46 <arosales> jimbaker: thats the right direction :-)

 16:07:17 <jimbaker> were there any other action points i should be aware of?

 16:07:42 <jimbaker> seeing none...

 16:07:49 <zul> heylo

 16:08:03 <jimbaker> #topic Quantal Development

 16:08:51 <m_3_> Daviey: yes... don't know where they are though

 16:08:55 <jimbaker> arosales, you're right, the logs are not there from the last 2 meetings

 16:09:10 <arosales> logs from previous meeting are at http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-09-18-16.07.html

 16:09:16 <m_3_> did the meeting chair need to do something to make that happen?  #fail

 16:09:18 <arosales> or http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-09-18-16.07.moin.txt

 16:09:29 <rbasak> We need a checklist for meeting chairs to follow

 16:09:36 <arosales> jamespage look into running server with no elbow-room

 16:09:37 <rbasak> At the moment I get the impression that everyone does something slightly different

 16:09:38 <hallyn> we have one

 16:09:55 <arosales> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase#Team_policy under "IRC"

 16:09:58 <m_3_> it was great copy/paste command cheatsheet (thanks serge!)

 16:10:03 <arosales> rbasak: ^

 16:10:19 <rbasak> Aha. thanks!

 16:10:22 <jimbaker> rbasak, that's the listing i'm following

 16:10:22 <arosales> so to back up one minute before quantal development

 16:10:27 <Daviey> Anyone would think this is the first time we've done this....

 16:10:41 <arosales> I think we covered jamespage to look into aligning release team and server team trackign reports

 16:10:48 * m_3_ whistles innocently

 16:10:53 <arosales> jamespage: any update on running server with no elbow-room

 16:11:09 <arosales> and investigate minimum memory requirements for i386 and amd64 server installs

 16:11:16 <jamespage> arosales, lots of analysis of actuall install sizes - things have def grown

 16:11:34 <jamespage> I'm going to request a document update that they propose we discuss the size targets at UDS

 16:11:42 <jamespage> that/then

 16:12:08 <jamespage> did any of that make sense?

 16:12:18 <jimbaker> jamespage, made eminent sense to me

 16:12:19 <jamespage> 1. Update docs to align with current size of installs

 16:12:28 <jamespage> 2. discuss at UDS if this needs attention

 16:13:00 <arosales> jamespage: do we need to continue investigating min memory for server installs?

 16:13:13 <jamespage> arosales, I think cjwatson is looking at that

 16:13:26 <jamespage> again I don't really have any objection to increasing the mins in the docs

 16:14:21 <jimbaker> jamespage, ok. what about bug 1049582?

 16:14:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1049582 in ceph (Ubuntu) "radosgw crash on armhf architecture" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1049582

 16:14:35 <arosales> jamespage: ok so perhaps tie that into the doc BP.

 16:14:39 <jamespage> testing a fix ATM

 16:14:42 <cjwatson> jamespage: yeah, got a kanban card for that which has pretty much risen to the top of my stack

 16:14:46 <cjwatson> probably won't fit into b2

 16:15:03 <jamespage> cjwatson, I don't think thats an issue

 16:15:12 <jamespage> (that it won't fit in b2)

 16:15:23 <cjwatson> I have an objection to increasing the minima in the docs before I've had a chance to review and adjust the limits in the software

 16:15:26 <cjwatson> fwiw

 16:15:39 <cjwatson> because the latter will likely affect the former

 16:15:56 <Daviey> cjwatson: Do you have an ETA?

 16:16:10 <cjwatson> this week

 16:16:29 <cjwatson> (since I anticipate lots of interruptions from b2)

 16:16:50 <Daviey> super

 16:16:53 <Daviey> thanks

 16:17:19 <jimbaker> any other updates on quantal dev? (i will go next otherwise on juju bugs)

 16:18:05 <jimbaker> so we have 3 critical bugs in progress on juju, https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju, that i'm working on

 16:19:17 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/0.6 gives a nice overall picture of the target release we have

 16:19:19 <jimbaker> i have identified the underlying problem for 2 out of 3 (openstack token expiry, relation state not found) and the third looks similar to a bug i fixed in juju in the past

 16:19:23 <SpamapS> (which, btw, was due yesterday)

 16:19:38 <SpamapS> jimbaker: can you mark those as In Progress if you are indeed working on them?

 16:20:05 <SpamapS> I plan to start dropping anything not In Progress tomorrow.

 16:20:14 <jimbaker> SpamapS, in the sense of, i'm working on too many things, yes :)

 16:20:36 <jimbaker> but i will reprioritize them so we can hit that deadline, nothing is big

 16:22:42 <SpamapS> jimbaker: we already missed the deadline.. we need to land and ship now and also apply for a FFE for quantal

 16:23:12 <jimbaker> SpamapS, understood

 16:23:32 <jimbaker> any other release bugs we should be considering at this time?

 16:24:02 <hallyn> qxl driver

 16:24:19 <hallyn> don't think a bug has been opened yet, but i'll work on it this afternoon (after meeting)

 16:24:33 <hallyn> stgraber found that qxl drive is not working right in quantal dvd image

 16:24:45 <SpamapS> there's a really nasty bug in lxc

 16:24:51 <hallyn> oh?

 16:24:56 <SpamapS> we talked about it yesterday

 16:25:01 <SpamapS> NS refcount thing

 16:25:02 <hallyn> oh.  that's not in lxc

 16:25:12 <SpamapS> when it hits, you are screwed, LXC no longer works and you can't even properly reboot

 16:25:13 <hallyn> smb is helping coolonely to look into it

 16:25:15 <SpamapS> sorry

 16:25:17 <SpamapS> kernel

 16:25:19 <smb> SpamapS, yep

 16:25:29 <hallyn> we can hopefully get an update ina few mins :)

 16:25:38 * SpamapS considers it LXC since LXC is what makes it happen

 16:25:47 <hallyn> so would vsftpd

 16:26:04 <smb> hallyn, Yes insofar that I cannot say more right now as I just started to think about it today

 16:26:15 <jimbaker> good to know we are finding root causes :)

 16:26:17 <hallyn> smb: ok

 16:27:40 <jimbaker> hallyn, so maybe action item you will file the qxl bug?

 16:27:55 <hallyn> jimbaker: k with me

 16:28:04 <hallyn> and hopefully resolve it too :)

 16:28:19 <jimbaker> #action hallyn files and ideally resolves qxl bug... all in the same day!

 16:28:19 * meetingology hallyn files and ideally resolves qxl bug... all in the same day!

 16:29:01 <hallyn> me and my big mouth

 16:29:11 <jimbaker> SpamapS, same with the lxc bug, so we know it's linked to the namespace (i take it) refcounting?

 16:29:31 <hallyn> jimbaker: that has open bug already, on kernel team's hotlist

 16:29:33 <smb> bug There are currently (at least) two design/technical decisions which have a quite bad impact on running Ubuntu desktop in a virtual machine:

 16:29:33 <smb> 1) Dropping unity2d in favour of unity+llvmpipe. Since there is no way (at least none that is easy to find) to disable playful effects this puts a considerable stress on the emulated cpu(s). On my desktop, which may not be state of the art but used to be usable for running unity2d desktops in VMs, doing even simple tasks is painfully slow. For example it takes about 3s(!) from when a window begins to fade in until it can be used. And the same

 16:29:33 <smb> when minimizing. On that machine I also see a lot of X crashes which might be related to overwhelming the cpus (bug 1056080) since a faster machine does not seem to suffer that badly.

 16:29:35 <ubottu> Error: Bug #1056080 is a duplicate of bug #1048304, but it is private (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1048304)

 16:29:36 <smb> 2) Adding the Amazon search to the dash search (again without any reasonably easy way to disable this). This further puts stress on the cpu(s) and on the same desktop every keypress is delayed about one second (at least). It also adds to network usage (not to mention any privacy or potential parental control issues).

 16:29:40 <smb> Those together currently make my experience rather bad. To get anything done within the desktop vm I seem to drag my feet through a pool of mud. And that is just one VM running. Anybody hosting virtual desktops will rip out lots of hair and likely leave for at least the ubuntu-gnome-desktop (classic unaccelerated) which would be rather sad and completely unhelpful in those cases where the ubuntu desktop was used in a VM for testing.

 16:29:47 <smb> I can understand that getting rid of a duplicated desktop framework will help to focus on the main unity project. But I think in that case there really should be options that allow to reduce the graphical overhead and the amount of feature overhead in a more user-friendly way.

 16:29:51 <smb> oops

 16:29:53 <smb> damn multi buffers

 16:30:00 <smb> bug 1021471

 16:30:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021471 in linux (Ubuntu Quantal) "clone() hang when creating new network namespace (dmesg show unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2)" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021471

 16:30:38 <jimbaker> smb, thanks for the link. actually i was thinking that SpamapS might put it in as a juju lxc provider bug since that's where we are observing it, so we can track as being impacted

 16:31:02 <SpamapS> smb: thanks for sharing tho!

 16:31:17 <utlemming> smb: I have follow-up on the cloud images

 16:31:19 <smb> no worries... sorry for the oversharing

 16:31:35 <SpamapS> jimbaker: nah, its all in the kernel.. I don't think we need to track it.

 16:31:36 <Daviey> a problem shared is a problem halved

 16:31:37 <utlemming> from last week -- about Unity working on the Desktop Images

 16:31:51 <jimbaker> SpamapS, cool

 16:32:02 <utlemming> short story: the Desktop Cloud images haven't had a desktop sharing solution since Oneiric. And Unity does not work on the desktop images.

 16:32:16 <utlemming> er -- unity does not work on the Desktop Cloud Images

 16:32:28 <jimbaker> utlemming, is this something actionable as a quantal release bug?

 16:33:16 <utlemming> jimbaker: no. The desktop cloud images are not supported. And for R, we're going to have a discussion about them.

 16:33:23 <smb> utlemming, As you probably noted from the involuntary ranting above I got somewhat depressed about the current situation running in a VM.

 16:33:39 <utlemming> smb: I noticed :)

 16:33:43 <jimbaker> utlemming, ok, just checking

 16:34:00 <jimbaker> any other bugs to discuss before blueprints subtopic?

 16:34:02 <jimbaker> ...

 16:34:28 <jimbaker> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:34:34 <jimbaker> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:35:47 <Daviey> gah, wrong link - try http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-overview.html

 16:37:05 <jimbaker> Daviey, thanks...

 16:38:11 <jimbaker> zul, any updates on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-qa ?

 16:38:19 <zul> jimbaker: no

 16:39:00 <jimbaker> m_3_, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices ?

 16:39:02 <jamespage> zul, adam_g: suggest we get together and decide what is going to happen for this cycle

 16:39:19 <zul> jamespage: sounds like a plan

 16:39:33 <jimbaker> m_3_, seems like there has been been some good mailing list activity re best practices

 16:39:54 <m_3_> looks good afaik

 16:39:56 <jimbaker> as well as documenting in the spreadsheet that jcastro put together

 16:40:37 <m_3_> some local container bugs outstanding (they'll be postponed most likely)

 16:40:45 <jimbaker> m_3_, right, just looks like this bp might need some corresponding updating

 16:40:53 <m_3_> ack

 16:41:40 <jimbaker> rbasak, any updates on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-deployment ?

 16:41:53 <rbasak> No updates. I'm still working on MAAS

 16:42:02 <jimbaker> rbasak, understood

 16:43:11 <jimbaker> SpamapS, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charmstore-maintenance, maintainer assignment is more or less done in place right?

 16:43:57 <SpamapS> Yes

 16:44:01 <SpamapS> updating

 16:44:09 <jimbaker> SpamapS, thanks!

 16:44:44 <jimbaker> i'm just looking at the clock and your novice chair is seriously running out of time here. everyone else, please see if you can update your BPs

 16:45:12 <jimbaker> any other BPs that should be discussed at this time? otherwise... moving on

 16:45:26 <jimbaker> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:46:17 <jimbaker> so i had a good presentation at the boulder big data user meetup - http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Denver-Big-Data/events/81123992/

 16:46:42 <jimbaker> 75 people or so showed up, something like 4 hours all together including presentation and questions before, after

 16:47:15 <arosales> Surge coming up on the 27th

 16:47:31 <jimbaker> arosales, who will be at surge?

 16:47:46 <SpamapS> hazmat

 16:47:48 <Daviey> Oct 15 -> 18. Many Ubuntu Server dev's will be at ODS - http://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/

 16:48:06 <SpamapS> Right, come to san diego, enjoy the beer. :)

 16:48:27 <jimbaker> SpamapS, it sounds like a very good plan :)

 16:48:28 <Daviey> Oct 29 -> 1st Nov.. UDS in Copenhagen.. Many Openstack dev's attending.

 16:48:41 <Daviey> (see what i did there? :)

 16:48:45 <zul> surge?

 16:49:08 <jimbaker> http://omniti.com/surge/2012

 16:49:12 * Daviey googles on behalf of zul

 16:49:13 <Daviey> http://omniti.com/surge/2012

 16:49:35 <hallyn> we need a 'tech conference' lens in the dash

 16:49:51 <smb> not more lenses... o_O

 16:49:59 <jimbaker> oh sure, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=surge :)

 16:50:01 <Daviey> jimbaker: can you action hallyn to make a lens ?

 16:50:12 <hallyn> NO

 16:50:19 <jimbaker> Daviey, i could in fact do that... it would be very cruel however

 16:50:42 <hallyn> s'ok i can delegate with the best of em

 16:50:43 <jimbaker> maybe what we really want a lens connected to http://lmgtfy.com/

 16:50:57 <Daviey> meh, logs can be edited to add it regardless.

 16:51:04 <hallyn> eh that looks nice

 16:51:05 <jimbaker> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:51:17 <hallyn> oh no it wants js, nm

 16:51:27 <hggdh> hello

 16:51:47 <hggdh> only thing to note is... it is beta2 week, so help testing is very welcome :-)

 16:52:01 <jimbaker> hggdh, thanks for that update

 16:52:09 <jimbaker> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:52:17 <smb> Yo!

 16:52:24 <smb> * I had been looking at bug 1023755. While I can see one potential

 16:52:24 <smb> problem, I could not reproduce the issue with the provided method.

 16:52:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1023755 in linux (Ubuntu) "Precise kernel locks up while dd to /dev/mapper files > 1Gb (was: Unable to delete volume)" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023755

 16:52:32 <smb> * Trying to also look into bug 1021471 this week. But wanted to

 16:52:32 <smb> complete other tasks before.

 16:52:32 <smb> Eric Biederman indicated two (inline) functions to check for

 16:52:32 <smb> balancing. Unfortunately those are "inline" so I need to build

 16:52:32 <smb> myself a debug kernel to do so.

 16:52:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021471 in linux (Ubuntu Quantal) "clone() hang when creating new network namespace (dmesg show unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2)" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021471

 16:52:43 <smb> * About bug 1038055: it looks like right now the way to go is to

 16:52:43 <smb> disable the drm qemu driver and go back to have X run by the

 16:52:44 <smb> cirrus driver (and hope it and llvm-pipe go together not too badly).

 16:52:44 <smb> Recent testing showed at least the initial startup crash been gone.

 16:52:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1038055 in linux (Ubuntu) "graphics fail to initialise correctly, in kvm with cirrus graphics (after LUKS install)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1038055

 16:52:52 <smb> * While trying to pry some useful data from a Xen dump I pulled a few

 16:52:53 <smb> patches to crash from the Xen mailing list and prepared an updated

 16:52:53 <smb> package: bug 1054200. Though that needs some sponsor/reviewer.

 16:52:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1054200 in crash (Ubuntu) "Pick some upstream patches for Xen" [Wishlist,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1054200

 16:53:00 <smb> and last but not least...

 16:53:05 <Daviey> drumroll

 16:53:08 <smb> * A certain person on the server team (starting with a capital D)

 16:53:08 <smb> has been cc'ed on a mail in the past that was asking for some

 16:53:08 <smb> patches pulled into the Xen package. While I may volunteer to

 16:53:08 <smb> do the dirty work, I am less inclined to do anything without the

 16:53:09 <smb> backing that this is acceptable at this stage (since some of the

 16:53:09 <smb> patches are introducing features). So as long as afore mentioned

 16:53:11 <smb> person remains silent on this mail exchange, I won't do anything. ;)

 16:53:30 <smb> ..

 16:53:34 <Daviey> smb: is that me?

 16:53:39 <smb> Yessir!

 16:53:54 <Daviey> smb: Subject?

 16:54:30 * smb wispers

 16:55:09 <Daviey> Ah, LP:1009098 AMD 12.10 Feature: Xen Recommended Patches

 16:55:10 <Daviey> thanks

 16:55:37 <jimbaker> cool, we are running quite late, so any bug followup with smb should happen outside of this channel

 16:55:42 <jimbaker> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:56:05 <jimbaker> rbasak, any updates here?

 16:56:06 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. I'm continuing to work on landing ARM support in MAAS trunk and it is going well. Any questions for me?

 16:56:33 <jimbaker> rbasak, sounds good to me, let's just follow up in #ubuntu-server

 16:56:45 <jimbaker> #topic Open Discussion

 16:58:05 <jimbaker> #topic Next meeting will be at the same time next week on Oct 2

 16:58:18 <arosales> Tuesday 2012-10-02 at 1600 UTC

 16:58:29 <jimbaker> arosales, thanks for the utc

 16:58:34 <arosales> jimbaker: Thanks for chairing :-)

 16:58:39 <Daviey> thanks jimbaker, great effort

 16:59:08 <jimbaker> thanks everyone, i really just can't wait to do it again ;)

 16:59:17 <arosales> :-)

 16:59:31 <jimbaker> but i believe the previous chair gets to reserve the right to pick the next one, right?

 16:59:35 <hallyn> a new permanent chair!

 16:59:38 <jamespage> ta jimbaker

 16:59:58 <jimbaker> #action jimbaker picks chair for next meeting on the fly next week!

 16:59:58 * meetingology jimbaker picks chair for next meeting on the fly next week!
