 15:02:36 <ara> #topic - Checkbox status in Precise

 15:02:51 <ara> OK, so let's sum up how things are looking for 12.04 in Checkbox

 15:03:19 <ara> 1) Checkbox Qt is untranslatable so far, but the tests are pretty much translated

 15:03:37 <ara> roadmr, any updates on the bug about Checkbox Qt not being translatable?

 15:06:13 <ara> roadmr, ?

 15:06:31 <roadmr> ara: sorry!

 15:06:49 <roadmr> ara: the merge request was approved a moment ago, I have to merge it and then prepare an Ubuntu upload for 0.13.6

 15:07:00 <roadmr> ara: I can have that ready today I expect

 15:07:21 <ara> roadmr, wow, I didn't now it has progressed that much! it is great news

 15:07:55 <roadmr> ara: yes, well ctf tested it quite thoroughly so we're confident it works well

 15:08:06 <ara> thanks roadmr, ctf :)

 15:08:50 <ara> 2) We will need to update the documentation on the friendly site: https://friendly.ubuntu.com/participate/

 15:08:55 <ara> to match the new interface

 15:09:57 <ara> 3) balloons is going to help us reaching the Ubuntu community to test their systems once 12.04 gets released :)

 15:10:29 <ara> ..

 15:10:43 <ara> anything else urgent that needs to be fixed (for sure) for 12.04?

 15:11:35 <ara> mmm, it doesn't look like it

 15:11:38 <ara> OK, moving on

 15:11:45 <ara> #topic Any other business?

 15:12:08 <roadmr> o/

 15:12:44 <ara> roadmr, go ahead :)

 15:13:21 <roadmr> yay! so where do we stand as far as strings (for instance, job descriptions) are concerned? because we're getting some bug reports from people testing beta2 which show some descriptions could use improving

 15:14:20 <ara> roadmr, if they are critical (i.e. if not changing them could turn into a 1 star submission), then we should fix them

 15:15:13 <ara> we would need translations freeze exception, but it is clear that we will need to fix some of those

 15:15:16 <roadmr> ara: they're just confusing :/ we could always argue that failures were due to misinterpretation %)

 15:15:52 <roadmr> I understand at this point changes affect other people (translators, who probably hate us by now)

 15:16:07 <roadmr> but still it's something to keep on the radar I think

 15:16:11 <roadmr> ok, that's all I had :)

 15:16:11 <roadmr> ..

 15:16:27 <ara> OK; thanks. I think that we might need to fix some of those :(

 15:16:37 <ara> so, we'd better fix them soon :)

 15:16:43 <ara> and yes, they should hate us by now

 15:17:07 <ara> but let's just fix those that really can turn a 3 stars to 1 star

 15:17:19 <ara> ..

 15:17:22 <ara> anything else?

 15:18:09 <ara> going once...

 15:18:47 <ara> going twice...

 15:19:24 <roadmr> ?!?

 15:19:39 <balloons> heh
