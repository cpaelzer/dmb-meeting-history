 17:07:51 <balloons> so who is here?

 17:07:52 <balloons> :-)

 17:08:02 <phillw> o/

 17:09:00 <phillw> hmm, gema was here 5 mins ago?

 17:09:15 <balloons> lol

 17:09:17 <balloons> yes..

 17:09:29 <gema> I will be on and off, sorry guys, I am cooking :)

 17:09:36 <balloons> I had hoped to get jibel and some others as well

 17:09:41 <balloons> yummy gem

 17:09:45 <gema> balloons: it is 7pm for jibel

 17:09:52 <balloons> ahh..

 17:09:56 <phillw> we'll be round in an hour :)

 17:10:00 <balloons> and for you

 17:10:04 <gema> 6pm

 17:10:19 <phillw> 6pm also

 17:10:20 <balloons> ok, so let's check the agenda

 17:10:40 <gema> hint: beta 2

 17:10:41 * balloons phillw to fix feb 29th log, merge them, and make the regex for meetings page display all the logs again (balloons, 16:07:36)

 17:10:52 * phillw done :)

 17:10:54 <MrChrisDruif> 7pm here

 17:10:56 <balloons> [TOPIC] Previous Actions

 17:11:09 <balloons> awesome phillw I see it's been done

 17:11:11 <balloons> looks good

 17:11:17 * balloons balloons to send results of poll and provide the most suitable timeframes for one last round of polling. (balloons, 16:19:01)

 17:11:32 <phillw> it was the best I could without spending hours on the merge

 17:11:52 <balloons> This I also did.. Which I trust will help us by moving the time to something more convinent for everyone

 17:12:15 <phillw> balloons: what was the decision?

 17:12:18 <balloons> so, let's talk about the results

 17:12:33 <balloons> this was round 1.. if you'll remember: http://whenisgood.net/mzs4etp/results/x83kbr

 17:12:53 <balloons> for round 2, we picked 1 time slot perday and got people to vote

 17:13:58 <balloons> I was waiting hoping the time would be broken, but sadly we had 2 votes each option monday, tuesday, weds, thursday

 17:14:01 <balloons> no friday votes

 17:14:12 <balloons> This is the form https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRBUjJ6ZVN0dk9YVDBvbmVhQ2VpQmc6MQ

 17:14:38 <balloons> So I'd like to make a decision now based upon that feedback, by also looking at the earlier survey to break the tie

 17:14:42 <balloons> make sense?

 17:15:15 <phillw> balloons: discard my vote... does that help enay?

 17:15:22 <phillw> *any*

 17:16:36 <balloons> heh

 17:16:38 <balloons> not really

 17:16:54 <balloons> I'm basically looking at doing it weds at 1400 I *think*

 17:17:20 <balloons> that gets us several people I know want to attend..

 17:17:35 <balloons> and is one of the best options from the survey

 17:17:58 <phillw> okies, weds 14:00 is fine by me :)

 17:18:09 <balloons> tues @ 1900 UTC is the other strong response

 17:18:20 <balloons> but our poor european friends.. it's already so late for them

 17:18:42 <phillw> hmm, yeah 8pm is well past food time!

 17:18:55 <balloons> so I guess 1400 it is

 17:19:00 <balloons> same day, earlier time

 17:19:38 <balloons> [ACTION] balloons to announce new time for QA meeting, 1400 UTC weds

 17:19:38 * meetingology balloons to announce new time for QA meeting, 1400 UTC weds

 17:19:51 <balloons> alrighty

 17:20:15 <balloons> so let's move on

 17:20:22 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Updates

 17:20:36 <balloons> I think gema dropped.. but as everyone knows it's beta 2 season

 17:20:43 <balloons> the beta should drop final tomorrow sometime

 17:21:19 <balloons> not much else to say.. the u+1 team has been busy helping out with iso testing

 17:21:35 <balloons> the lubuntu folks worked well last week with the ubiquity sprint

 17:21:41 <balloons> lots of good focused work being done

 17:21:46 <balloons> bugs squashed ;-)

 17:23:20 <balloons> roginac, kaldor and myself converted the checkbox tests to the new qt format and those will be used for the app testing after beta2 is released

 17:23:28 <balloons> the new gui is much nicer than the old gtk gui

 17:24:06 <balloons> as an fyi, the repo has migrated as well to https://code.launchpad.net/~nskaggs/checkbox/checkbox-app-testing-qt

 17:24:14 <balloons> questions?

 17:24:45 <balloons> ok.

 17:24:53 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Flavor Updates

 17:25:00 <balloons> phillw, I think it's just you on this one

 17:25:03 <balloons> :-)

 17:25:06 <balloons> anything to share

 17:25:06 <phillw> It has gone fantastically well, until we started counting chickens before they hatched and got stung with bug 967257 about an hour ago. Work is on going as we speak. 27th March was okay, so there is a fall back if needed.

 17:25:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 967257 in lubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "PPC Install CD from 28 Mar does not boot" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/967257

 17:25:46 <balloons> wow.. bizarre

 17:26:07 <phillw> a real pain.

 17:27:25 <balloons> I'll bet..

 17:27:47 <balloons> well.. I'd like to end this one early and plan for a big group next time :-)

 17:28:16 <phillw> fine :)

 17:28:40 <balloons> phillw, thanks for coming.. remember the new time

 17:28:46 <balloons> and we'll see more faces next week

 17:28:54 <balloons> #endmeeting
