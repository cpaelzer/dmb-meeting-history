 15:02:31 <skaet> #topic Questions and Comments

 15:04:09 <skaet> roadmr, gilir, stgraber, scott-work, astraljava, Riddell - is your flavor planning in participating in A3 next week?

 15:04:20 <stgraber> yep

 15:04:27 <gilir> yes

 15:04:29 <Riddell> stgraber: we're in

 15:04:32 <Riddell> skaet even

 15:04:35 <skaet> :)

 15:05:12 <roadmr> I don't think I have a flavor

 15:05:18 <skaet> sorry roadmr

 15:05:47 <skaet> popey,  will the compiz & gsettings changes be tested and land before monday?  (ie. in time for A3?)

 15:06:28 <popey> skaet, right now we're working on the migration tool for gconf->gsettings. I'd like to hope it could land today!

 15:06:49 <popey> but the tool isn't fully tested, as in, it's currently being written

 15:06:53 <popey> ..

 15:07:23 <skaet> popey,  so basically waiting on the testing to be written,  rather than the tool?

 15:07:51 <popey> a bit of both yes

 15:08:24 <skaet> popey,  understood.

 15:08:37 <skaet> ..

 15:08:58 * skaet wonders if anyone else has questions?  please "o/" if you do

 15:09:14 <skaet> brendand, on your top 3 list, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/990575 has a fix and needs testing,   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1016195 is also waiting for input from your team (incomplete),  who�s looking into it?

 15:09:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 990575 in linux (Ubuntu) "Entire desktop becomes unresponsive after suspend/resume" [High,Incomplete]

 15:09:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1016195 in linux (Ubuntu Precise) "[Dell Latitude E6220] Crashes or exits with signal 9 when under heavy load" [High,Incomplete]

 15:09:44 <roadmr> o/

 15:10:34 <skaet> go roadmr

 15:10:38 <balloons> o/

 15:10:40 <roadmr> skaet: I'm working on bug 1016195, need to test kernels as requested by jsalisbury, and file an upstream bug, hopefully will do that today

 15:10:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1016195 in linux (Ubuntu Precise) "[Dell Latitude E6220] Crashes or exits with signal 9 when under heavy load" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1016195

 15:11:05 <roadmr> (well, rather I'm running the tests, jsalisbury is the one actually working on it!)

 15:11:36 <skaet> thanks roadmr.  :)   as long as they're not stalled out was the concern.

 15:11:39 <roadmr> our cert engineer in Lexington has the system for bug 990575, I'll poke him and see if he can move that one forward

 15:11:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 990575 in linux (Ubuntu) "Entire desktop becomes unresponsive after suspend/resume" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/990575

 15:12:05 <roadmr> skaet: no, they're being looked at, they just happen to be a bit time-consuming (each test run for the E6220 takes at least 2 hours)

 15:12:08 <roadmr> ..

 15:12:21 <skaet> Thanks roadmr.

 15:12:22 <skaet> ..

 15:12:28 <skaet> go balloons

 15:13:23 <balloons> just a quick off the wall question for everyone -- has there been issues in general with the 3.5 kernel series being unstable and causing kernel panics?

 15:13:45 <popey> i haven't seen any

 15:13:59 <ogasawara> balloons: haven't heard of anything here, do you have any info on the panic?

 15:14:02 <balloons> I just randomly got pinged twice this week from folks who can't run quantal at all due to them.. I'm working on getting them to file bugs

 15:14:28 <ogasawara> balloons: ack, if you can get their info in a bug I'll have my team take a look

 15:14:42 <ogasawara> balloons: 3.5 is still feeling a little rough which is worrysome

 15:14:49 <balloons> ogasawara, thanks.. just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something

 15:15:06 <balloons> ogasawara, yes.. ok, I was wondering if anyone else was feeling that

 15:15:25 <balloons> ..

 15:15:29 <ogasawara> balloons: we are seeing some suspend resume issues with the latest upload, so we're looking into that

 15:15:34 <ogasawara> ..

 15:16:17 <skaet> jibel, arosales - have we had booting Quantal server images since 0717?   can�t tell from the QA report.  Alternate issues appear fixed, so a bit confused.   If not,  which bug is the problem tracked under?

 15:16:45 * Daviey hides.

 15:16:58 <arosales> skaet: I know ARM had some issues building

 15:17:03 <skaet> Daviey,  feel free to add knowledge ;)

 15:17:03 <jibel> skaet, it was the same problem for all d-i based images and it is fixed

 15:17:16 <arosales> Daviey:  were there sever images also having issues

 15:17:28 <arosales> cloud images are building

 15:18:21 <Daviey> No, they look good today

 15:18:33 <arosales> ah, ok thanks Daviey

 15:18:39 <arosales> ..

 15:18:44 <Daviey> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/job/precise-server-amd64_default/

 15:19:04 <Daviey> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/job/precise-server-i386_default/

 15:19:54 <jibel> the poblem was lvm only https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Quantal/view/All%20Quantal/job/quantal-server-i386_lvm/

 15:20:47 <Daviey> world looks good.

 15:21:03 <stgraber> ogasawara: lxc stress testing here (trying to reproduce an issue Laney found a while ago and that was also happenning to me) led to quite a few weird hangs: bug 1021471

 15:21:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021471 in linux (Ubuntu) "stuck on mutex_lock creating a new network namespace when starting a container" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021471

 15:21:20 <stgraber> ogasawara: not completely clear what's going on, but something's definitely wrong

 15:21:23 <stgraber> ..

 15:22:00 <ogasawara> stgraber: hrm, thanks.  will get smb or cooloney to try and take a look.

 15:22:16 <ogasawara> ..

 15:22:19 <skaet> arosales,  which specific MIR�s are you concerned about in the blocking item section of your report?

 15:22:23 <skaet> ..

 15:22:35 <arosales> juju has become less of a concern

 15:22:57 <arosales> but we still have some MAAs related ones

 15:23:08 <arosales> and openstack

 15:23:31 <arosales> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html Under MIR tracking are the ones we are looking at

 15:23:44 <skaet> thanks.

 15:24:01 <Daviey> But generally, http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg is a mess

 15:24:29 <Riddell> \o

 15:24:31 <Daviey> seb128: any news on webkit dropping recommends on gstreamer bad?

 15:24:59 <ScottK> IIRC the news was seb128 wasn't going to touch it.

 15:25:21 <Daviey> ScottK: O_o.. where did he state that?

 15:25:22 <seb128> Daviey, feel free to upload, I don't maintain webkit

 15:25:30 <Daviey> seb128: Who does?

 15:25:31 <seb128> Daviey, on #ubuntu-devel and #ubuntu-release

 15:25:35 <seb128> nobody that's the issue

 15:26:01 <seb128> I did take already too much time to update it this week because software-center and other stuff were broken due to incompatibilities between libsoup and webkit

 15:26:01 <Daviey> well if it's going to be a "no you" issue, i'll do it.. not sure what the issue is..

 15:26:16 <Daviey> Certainly seems more Desktop issue than anything else.. but whatever.

 15:26:17 <seb128> well, I can upload

 15:26:23 <seb128> I wanted to see if it was going to build on arm* first

 15:26:40 <seb128> to not waste another 1 day of buildd time to get armel back in sync

 15:26:52 <Daviey> ah, that makes more sense.

 15:27:19 <seb128> but you are like the 3rd person to ask since yesterday about the recommend

 15:27:29 <seb128> so maybe it's more important to drop those and we can build on armel later

 15:27:34 <seb128> I will do an upload

 15:27:45 <seb128> ..

 15:27:54 <Daviey> seb128: well.. Keeping c-m dirty is the servers teams job, and i won't have desktop encroaching :)

 15:28:02 <Daviey> ..

 15:28:05 <skaet> yeah,  Daviey,  components-mismatches definitely looks like it needs some love,   plusone team ping time.

 15:28:06 <seb128> ;-)

 15:28:50 <Daviey> skaet: i think it's mostly blocked on resourcing the MIR team. :(

 15:29:20 <Daviey> I have about another 5 MIR's next week. :(

 15:29:24 <Daviey> ..

 15:29:45 <skaet> Daviey,  ack.  and summer vacation.  :(      ok,  its noted.

 15:29:48 <skaet> ..

 15:30:40 <skaet> ogra_,  rather long list of 12.04.1 bugs in your report,  are the fixes all really going to land before 08/02?

 15:31:21 <ogra_> skaet, it is the list that was discussed in the foundations meeting, i doubt all of them will be fixed, no

 15:31:29 <ogra_> but its a list the team picks from

 15:31:56 <ogra_> (should have probably mentioned that in the header)

 15:32:09 <stgraber> I think I fixed around 5 of them since the meeting, xnox has a pretty long list of bugs that'll disappear from the list when we get the new mdadm and e2fsprogs

 15:32:44 <xnox> mdadm - review comments fixed & reuploaded: pending on slangasek for re-review;

 15:32:49 <ogra_> and some of them are already fix committed (i.e. flash-kernel issues)

 15:33:02 <stgraber> but I'm expecting quite a good chunk of the rest won't make it to the point release. Will start re-milestoning as I know more.

 15:33:10 <xnox> e2fsprogs - pending on me and infinity to do a line by line cod-review

 15:33:53 <skaet> ogra_,  can we prune the bug lists down to the most likely high/critical ones next week?

 15:34:04 <ogra_> yep, will do

 15:34:12 <skaet> thanks stgraber,  re-milestoning would be welcome.

 15:34:26 <skaet> thanks xnox.  :)

 15:34:33 <skaet> thanks ogra_ :)

 15:34:34 <skaet> ..

 15:34:39 <skaet> Riddell go

 15:34:51 * skaet missed his "o/" earlier

 15:34:53 <Riddell> qt 3 is removed in debian, do we want to follow

 15:35:05 <Riddell> it's a question of if we care about lsb

 15:35:25 <Riddell> I don't but maybe someone else here does

 15:36:48 <skaet> seb128,   ^ any thoughts?

 15:37:10 <seb128> we do care about lsb I think

 15:37:26 <seb128> I would like to check with slangasek or cjwatson

 15:37:35 <seb128> I don't really care about qt3 though

 15:37:38 <seb128> does lsb requires it?

 15:37:47 <seb128> ..

 15:37:52 <Riddell> it's part of lsb 4.0 yes

 15:37:57 <Riddell> but nobody uses it any more

 15:38:40 <Riddell> I'll ask on the mailing list if nobody here has an opinion

 15:38:41 <Riddell> ..

 15:39:06 <skaet> Thanks Riddell!

 15:39:41 <seb128> thanks

 15:40:12 * skaet doesn't see any more hands in the backscroll...

 15:40:18 <skaet> anyone else have questions this week?

 15:40:54 <roadmr> o/

 15:41:21 <mdeslaur> Riddell: does stuff like the proprietary citrix client use qt3?

 15:41:39 <Riddell> mdeslaur: that I don't know

 15:41:50 <mdeslaur> we might want to take a look before killing it

 15:42:00 <mdeslaur> ..

 15:42:03 <skaet> go roadmr

 15:42:26 <roadmr> super-quick question re: bug 1021293, is this possible to fix by uploading a new version of the offending package so that upgrading from a clean 12.04 will succeed? (other than guarding against that sort of problem as suggested by cjwatson)

 15:42:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021293 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu 12.04 install stalls when doing apt-get upgrade" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021293

 15:42:42 <roadmr> ..

 15:43:18 <stgraber> mdeslaur: citrix doesn't at least

 15:43:19 <stgraber> ..

 15:43:39 <mdeslaur> hah, openmotif :)

 15:43:41 <mdeslaur> ..

 15:44:10 <rsalveti> o/

 15:45:21 <skaet> ogra_, cjwatson, stgraber,  ^ any thoughts on roadmr's question?   or best handled in the bug?

 15:45:36 <stgraber> best handled in the bug. cjohnston replied an hour ago with some more details.

 15:45:39 <stgraber> ..

 15:45:43 <stgraber> cjwatson

 15:46:10 <skaet> ok

 15:46:23 <skaet> rsalveti, go

 15:47:18 <rsalveti> ogasawara: ogra_: do we know what will happen with the kernel used for omap4? TI is currently only focused on getting the 3.4 based on stable, and is not showing any plans on moving the work to a 3.5 based kernel

 15:47:46 <cjwatson> roadmr: You'll probably have a fix by the end of today, without trying to work around me.

 15:47:51 <ogra_> well, afaik paolo already worked on a 3.5 port

 15:47:57 <ogra_> rsalveti, ^^^

 15:48:11 <ogra_> cherrypicking the missing bits into a mainline 3.5

 15:48:23 <rsalveti> ogra_: oh, ok, so then he'll be mainly maintaining the tree himself I suppose

 15:48:28 <roadmr> cjwatson: awesome, thanks!

 15:48:57 <cjwatson> roadmr: I'll talk with Robert Ancell at some point, but, while accountsservice is broken, I don't think we should rely on whack-a-mole fixes in packages being upgraded to fix this general problem.

 15:48:59 <ogra_> rsalveti, but i dont know the status, he vanished with the rest of the kernel team from IRC when their sprint started, probably ogasawara can give details

 15:49:55 <ogra_> i know he had something that booted already though ...

 15:49:56 <ogra_> ..

 15:50:09 <rsalveti> ogra_: ok, I can follow this up with the kernel team then, just want to make sure we're at least working on the same thing, if possible

 15:50:20 <ogasawara> rsalvet, ogra_:  well, the current omap4 kernel is v3.4 based.  ppisati has been playing with a v3.5 port though.  I'll throw it on the agenda for the morning to discuss further.

 15:50:22 <ogasawara> ..

 15:50:23 <rsalveti> as if he decides to push a 3.5 based on, we'd need to make sure it's well tested

 15:50:29 <ogra_> rsalveti, well, he cherry picked from TILT i think

 15:50:42 <ogra_> ..

 15:50:42 <brendand> cjwatson - it still needs to be fixed in ubiquity for sure, we're just wondering will the 12.04 release image work for us again

 15:50:49 <rsalveti> ogasawara: ok, thanks

 15:50:56 <rsalveti> ogra_: yeah, ok :-)

 15:50:56 <cjwatson> brendand: Ah, yes, we do need to fix both

 15:50:58 <rsalveti> ..

 15:51:20 <cjwatson> brendand: Any of my three suggestions in the bug would cover that

 15:51:38 <cjwatson> brendand: But I don't routinely work on accountsservice myself so I'd prefer robert_ancell's input there

 15:51:59 <cjwatson> Anyway, we should do this in the bug

 15:52:30 <brendand> cjwatson, sure. i have already posted the same question in the bug

 15:52:43 <skaet> am not seeing any further questions for this meeting...

 15:52:50 <ogra_> o/

 15:52:58 <skaet> go ogra_  :)

 15:53:06 <ogra_> rsalveti, whats the status on PVR, any solution in sight ?

 15:53:25 <ogra_> (and also can you make it work with a possible 3.5 kernel easily)

 15:53:36 <ogra_> ..

 15:54:23 <rsalveti> ogra_: I'll be working on getting it available at quantal over the next few days, but one thing that kind of worried be at the first moment is that this driver is not behaving properly with compiz/unity

 15:54:38 <ogra_> yeah, i read that

 15:54:47 <rsalveti> so I'm checking the bugs on the linaro side, and also trying to find if someone would be able to help

 15:54:48 <ogra_> did you use the new upstream compiz ?

 15:54:50 <rsalveti> probably robclark

 15:54:59 <rsalveti> both the old and the new that is currently on development

 15:55:14 <ogra_> great, if rob is involved i'm confident that we'll have a happy end :)

 15:55:21 <rsalveti> but, as long as we don't deploy compiz right away with gles support, it'd still be useful to have a newer driver available

 15:55:22 <ogra_> ..

 15:55:28 <rsalveti> ogra_: exactly ;-)

 15:55:29 <rsalveti> ..

 15:56:18 <skaet> time to end now then.  :)

 15:56:24 <skaet> #endmeeting
