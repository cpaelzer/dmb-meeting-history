 00:04:56 <meetingology> Meeting started Fri Feb 17 00:04:56 2012 UTC.  The chair is cyphermox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 00:05:12 <cyphermox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for February 16, 2012. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:05:21 <cyphermox> yay, my date thing worked.

 00:05:25 <pleia2> :D

 00:05:32 <cyphermox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 00:05:43 <cyphermox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:05:53 <cyphermox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:06:03 <cyphermox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:06:12 <cyphermox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:06:23 <cyphermox> #voters cyphermox Pendulum pleia2 beuno n0rman greg-g dinda nhandler

 00:06:23 <meetingology> Warning: Nick not in channel: dinda

 00:06:23 <meetingology> Current voters: Pendulum beuno cyphermox dinda greg-g n0rman nhandler pleia2

 00:06:37 <cyphermox> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:06:48 <cyphermox> is kdub here?

 00:06:56 <cyphermox> apparently not, my completion failed

 00:07:32 <cyphermox> what about caravena ?

 00:08:01 <cyphermox> continuing throught the list...

 00:08:16 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for Chris Wayne (cwayne)

 00:08:24 <cwayne> hi!

 00:08:33 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChrisWayne

 00:08:38 <cwayne> Okay everyone, my name is Chris Wayne (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChrisWayne)

 00:09:16 <cwayne> While I do quite a bit of work for Ubuntu within Canonical (QA'ing platforms that have gone on to ship in the millions around the world) I also contribute to the overall community on my own time

 00:09:44 <pleia2> that's great to see :)

 00:09:51 <cwayne> I frequent askubuntu answering questions that I'm able, as well as on reddit answering peoples questions, not only technical, but also questions about ubuntu in general

 00:10:05 <cwayne> such as (whats coming in the next unity, how is 12.04 alpha looking?, etc)

 00:10:24 <lifeless> I'm sorry about my adsl.

 00:10:34 <cwayne> i also always use the latest dev release and log bugs, have been logging bugs on unity since maverick

 00:11:02 <pleia2> nice

 00:11:06 <cwayne> and lastly, i act as sort of an unofficial liason to other communities, such as helping and advocating ubuntu to many in #webos (and am even working on an Ubuntu One webos app on my own time :))

 00:11:29 <cwayne> as well as convincing all my friends/acquantinces/family to switch to ubuntu (in fact many of them have :) )

 00:12:08 <lifeless> and back, sorry, adsl faaaaail

 00:12:20 <lifeless> telecom seem to hate my house midday at the moment

 00:12:29 <cwayne> well i guess that's enough about me, unless there's any questions

 00:12:38 <pleia2> thanks for having such a thorough wiki page

 00:12:40 <lifeless> last I saw was 13:06 < meetingology> Current voters: Pendulum beuno cyphermox dinda greg-g n0rman nhandler pleia2

 00:12:58 <cyphermox> lifeless: just a second

 00:13:16 <lifeless> catching up via irclogs.u.c

 00:13:43 <lifeless> which is out of date ><

 00:13:50 <cyphermox> http://paste.ubuntu.com/845187/

 00:13:52 <pleia2> lifeless: yeah, it only updates on the hour

 00:14:32 <pleia2> cwayne: how do you feel about the current software developer to software center workflow? does it work positively for developers?

 00:14:59 <cwayne> pleia2: honestly, i feel it could be more efficient

 00:15:35 * pleia2 nods

 00:15:40 <cwayne> pleia2: i submitted an app (just a stupid pidgin emoticons theme type deal) and felt there was quite a delay before I heard anything (including whether or not the submission went through correctly)

 00:15:57 <pleia2> good to know

 00:15:59 <cwayne> pleia2: actually that reminds me, I've also reached out to developers (specifically of lenses) and tried to help them get their apps in the software center :)

 00:16:11 <cyphermox> ah, I'll let somebody know about this :)

 00:16:34 <pleia2> cwayne: yeah, I snagged that question via your wiki page, it's good to see people out there doing that

 00:16:45 <cyphermox> stgraber: if this is still up your alley ^^

 00:17:02 * cwayne forgot that was on my page

 00:23:42 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for Daniel Manrique (roadmr)

 00:23:47 <cwayne> thanks roadmr lifeless and Pendulum :)

 00:23:47 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanielManrique

 00:24:07 <roadmr> Hello!

 00:24:18 <roadmr> I'm Daniel, a.k.a. roadmr (short for Roadmaster). My wiki page http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanielManrique

 00:24:33 <roadmr> I'm a long-time Linux user, I started using (and got involved with) Ubuntu a few years ago. I've been working for Canonical for a bit over a year, so I get to tinker with Ubuntu on a daily basis.

 00:24:55 <roadmr> I try to help the project and community in various ways, such as answering questions, triaging and fixing bugs, translating, and anything I may be of assistance with. I'm also very involved with the Ubuntu Friendly community testing program and the related checkbox System Testing utility.

 00:25:34 <pleia2> how is Ubuntu Friendly going?

 00:26:02 <roadmr> pleia2: We see the most submissions right after release time, it's an asymptotic decrease

 00:26:30 <roadmr> pleia2: we are looking into ways of making testing more interesting/fun, which we hope will make more test submissions come in over time

 00:26:37 * pleia2 nods

 00:26:42 <roadmr> Back in the early days I was heavily into Linux evangelism; I scaled back over the years, but recently I started getting a bit more involved, which has been great, as I like to help a "new generation" of Ubuntu and Linux users get the most out of free software.

 00:26:48 <pleia2> it's a great project, I'm really glad we have it now

 00:27:04 <roadmr> So that's me! I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.

 00:27:23 <roadmr> pleia2: yes! there's still room for improvement, do expect some new things coming in 12.04 ;)

 00:27:34 <pleia2> thanks for such a thorough wiki page

 00:40:17 <cyphermox> #subtopic Membership application for Paul Belanger (pabelanger)

 00:40:20 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulBelanger

 00:40:26 <pabelanger> ohai!

 00:40:29 <cyphermox> hey!

 00:40:42 <cyphermox> a fellow canadian

 00:40:48 <pabelanger> My name is Paul Belanger, as the link says.  My wiki page is located at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulBelanger

 00:40:54 <pabelanger> No doubt about it

 00:42:08 <pleia2> so, how good are you at debugging digium card problems? ;)

 00:42:24 <pabelanger> I'm currently an open source developer for the Asterisk project.  My goal is to help maintain the asterisk packages within ubuntu.  I help out triaging issue and providing patches when I can.  Additionally I've been helping with 12.04 recently with nagios, dahdi, puppet and nsca

 00:42:50 <pabelanger> pleia2: good, my back ground is telecommunications.  So looking at a debug log for that is not an issue

 00:43:26 <pleia2> I don't actually know the status if asterisk in Ubuntu (I do use it in Debian)

 00:43:48 <pabelanger> As from that, my next tasks are automation with puppet and openstack

 00:44:12 <pabelanger> pleia2: I actually help tzafrir on the pkg-voip team

 00:45:04 <pabelanger> Plus the obligatory helping people to start using Ubuntu for Desktop and Server environments

 00:46:01 <pabelanger> I'm happy to answer any questions too

 00:46:39 <pleia2> pabelanger: there don't happen to be any folks you've worked with in the Ubuntu community here, are there?

 00:46:49 <pleia2> it would be nice to see some testimonials from them

 00:47:20 <pabelanger> Mostly people in ubuntu-motu that helped me upload the packages

 00:47:27 <pabelanger> sponsorship

 00:48:33 <pabelanger> Guess I should have linked http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2012/02/16/ubuntu-12-04-development-update-14/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubuntu-12-04-development-update-14 to my wiki too, but only found that a few hours aog

 00:48:35 <pabelanger> ago*

 00:49:00 <pabelanger> Under the 'First timers!' section

 00:49:23 <pleia2> cool

 00:49:40 <cyphermox> oh, nice!

 00:52:36 <pleia2> pabelanger: you clearly do a lot of really great work with open source (I use asterisk and nagios, so it's appreciated!) but I'd really like to see you move forward with involved with the Ubuntu-VoIP team and get some testimonials from developers you're working with in the Ubuntu community

 00:54:01 <pabelanger> I'm not sure who else to get involved with, since I appear to be the only person that will triage the issues for asterisk / dahdi.

 00:54:32 <broder> have you run into superm1 at all? i know he has a lot of blog posts about asterisk configuration; don't know whether he does any packaging maintenance

 00:54:33 <pabelanger> Like you mentioned, the Ubuntu-voip teams seems to be small / no active.  So, I'm just trying to help get it started

 00:55:03 <cyphermox> I'd have to agree to that, your involvement seems very development centric / related to bug triaage and such; so I'd possibly suggest working some more on that aspect, do a few more uploads and apply for Per-package upload rights before the Developer Membership Board.

 00:55:27 <pleia2> (Developer Membership Board gets you Ubuntu Membership too)

 00:55:27 <cyphermox> pabelanger: it doesn't have to be the Ubuntu-VoIP team, anyone can probably sponsor packages for you

 00:55:43 <pabelanger> broder: sadly no.  Most of my currently business is providing asterisk solutions on Ubuntu so I would be interested in seeing his work

 00:55:52 <cyphermox> so if you want to revive the ubuntu-voip team that's also great (we need good telephony)

 00:56:31 <pabelanger> So, I should be applying to the Developer Membership Board first, before this board?

 00:56:50 <pleia2> if you apply to the dev membership board you don't need to apply here

 00:57:11 <pleia2> I'd suggest going that route, since we don't really have the capacity to properly judge your packaging contributions

 00:57:20 <cyphermox> right. but they look for different things, but it seems like you've already well started involvement with teh Debian team, and some other uploads

 00:58:25 <pabelanger> I see, figured getting Ubuntu Membership first before applying to Developer Membership Board would be the preferred route

 00:58:57 <cyphermox> pabelanger: right

 00:59:20 <pleia2> yeah, no need to do that, dev membership includes ubuntu membership so with that you're all good

 00:59:40 <cyphermox> pabelanger: since we're in the same timezone feel free to ping me when you want if you have things to sponsor, I'll see how I can help (though that's normally not the kind of packages I focus on)

 01:00:19 <pabelanger> Okay then, feel free to -1 me and I'll do the Development Membership route

 01:00:21 <pabelanger> cyphermox: will do

 01:00:51 <cyphermox> OTOH, if you're interested in doing differently focused work in the community, I don't think there are still Ubuntu Hours in Ottawa, and we in Ubuntu-QC have been itching for a reason to visit for a while :)

 01:01:34 * pabelanger nods

 01:01:40 <cyphermox> pabelanger: in this particular case we don't need to vote

 01:01:58 <pabelanger> I'm trying to review the asterisk user group, and start a openstack one too.  I'm sure we'll cross paths

 01:02:09 <cyphermox> there are no other applicants and we're out of time so I think we'll end this meeting now

 01:02:18 <pangolin> I +1 cyphermox' idea about visiting a ottawa UH

 01:02:20 <cyphermox> pabelanger: awesome.

 01:02:37 <cyphermox> pangolin: yeah, you'll clearly be coming with us to visit in the summer :)
