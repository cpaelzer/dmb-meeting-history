 21:01:53 <pitti> (I migth as well)

 21:02:11 <pitti> kees: 2100 London time, wasn't that the latest agreement?

 21:02:27 <pitti> #topic action review

 21:02:27 <kees> 2100 _london_, not 2100 utc?

 21:02:44 <pitti> kees: yes, otherwise we'd keep changing the actual time for all of us

 21:03:05 <solarcloud_3scrn> What is the meeting about ?

 21:03:09 <kees> london dst!=us dst, but it's fine. I'm cool

 21:03:21 <pitti> the only pending action that we have is the brainstorm reviwe

 21:03:38 <pitti> admittedly with the london sprint and its preparation I haven't gotten to this yet, but I'm planning for this tomorrow

 21:03:42 <cjwatson> kees: it's wrong for like a week or two a year :)

 21:04:09 <pitti> #topic add cinder and quantum packages to existing OpenStack MRE

 21:04:15 <pitti> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2012-December/001440.html

 21:04:15 <cjwatson> it takes us three meetings to argue about tz changes anyway

 21:04:23 <pitti> kees already ack'ed this one, so that's done

 21:04:31 <stgraber> kees: it's better to have one week where we may be out of sync than spending two months trying to figure out what our meeting time is :)

 21:04:42 <stgraber> bah, what cjwatson said ;)

 21:04:45 <pitti> I don't see anythign else on the ML, did I miss anything?

 21:05:03 <cjwatson> cinder and quantum seem like shoe-ins to me

 21:05:08 <pitti> solarcloud_3scrn: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda

 21:05:20 <pitti> solarcloud_3scrn: (not much of an agenda today, though)

 21:05:25 <solarcloud_3scrn> ok I'll opt out, bye.

 21:05:46 <pitti> #topic AOB

 21:05:50 <pitti> anyone?

 21:06:06 <solarcloud_3scrn> before I go Ubuntu TV is finally off the shelf ... http://goo.gl/W42gI

 21:06:30 <stgraber> lookss like one of those short meetings ;) (nothing here)

 21:06:38 <stgraber> *looks

 21:06:56 <cjwatson> other than still bouncing slightly about secure boot working on 12.04 at last, I have no other business

 21:07:33 <pitti> I guess we'll skip the next meeting on 12/24, and see each other in the next year/

 21:07:35 <pitti> ?

 21:08:18 <cjwatson> I certainly won't be around at 9pm on Christmas Eve

 21:08:30 <stgraber> yeah, I doubt we'll get much to talk about by the 24th anyway and if there's something urgent, we have a mailing-list ;)

 21:08:35 <stgraber> (and I won't be around anyway ;))

 21:08:43 <pitti> *nod*

 21:08:55 <pitti> so, c'est Ã§a

 21:08:59 <pitti> thanks and have a nice evening everyone!
