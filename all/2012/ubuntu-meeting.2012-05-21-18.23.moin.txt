 18:23:27 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:23:30 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:23:47 <jdstrand> I am on triage this week

 18:24:12 <jdstrand> mdeslaur and I will be finishing the work items review this week

 18:24:31 <jdstrand> I will be publishing a libxml2 update today or tomorrow

 18:24:46 <jdstrand> I have several pending updates I am working on

 18:24:51 <jdstrand> and then an embargoed issue

 18:25:41 <jdstrand> I'm hitting small work items here and there, and have started ufw python3 port (over the weekend, but may poke at it some this week)

 18:26:05 <jdstrand> mdeslaur is off today. I know he is working on pending updates. he is in the happy place

 18:26:08 <jdstrand> sbeattie: you're up

 18:26:16 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week

 18:26:28 <sbeattie> I've also got a few updates in progress.

 18:27:13 <sbeattie> I'm also planning on apparmor work this week.

 18:27:21 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me.

 18:27:28 <sbeattie> micahg: you're next

 18:28:31 <jdstrand> sbeattie: are those apparmor work items, the SRU or some combination?

 18:29:26 <sbeattie> jdstrand: SRU + work items, yes.

 18:29:31 <micahg> I've got patch piloting today, webkit update for precise this week, apparmor profile fixes for Firefox/Thunderbird (SRU for lucid-precise), will do earlier in the week so as not to block sbeattie, and chromium's build is broke ATM, so I need to dig into that as there's a pending update

 18:29:34 <jdstrand> awesome, thanks :)

 18:30:36 <micahg> I guess that's it for me

 18:30:56 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 18:31:03 <tyhicks> It is a short week for me since I'm off Friday

 18:31:38 <tyhicks> I took on a sudo update and a sudo feature backport last week, so I've still got my eCryptfs work that I planned on doing last week

 18:32:30 <tyhicks> I imagine that getting caught up on eCryptfs bug fixes and the kernel merge window will soak up most of my week. I've got a few bug fixes that have patches written, I just haven't had a chance to test and push them upstream.

 18:32:53 <tyhicks> If I do get through all of that early, I've got a pidgin update that is pending in the testing stage.

 18:33:02 <tyhicks> (I see a reoccuring theme here :)

 18:33:11 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 18:33:17 <tyhicks> jjohansen: You're up

 18:33:20 * jjohansen needs to work with sbeattie on releasing apparmor 2.8 this week, there are a couple of minor patches to finish up/test finish. /me also needs to finish going through work items and sticking time estimates on them. After that its back to resurrecting prototypes, dbus, cgroups, env filtering

 18:34:17 <jjohansen> I think that is about it jdstrand back to you?

 18:34:21 <jdstrand> jjohansen: how did the quantal kernel fixes go?

 18:35:08 <jjohansen> jdstrand: oh those look good, thanks for the kick I forgot to push them on the weekend

 18:35:16 * jjohansen will do that first

 18:35:44 * jjohansen got side tracked bug hunting

 18:35:48 <jdstrand> cool

 18:35:59 * jdstrand wasn't trying to kick, just curious :)

 18:36:08 <jjohansen> nah, is good

 18:36:29 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:36:35 <jdstrand> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/libspring-java.html

 18:36:40 <jdstrand> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/python-tornado.html

 18:36:43 <jdstrand> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/drupal6-mod-views.html

 18:36:46 <jdstrand> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/dimp1.html

 18:36:50 <jdstrand> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/pyfribidi.html

 18:37:03 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 18:37:08 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 18:37:17 <jdstrand> did that slightly out of order...

 18:37:22 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 18:37:32 <jdstrand> There are a lot of merge opportunities for packages listed in http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/. Performing these updates is a great way to help Ubuntu and bolster your developer application.

 18:37:52 <jdstrand> I also had two other things

 18:38:42 <jdstrand> 1. jjohansen has too many work items. once he gives time estimates mdeslaur and I will look at them and then probably discuss as a team how to proceed (eg, Roadmap 'low' ones or reassign some)

 18:38:59 <jdstrand> (mdeslaur will lead that effort)

 18:39:32 <jdstrand> 2. the desktop team approached me about testing mozilla releases before upstream release day

 18:39:38 <jdstrand> (fyi micahg ^)

 18:39:55 <jdstrand> I said that this is the plan and that we have work items in place to achieve this

 18:40:07 <micahg> they do realize this is one day, right?

 18:40:22 <jdstrand> micahg: no, test the images for they tag them

 18:40:32 <jdstrand> like we said, we build them automatically

 18:40:34 <micahg> jdstrand: huh?

 18:40:37 <jdstrand> when it gets close, we test

 18:40:53 <jdstrand> s/for they/before they/

 18:41:00 <micahg> yes, I mean there is only 1 work day to do this still (builds are tagged on Friday), yes, it's possible

 18:41:02 <jdstrand> eg, the release every 6 weeks

 18:41:10 <jdstrand> at 5 weeks, we can have testable packages

 18:41:15 <micahg> no, we can't

 18:41:20 <jdstrand> why?

 18:41:27 <micahg> they push out fixes in the final week

 18:41:39 * jdstrand nods

 18:41:45 <micahg> the beta PPA is for people to test

 18:42:12 <jdstrand> the beta ppa is on 15 or something now, no?

 18:42:16 <micahg> ideally, people are running the beta and reporting issues along the way so my final testing is basically a rubber stamp

 18:42:23 <mdeslaur> test = look at 20 screenshots

 18:42:26 <micahg> if I catch anything in my testing, it's too late anyways

 18:43:06 <micahg> yeah, once we have the automated testing screenshots, I think I'll run that against the beta PPA weekly, that should improve things

 18:43:15 <micahg> s/improve/catch things earlier/

 18:43:24 <jdstrand> I would still argue that testing twice, once a week before and one day of would still be better than testing a day or two after

 18:43:35 <jdstrand> even if it is not automated yet

 18:43:48 <jdstrand> but anyway

 18:43:55 <micahg> sure, I can QA the beta the week before

 18:44:30 <jdstrand> in this particular instance, that asked if we could test early (ie, twice) to catch anything for the point release

 18:44:48 <jdstrand> micahg: can you coordinate that with the desktop team-- ie the exact timing)

 18:44:53 <micahg> the point release is in 3 months, we'll have 2 more releases before that

 18:45:17 <jdstrand> micahg: you might also mention the beta ppa-- I mentioned it, but they ones I saw were way past '13'-- they were on 15

 18:45:34 <micahg> 12.04.1 will get FIrefox 14

 18:45:51 <sbeattie> jdstrand: is there ay possibility of getting QA resources to assist?

 18:45:58 <jdstrand> micahg: yes, I know-- but they asked for this to happen in a couple of weeks. can you coordinate/clarify what they need?

 18:46:06 * jdstrand is trying not to be the middle-man

 18:46:08 <micahg> jdstrand: sure, who's the contact for that?

 18:46:30 <jdstrand> seb128 asked me-- I imagine either him or chris

 18:46:46 <micahg> sbeattie: I asked QA a while back to start running QRT, maybe I can get them to review the results more frequently once we have the screenshotting capability

 18:47:09 <jdstrand> sbeattie: well, now that we are on rapid release, we don't have the big call for testing-- everything is just a 'regular' update

 18:47:26 <micahg> jdstrand: I think he meant help with testing :)

 18:47:37 <jdstrand> and all they are asking for is us to do our regular testing by some point

 18:47:42 <sbeattie> jdstrand: what micahg said, not just calls for testing.

 18:47:53 <jdstrand> (see last statement)

 18:48:30 <jdstrand> and since that regular testing is something we should be doing anyway, I said 'ok'

 18:49:21 <jdstrand> anyhoo, this is a little more complicated than it has to be. desktop team needs tests to happen be a certain date. if micahg can ascertain the date and do the testing, that would be great. everything else is executing our work items

 18:52:29 <jdstrand> I think that is it

 18:52:37 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?
