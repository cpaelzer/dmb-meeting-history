 15:08:14 <ev> at a webops sprint all week

 15:08:23 <ev> been charming the errors.ubuntu.com infrastructure

 15:08:31 <ev> and unbreaking the retracers (damn you dpkg -x)

 15:08:48 <ev> also working on moving daisy.ubuntu.com to backing to S3

 15:08:50 <ev> instead of NFS

 15:09:04 <ev> at the request of IS

 15:09:06 <ev> (done)

 15:09:16 <slangasek> cjohnston:

 15:09:18 <slangasek> er

 15:09:18 <slangasek> cjwatson:

 15:09:26 <cjwatson> Fixed various cdimage publishing bugs exposed by beta-2.

 15:09:26 <cjwatson> Lots of rls-q-tracking bug work, too many to list, including finally adding /etc/default/grub.d/, various i18n/l10n bugs, etc.  Still trying to sort out d-i lowmem issues.

 15:09:30 <cjwatson> Sponsoring various arm64 config.guess/sub fixes from Wookey.  More to come.

 15:09:32 <slangasek> cjohnston: have you considered a stage name

 15:09:33 <cjwatson> Progressive rebuild of remaining packages in armel/main for ARMv5t.

 15:09:35 <cjwatson> +1 maintenance this month.  Mostly working on build fixes.  eclipse-* was a particularly exciting cluster to unstick.

 15:09:38 <cjwatson> .

 15:10:18 <ScottK> unstick is a nice euphemism.

 15:10:18 <cjwatson> barry: I happened to notice that at least some twisted.trial py3 support was upstream now

 15:10:31 <infinity> * Done this week:

 15:10:31 <infinity> - Beta 2 released

 15:10:31 <infinity> - Kernel SRU wrangling

 15:10:31 <infinity> - Other SRU and AA tasks

 15:10:31 <infinity> - gtkhtml4.0 transition, linux-armadaxp license review, dpkg bugfix, vmware-view and sbsigntool version bumps, etc

 15:10:34 <infinity> - working on a new eglibc SRU to replace the one superseded by the last security update

 15:10:37 <infinity> - (Re-)enable bootstrap archives for Colin's unbreaking of various bits

 15:10:40 <infinity> ‚ò≠

 15:10:42 <barry> cjwatson: yep, they mentioned that was a blocker for continued work

 15:10:48 <ogra_> russian !

 15:10:48 <slangasek> ev: S3> if this is done, does this mean they no longer care how much space it takes p? :)

 15:10:51 <slangasek> up

 15:11:05 <ev> slangasek: hahaha

 15:11:08 <ev> this is for the core files

 15:11:13 <ev> which at the moment get deleted

 15:11:24 <ev> though I suspect it'll make the argument for keeping them around easier

 15:11:55 <slangasek> :)

 15:12:01 <xnox> slangasek: there is a setting to tab-complete nicknames based on frequency instead of pure alphabetical order.

 15:12:12 <cjwatson> Oh, I forgot: currently working on some build log analysis for hardening flag regressions.  Not sure how far I'll have time to get.

 15:12:25 <slangasek> ev: so if that goes smoothly, we may want to talk about whether to do the same for ddebs.u.c

 15:13:08 <xnox> slangasek: well since servercloud has nice swift mirrors backed by S3 already, it should be doable for a "normal" apt-getable archive.

 15:13:30 <slangasek> xnox: your turn :)

 15:13:33 <xnox> - sponsor fix for bug 1056350

 15:23:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1058179 in ubuntu-defaults-zh-cn (Ubuntu Quantal) "Incomplete language install (language-pack-zh-hans: 1:12.10+20120920)" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1058179

 15:23:18 <ogra_> slangasek, it said 3-5 workdays

 15:23:25 <slangasek> phooey, that's a long time

 15:23:34 <xnox> stokachu: make sure ubuntu-sponsors are subscribed, those three 977959,683640,1053306 don't and hence are not in the http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/sponsoring/ and hence fell out of my radar of "easy sponsorship tasks" I try to do in evenings =)

 15:23:35 <ogra_> slangasek, though its not clear yet that i ordered the right thing :P

 15:23:52 <ogra_> seemingly there is some confusion ... i might end up with both :)

 15:23:53 <slangasek> you didn't request the SCHNELL SCHNELL shipping option?

 15:24:00 <ogra_> lol

 15:24:04 <ev> slangasek: random stats: we're currently using 1.2 TB with 2.2 TB free. We're effectively doubling that (going from three nodes in Cassandra to six).

 15:24:05 <stgraber> cjwatson: I'll see how fixable it's, but I'm expecting a similar mess as 12.04.1 where the image gets really big really quickly

 15:24:11 <ogra_> no offer for that

 15:24:22 <stokachu> xnox: ? ive been assigning ubuntu-sru

 15:24:30 <slangasek> ev: that's apropos the crash pruning?

 15:24:31 <stokachu> they are notified of all changes is that not correct?

 15:24:36 <stgraber> cjwatson: I assigned it to me now so I don't forget

 15:24:53 <infinity> stokachu: ubuntu-sru doesn't sponsor things, just review/accept uploads.

 15:25:03 <infinity> stokachu: (Well, we *can* sponsor things, but that's not the point of the group)

 15:25:08 <stokachu> ah

 15:25:09 <ev> slangasek: that's the amount of space in use on each node

 15:25:13 <ev> (we have replication set to 3)

 15:25:16 <stokachu> lol so what group should I be adding?

 15:25:19 <stokachu> just ubuntu-sponsors?

 15:25:25 <ev> we don't save the core files right now

 15:25:29 <ev> once they're retraced, they're deleted

 15:25:30 <cjwatson> stgraber: I was hoping that size would be less of an issue now

 15:25:41 <slangasek> ev: ok - so how fast are we burning through the space at this point? :) Does it grow linearly?

 15:25:48 <cjwatson> stgraber: But we should certainly establish that the things QA is testing for agree with what the owners of this image think they want to offer :-)

 15:26:10 <cjwatson> stokachu: Just ubuntu-sponsors, yes

 15:26:25 <stokachu> ahhh no wonder

 15:26:26 <infinity> stokachu: ubuntu-sponsors, if you need a sponsor, ubuntu-sru as well, if it's an SRU bug, though the latter often happens automagically when we run tools to accept things from the queue anyway.

 15:26:35 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:26:49 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 15:26:53 <cjwatson> stokachu: Right, it doesn't hurt to subscribe ubuntu-sru as well but it basically doesn't help

 15:26:53 <xnox> stokachu: you need both for SRU: debdiff -> unapproved queue -> accepted in -proposed. Sponsors for the first hop, SRU team for the second hop.

 15:26:54 <stokachu> ah ok awesome, makes sense now

 15:26:58 <ev> slangasek: doubling every six months

 15:26:59 <stgraber> cjwatson: well, IIRC if we actually include everything, we're talking about almost 100MB (all chinese langpacks + dictionaries + ibus tables + the same for english)

 15:27:16 <stokachu> excellent, makes sense now thanks

 15:27:25 <slangasek> ev: ew?

 15:27:26 <stokachu> ill get them assigned to the sponsors queue

 15:27:41 <bdmurray> subscribed not assigned

 15:27:46 <stgraber> cjwatson: anyway, I'll take a look after the meeting, will fix the package and see how big the difference will be

 15:27:56 <slangasek> I thought I was being conservative with the suggestion of linear growth :P

 15:28:01 <xnox> stokachu: can't we afford that in chinese-quantal image at the expense of non-chinese langpacks?

 15:28:18 <cjwatson> You mean stgraber not stokachu

 15:28:27 <xnox> yes.

 15:28:41 <slangasek> so our targeted bug count is certainly looking better this week

 15:28:47 <cjwatson> And I don't think langpacks come close to offsetting additional language *support*

 15:28:49 <slangasek> but as cjwatson pointed out, it's still high

 15:28:54 <xnox> stgraber: can't we afford that in chinese-quantal image at the expense of non-chinese langpacks?

 15:29:01 <slangasek> looks like we're down from ~60 to 41

 15:29:09 <cjwatson> 20 priority High

 15:29:29 <cjwatson> Anyone know what's happening with these apt gpg bugs?

 15:29:34 <stgraber> xnox: there's no easy way to remove langpacks as the image is built with ubuntu-defaults-builder, not our usual tools and ultimately the problem is that we can't remove the english langpack as various bits depend on en_US.UTF-8 being around (instead of just using C.UTF-8)

 15:29:47 <slangasek> cjwatson: I've seen activity on them from mvo

 15:30:00 <cjwatson> Can we assign him to them?

 15:30:09 * xnox wants to target some bugs to r-series, and if fixed in r, sru into quantal.

 15:30:13 <xnox> (the acient onces)

 15:30:37 <stokachu> xnox: how often does this report get generated

 15:30:40 <ev> slangasek: :) iz webops problem

 15:30:42 <infinity> slangasek: The eglibc one's being done today.

 15:30:50 <xnox> cjwatson: about apt-gpg bugs, it wasn't clear to me if it's all fix-released or partitially solved. since there were security uploads done.

 15:31:09 <bdmurray> stokachu: the rls-q-tracking one is hourly

 15:31:10 <slangasek> cjwatson: bug #1016643 has had SRUs for software-properties in friends; maybe the apt task is no longer relevant?

 15:31:11 <cjwatson> xnox: If you're planning on SRUing things into quantal post-release, please set the milestone to quantal-updates so that that's immediately clear from the report

 15:31:11 <xnox> stokachu: Last updated at: Wed, 03 Oct 2012 15:09:36 -0000. My guess is every hour?

 15:31:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1016643 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "add-apt-repository downloads gpg key in an insecure fashion" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1016643

 15:31:19 <cjwatson> slangasek: Indeed, I don't know

 15:31:24 <stokachu> ok cool thanks

 15:31:31 <cjwatson> And bug 1013681 has been stagnant for a while

 15:31:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1013681 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "make apt-key net-update secure" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1013681

 15:31:37 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm, why did we agree to be responsible for fontconfig? :)

 15:31:53 <xnox> slangasek: I heard Laney likes fontconfig a lot =)

 15:32:06 <slangasek> cjwatson: so 1013681 doesn't seem tied to the release, I'm going to -notfixing it

 15:32:14 <bdmurray> slangasek: having it appear in the spreadsheet doesn't mean agree ;-)

 15:32:23 <infinity> slangasek: but #1008777 may or may not be a bug/misfeature, but it almost certainly doesn't need to be targetted and tracked as special.

 15:32:24 <cjwatson> slangasek: sounds good to me

 15:33:16 <cjwatson> I would love the report to notice that bug 1053770 is assigned to James Page and maybe that ought to override its own idea of which team it belongs to

 15:33:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1053770 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu Quantal) "ubuntu-server install takes up too much space" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1053770

 15:33:46 <slangasek> bdmurray: can you bump that over to desktop in the spreadsheet?

 15:33:59 <bdmurray> slangasek: sure

 15:34:07 <bdmurray> cjwatson: noted regarding the report

 15:34:33 <cjwatson> Of course, you win some you lose some, since we'd gain at least one bug from elsewhere that way

 15:34:40 <slangasek> infinity: 1008777> undecided+incomplete, that's not really one we're worrying about as-is (it was clearly targeted by the community, not through the rls-q-incoming queue)

 15:35:29 <bdmurray> slangasek: it was targetted by vanhoof

 15:35:44 <cjwatson> Yeah, I'm basically ignoring stuff from Medium on down for the purposes of worrying about the count

 15:36:08 <slangasek> bug #1026778 filled me with maintainer-script-induced rage; I think we should untarget it

 15:36:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1026778 in dictionaries-common (Ubuntu Quantal) "Package does not upgrade cleanly from precise" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1026778

 15:36:13 <cjwatson> So as far as I'm concerned the current report says we have 20 RC bugs

 15:36:22 <slangasek> bdmurray: right, but I don't think he was meaning to ask us to fix it

 15:36:59 <cjwatson> slangasek: Agreed, at least pending the information requested some weeks ago

 15:37:07 <bdmurray> slangasek: oh, so if he was doing it right he would have tagged it?

 15:37:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: yeah

 15:37:31 <slangasek> I think he was targeting it for his /own/ team to work on :)

 15:37:46 <xnox> jodh: bug 740390 is interesting, but to be solved not in upstart package?! But still interesting bug.

 15:37:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 740390 in dbus (Ubuntu Quantal) "libdbus-1-3 upgrade does not respawn init, resulting in unclean shutdown" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/740390

 15:38:12 <cjwatson> xnox: Yes, until stateful-reexec lands, the handful of libraries that upstart itself uses need to do this

 15:38:13 <slangasek> untargeting 1017001; still a problem, but only a trickle of bug reports and there's no reason to expect problems here for precise->quantal

 15:38:46 <xnox> cjwatson: ok. so I got it right that stateful reexec solves this generically.

 15:38:47 <cjwatson> jodh: libnih* has the same problem, FWIW

 15:39:25 <slangasek> cjwatson: last comment on 1013681 has you mentioning sudo access on pepo, which we have back now... should we take the server side of that on, or leave it to webops?

 15:39:48 <jodh> cjwatson: ta - I'll take a look.

 15:40:06 <xnox> cjwatson: 20 - 2 incomplete = 18 ;-)

 15:40:28 <cjwatson> slangasek: We should probably take it, but I have a vague memory that it required master key access

 15:40:44 <cjwatson> Which puts it past the 12.10 timeframe anyway

 15:40:49 <slangasek> ok

 15:41:33 * jodh wonders if we need a dh_reexecinit ?

 15:41:38 <slangasek> no

 15:41:41 <cjwatson> There are only a handful of libraries here

 15:41:49 <cjwatson> No need to invent new infrastructure for them

 15:41:55 <slangasek> we need stateful re-exec, and a quick fix for the 4 library packages affected

 15:42:29 <cjwatson> 3, since libc has handled this for years

 15:42:53 <slangasek> yep

 15:43:26 <cjwatson> So one-liner in three postinsts, move on

 15:43:39 * slangasek nods

 15:44:02 <stgraber> cjwatson: turns out I forgot to push the changes we SRUed at the last minute for 12.04.1 to quantal, so I'm just going to bring the two ubuntu-defaults-zh-cn back in sync which should fix the bug in the process

 15:44:12 <cjwatson> stgraber: Ah, OK, great

 15:44:55 * xnox \0/

 15:45:05 <slangasek> so, having turfed 1026778 I guess I'll take another one

 15:45:08 <cjwatson> In fact I see that Marc has done libdbus-1-3 in -proposed

 15:45:13 <cjwatson> Which I'll copy to quantal nowish

 15:45:26 <cjwatson> So it's just libnih to fix

 15:45:26 <slangasek> maybe bug #1051110 unless someone else wants to look at that one

 15:45:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1051110 in update-manager (Ubuntu Quantal) "ucf debconf prompt lands in hidden terminal instead of using gnome frontend" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1051110

 15:45:56 <bdmurray> slangasek: I'm interested in that one

 15:46:14 <slangasek> bdmurray: interested in taking it, or in having me resolve it? :)

 15:46:28 <bdmurray> slangasek: having a go at it ;-)

 15:47:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: ok, be my guest!

 15:47:24 <barry> one suggestion, though probably everyone already does this.  if you're looking at a bug, assign it to yourself so we don't step on each others toes.  you can always unassign it if you punt

 15:47:28 <xnox> slangasek: bdmurray: well I comment on it, with potential duplicates =) it's not new ;-)

 15:47:57 <slangasek> xnox: it's new behavior here for me

 15:48:37 <slangasek> xnox: the bug I'm reporting is *not* about the terminal not auto-expanding; it's about the wrong debconf frontend being used here

 15:48:51 <bdmurray> bug 1052605 will fall off the next time the report is created

 15:48:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1052605 in update-manager (Ubuntu Quantal) "ERROR:root:getListFromFile: no '/usr/share/update-manager/removal_blacklist.cfg' found: exception during Precise to Quantal upgrade" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1052605

 15:49:32 <cjwatson> Yeah, that was due to collisions in the queue I believe.  Thanks for cleaning that up.

 15:50:50 <bdmurray> Oh and bug 1058102 will get added

 15:50:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1058102 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu Quantal) "The strings in "ubuntu-release-upgrader" is not translated in UI" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1058102

 15:50:53 <xnox> slangasek: I see the distinction now. But surely you'd never need terminal to auto-expand if all questions correctly used the GUI debconf frontend.

 15:51:41 <infinity> xnox: You're assuming all questions are debconf. :P

 15:51:47 <slangasek> xnox: the auto-expanding is still needed in case of bugs

 15:51:51 <cjwatson> Indeed.  Consider conffile prompts.

 15:52:05 <slangasek> conffile prompts are also proxied by update-manager to the gui :)

 15:52:19 * cjwatson stands corrected

 15:52:26 <slangasek> anyway, I think we've devoured that bug list adequately for today

 15:52:29 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:52:32 <slangasek> Anything else?

 15:53:04 <barry> monday is a usa holiday but i'll probably swap it and work

 15:53:19 <infinity> Canadia too, and I think I'll take it. :P

 15:53:27 <ogra_> pfft

 15:53:28 <bdmurray> I'm swapping it also

 15:53:29 <ogra_> holidays

 15:53:57 * xnox booked a holiday

 15:54:17 <xnox> I can see how monday will not go wrong.

 15:55:05 <slangasek> I'll be off Monday

 15:55:08 <slangasek> so enjoy :)
