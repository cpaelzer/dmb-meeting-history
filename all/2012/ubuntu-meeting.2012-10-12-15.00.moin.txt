 15:02:28 <skaet> ..

 15:02:30 <skaet> thanks to those who had them in yesterday.  I tried to pick up the ones that landed this morning,

 15:02:32 <skaet> but may have missed some.

 15:02:40 <arosales> skaet: apologies for server being so tardy

 15:02:40 <arosales> ..

 15:02:46 <skaet> if there are any late additions,  please post them in the channel.

 15:02:48 <skaet> :)

 15:03:06 <skaet> arosales,  got some questions for you,  so close enough ;)

 15:03:12 <skaet> and on that note

 15:03:19 <skaet> #topic comments and questions

 15:03:22 <Riddell> hi

 15:03:44 * ogra_ is here

 15:03:47 <skaet> can we have a round of hello's, etc.  so I can see who is here

 15:03:48 * smartboyhw is here

 15:04:02 <gilir> hi

 15:04:06 <roadmr> hey!

 15:04:09 <plars> hi

 15:04:14 <arosales> hello

 15:04:21 <seb128> hey!

 15:04:40 <mdeslaur> hello

 15:04:46 <brendand> hi

 15:04:57 <popey> o/

 15:05:02 <smartboyhw> That's a lot of people:D

 15:05:11 <doko> hi

 15:05:14 <skaet> thanks!   great,  looks like we should have quorum for some of the questions.

 15:05:26 <xnox> hola!

 15:05:34 <Riddell> are we nearly there yet?

 15:05:55 <skaet> First question,   any release blockers on people's radar that haven't made their way into the #ubuntu-release channel?

 15:06:05 <skaet> Riddell,  yup,  nearly there.   ;)

 15:06:11 <skaet> one more week to go.

 15:06:44 <skaet> I know that Kubuntu is likely to need at least one more respin after this current set of images publishes.

 15:06:46 <seb128> skaet, we figured out that thunderbird indicator-messages integration got broken with the tb16 updates in quantal, not really a blocker but one of those annoying bugs

 15:06:55 <seb128> just mentioning it

 15:06:56 <seb128> ..

 15:07:04 * smartboyhw is waiting for the set of new images:D

 15:07:07 <skaet> seb128, thanks for mentioning,  is there a bug number

 15:07:07 <highvoltage> fo/

 15:07:20 <seb128> skaet, https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1065919

 15:07:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1065919 in thunderbird (Ubuntu Quantal) "thunderbird 16 updates broke messaging menu integration" [High,New]

 15:07:33 <skaet> thanks seb128.

 15:07:40 <seb128> skaet, chris already has a fix and will upload to proposed so your call if you want it in or as a SRU

 15:07:58 <skaet> perfect.   :)  ok will look into it after the meeting.

 15:08:01 <skaet> ..

 15:08:17 <micahg_> FWIW, the thunderbird issue only affects edubuntu and ubuntu, not xubuntu

 15:08:18 <skaet> go highvoltage  (if that's a question, otherwise,  hello ;) )

 15:08:36 <highvoltage> (sorry, it was a hello on a bad wifi connection)

 15:08:40 <skaet> micahg,  good input.  will make sure to note that on the pad

 15:08:56 <skaet> anything on the worry list from the edubuntu side highvoltage?

 15:09:22 <highvoltage> skaet: nothing new has popped up, at least

 15:09:45 <skaet> good to know.  ok.

 15:09:50 <arosales> \o

 15:09:55 <skaet> go arosales

 15:10:29 <arosales> not a release blocker, but something we'll need to address soon after release is cloud-images for Azure; bug 1065070 and bug 1055686

 15:10:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1065070 in linux (Ubuntu) "initrd not being loaded on Windows Azure" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1065070

 15:10:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1055686 in Ubuntu "Ubuntu 12.10 cloud images do not full provision on Azure" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1055686

 15:10:52 <arosales> still under investigation. Documented in the quantal release notes.

 15:11:08 <skaet> Thanks for that arosales.   that was going to be my next question.  ;)

 15:11:41 <skaet> other question I had for you,   was on the MAAS on ARM.   What is the outlook there?

 15:12:07 <arosales> skaet: highbank support for MAAS should be there.

 15:13:01 <arosales> we'll need to do an new hardware SRU to include armadaxp. The ground work is there, but the ephemeral images need updated.

 15:13:31 <skaet> arosales, understood.  :/

 15:13:32 <arosales> ..

 15:14:57 <skaet> Riddell,   are there any of the issues outstanding that you were mentioning konversation translations, investigate and hopefully fix apport crash on reporting a bug, fix kubuntu active broken widget on line in your summary,  that we should be treating as blockers?

 15:15:29 * skaet should have stuck quotes around part from Riddell's email,  sorry.

 15:15:47 <Riddell> I was wondering :)

 15:16:28 <Riddell> that ubiquity issue is fix committed so I expect a respin for that

 15:16:47 <Riddell> the other one was I was hoping to get kubuntu-doc translations in but I guess that's too late

 15:16:53 <Riddell> nudge nudge Darkwing

 15:17:10 <Riddell> the other issues I have my eye on I can live with

 15:17:20 <skaet> ok.  thanks.

 15:19:09 <skaet> ..?

 15:19:34 * skaet assumes so

 15:19:35 <Riddell> ..

 15:19:38 <skaet> :)

 15:20:08 <ogra_> on arm there is bug 1065902

 15:20:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1065902 in linux-ti-omap4 (Ubuntu) "black/blue screen before installer, tty switch fixes it" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1065902

 15:20:26 <ogra_> that one looks a bit worrying, i think ppisati is still collecting debug data though

 15:21:02 <skaet> thanks ogra_ - will add it to the list to monitor closely then.

 15:22:30 <skaet> ..?

 15:22:38 <ogra_> ..

 15:22:40 <skaet> :)

 15:22:41 <ogra_> :)

 15:23:12 <skaet> popey,   it looked like there were things lined up for SRU updates, but nothing left on the release blocker list for unity stack team.   Is this accurate?

 15:23:40 <popey> we have some things lined up for SRU0 yes, still poking for a few more fixes if we can squeeze them in

 15:23:46 <popey> but no blockers I'm aware of

 15:23:48 <popey> ..

 15:24:09 <skaet> Thanks popey.  :)  delighted to hear that!

 15:24:54 <skaet> anyone else have questions about this upcoming week?

 15:25:04 <popey> we also had awesome help from didrocks & gord to slip in a last minute update yesterday to alleviate some legal questions.

 15:25:04 <popey> ..

 15:25:23 <skaet> :)  indeed.

 15:26:32 <skaet> Status will be tracked for respins on http://pad.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-release

 15:26:46 <skaet> There is currently a set being created.

 15:27:25 <skaet> anyone finding something that needs investigating as a possible blocker,  please feel free to add it to the "under investigation" list by bug number.

 15:28:11 <skaet> The iso tracker will be kept up to date as well with the rebuild status,  so you know the latest.

 15:28:38 <skaet> teams have reviewed the tests on the iso tracker now,  (thanks balloons,  :) ) so they should be in good shape too now.

 15:29:02 <skaet> So,  what's left now is to validate that the images emerging today are good to ship.  :)

 15:29:32 <skaet> If someone sees an issue please make sure to raise it in #ubuntu-release if its a likely blocker, or use #ubuntu-testing to discuss.

 15:29:50 <skaet> both lists will be monitored closely for the next week by the release and qa teams.

 15:30:09 <skaet> Any one have questions?

 15:30:41 <arosales> \o [comment]

 15:31:04 <skaet> go arosales

 15:31:11 <arosales> skaet: Just wanted to say thanks for always keeping us on track, and being so helpful. :-)

 15:31:58 * seb128 hugs skaet

 15:32:01 <skaet> As we enter the final push to get 12.10 wrapped up and released, just wanted to say thank you to all of you for your hard work on getting 12.10 polished up and ready to ship.   We pulled together a lot of cool new stuff in this release!   Well done!!!!

 15:32:15 <arosales> +1

 15:32:18 <smartboyhw> +1

 15:32:19 <seb128> skaet, thanks as well for the hard work ;-)

 15:32:39 * smartboyhw bows to skaet (as in Chinese tradition)

 15:32:55 <skaet> thanks!  :)

 15:33:21 <skaet> and on that note,   lets go validate some images,   and get it shipped.  :D
