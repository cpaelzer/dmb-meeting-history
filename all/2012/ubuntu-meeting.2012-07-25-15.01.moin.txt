 15:11:12 <slangasek> oh, braille

 15:11:14 <jodh> - can now serialise and deserialise dbus messages.

 15:11:17 <jodh> - next stages:

 15:11:20 <jodh> - modify enum handling to handle enum changes.

 15:11:25 <jodh> - handle ptraced jobs.

 15:11:25 <jodh> - consider re-exec scenarios.

 15:11:28 <jodh> - add meta-header.

 15:11:41 <jodh> 

 15:11:47 <jodh> slangasek: hence the scrollback comment ;)

 15:11:56 <slangasek> jodh: no, he's not connected to the channel

 15:12:05 <slangasek> so he won't have scrollback to see it in :)

 15:12:10 <jodh> oh well - he'll have to read it on irclogs :)

 15:12:17 <ogra_> poor boy missing all the barille fun

 15:12:27 <bdmurray> wrote a test case for SRU of bug 1006633 for precise and realized code was wrong

 15:12:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1006633 in apport (Ubuntu Precise) "should collect /etc/default/grub from package install failures due to update-grub failing" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1006633

 15:12:30 <bdmurray> wrote and tested a new fix for bug 1006633 for quantal and precise

 15:12:33 <bdmurray> wrote, tested and uploaded a fix for bug 1007637 regarding blocking package installation failures

 15:12:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1007637 in apport (Ubuntu Precise) "ubuntu general hook should check to see if package install failure has already happened" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1007637

 15:12:36 <bdmurray> setup rls-mgr and qa team reports on cranberry as ubuntureports

 15:12:37 <bdmurray> removed code to create reports being made by arsenal from the ubuntu-reports branch

 15:12:40 <bdmurray> patch pilot

 15:12:43 <bdmurray> uploaded kerneloops that disables it due to crashers when trying to run the daemon

 15:12:46 <bdmurray> fixed gnuplot scripts that run on lillypilly and create pkgstats graphs

 15:12:57 <bdmurray> modify ultimate debian database code to mark same title bugs as duplicates

 15:13:05 <slangasek> yay test cases :)

 15:13:31 <slangasek> does "ubuntureports" mean urls are changing?

 15:14:17 <bdmurray> slangasek: no, just a different user that multiple people can su to and emails regarding cronjobs

 15:14:22 <slangasek> ok

 15:14:35 <slangasek> (done)?

 15:14:47 <bdmurray> yes, done

 15:15:04 <slangasek> stokachu: hi, anything to add this week?

 15:16:11 <slangasek> sounds like no

 15:16:13 <slangasek> moving on

 15:16:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] 12.04.1

 15:16:25 <slangasek> stgraber: you have the floor :)

 15:16:35 <stgraber> yay!

 15:16:43 <stgraber> Full bug list can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=49926

 15:16:46 <stgraber> I went through the upload queue and updated the status of these bugs to In-progress so that I can get a better idea of what's going on.

 15:16:50 <stgraber> The biggest foundation-related SRU currently in the queue is mdadm, fixing one critical bug and 7 others but it's quite large and hasn't been reviewed yet.

 15:16:53 <stgraber> The list below is for any remaining foundation-related issue that's not marked "In progress" (waiting in unapproved) or "Fix commited" (currently in -proposed).

 15:16:57 <stgraber> We went from 33 bugs in last week's meeting down to 16 this week (granted, marking all of xnox's as in-progress helped quite a bit ;)!

 15:17:17 <stgraber> so, now to what's left to do:

 15:17:23 <stgraber> Package management: bug 1017001, bug 926340, bug 924079

 15:17:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017001 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "package resolvconf 1.63ubuntu14 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: pre-dependency problem - not installing resolvconf" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017001

 15:17:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 926340 in aptdaemon (Ubuntu Precise) "aptd crashed with UnicodeDecodeError in _set_error(): 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/926340

 15:17:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924079 in apt (Ubuntu Precise) "do-release-upgrade fails to upgrade from Oneiric to Precise: Couldn't configure pre-depend libtinfo5 for libncurses5, probably a dependency cycle" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924079

 15:17:55 <stgraber> the first one is assigned to mvo but he's having a hard time trying to reproduce it, so not much progress was done on it

 15:18:07 * slangasek nods

 15:18:16 <stgraber> Filesystem bugs: bug 978012

 15:18:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 978012 in e2fsprogs (Ubuntu Precise) "Please SRU micro bug fix release of e2fsprogs 1.42.4-3ubuntu1 (main) from Quantal (main)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/978012

 15:18:30 <stgraber> this one was in the queue last week IIRC but isn't anymore, what happened?

 15:18:33 <stgraber> xnox: ?

 15:18:40 <xnox> this one, infinity rejected the upload. and said that he will discuss it with me tomorrow.

 15:18:50 <stgraber> ok

 15:19:03 <stgraber> Installer: bug 991982 (private, assigned to me), bug 484252, bug 946406, bug 966480, bug 987411

 15:19:07 <slangasek> bdmurray: are we much closer to being able to have apt clone attachments stay around again?  probably too late to do any good for bug #1017001 in .1, but seems the shortest path to getting that fixed regardless

 15:19:08 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 991982 could not be found

 15:19:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 484252 in usb-creator (Ubuntu Precise) "Format action wipes all partitions" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/484252

 15:20:27 <stgraber> if we can't have bug 1017001 fixed for .1, we really should have a way to get apt-clones of these systems at least. I'm expecting quite a few of them to hit that failure as people start upgrading

 15:20:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017001 in apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "package resolvconf 1.63ubuntu14 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: pre-dependency problem - not installing resolvconf" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017001

 15:20:56 <bdmurray> slangasek: I think it is in the -proposed queue

 15:21:11 <slangasek> ah

 15:21:38 <stgraber> the casper bugs are quite racy, I spent most of Monday trying to reproduce them without much luck... asked for some more details but at this pace it seems less and less likely to be fixed for the point release

 15:21:48 <slangasek> bdmurray: apport/2.0.1-0ubuntu12?

 15:22:31 <bdmurray> slangasek: no, actually not as it needs a new apt-clone too

 15:22:42 <slangasek> bdmurray: ok

 15:22:53 <slangasek> bdmurray: can you make that a priority for this week?

 15:22:58 <bdmurray> slangasek: yes

 15:23:02 <slangasek> ta

 15:24:31 <bdmurray> slangasek: actually its update-manager and apt-clone that need uploading and there is currently an update-manager in precise-proposed that needs verifying

 15:24:52 <slangasek> can anyone here help with that update-manager verification?

 15:25:05 <slangasek> stgraber: when does the freeze for .1 go into effect?  End of the month?

 15:25:52 <stgraber> slangasek: 2nd of August

 15:26:01 <slangasek> ah, a thursday freeze :)

 15:26:09 <jibel_> bdmurray, u-m bug number that need verification ?

 15:26:11 <slangasek> so we have just over a week for uploads

 15:26:21 <bdmurray> jibel_: bug 1002956

 15:26:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1002956 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "Missing ReleaseNotesViewerWebkit.py from package" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1002956

 15:26:25 <jibel_> ta

 15:26:32 <slangasek> stgraber: I think the bugs that are not yet assigned to anyone need to be un-milestoned then

 15:26:51 <bdmurray> jibel_: and bug 979661 though it has no specific test case

 15:26:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 979661 in update-manager (Ubuntu Precise) "oneiric to precise: debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Gnome and falls back to Dialog" [Critical,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/979661

 15:26:54 <slangasek> I don't think it's realistic that they're going to get fixes in the next week

 15:27:12 <stgraber> jibel_: the other bug in that SRU is a race condition, so not really verifyable, regression testing is good enough for that (I'd count the test of bug 1002956 as regression testing for bug 979661)

 15:27:46 <jibel_> ok, I'll do the verification

 15:28:03 <bdmurray> jibel_: great, thanks!

 15:28:37 <stgraber> slangasek: usb-creator was fixed in quantal, I'll assign it to me to look for a cherry-pick.

 15:28:49 <slangasek> stgraber: ah, great

 15:29:08 <stgraber> slangasek: the two others, I'll bump to .2 as they seem rather annoying and at least the shadow bug has been hitting quite a lot of people

 15:29:09 <slangasek> sorry, I assumed it was not-fixed-in-quantal, like most of the ones remaining

 15:29:26 <slangasek> yes, that sounds good

 15:29:52 <slangasek> as for the rest of the bugs... if you have a .1 bug assigned to you, please get the fix in BEFORE next Thursday

 15:30:02 <slangasek> or speak up now if you think you're not going to make that deadline

 15:30:34 <xnox> slangasek: is this deadline for: upload, accepted, or copied into -updates?

 15:30:51 <stgraber> upload, ideally accepted

 15:31:02 <jodh> slangasek: no guarantees on a fix for bug 980917 at this stage. I'll keep prodding though.

 15:31:02 <slangasek> yes - and definitely not the last

 15:31:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 980917 in upstart (Ubuntu Precise) "Failed to create pty - disabling logging for job" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/980917

 15:31:05 <stgraber> we have an extra couple of weeks for veriyfying the fixes and getting them to -updates after that

 15:31:18 <slangasek> jodh: understood

 15:31:49 <xnox> well. I don't know what's up with e2fsprogs. mdadm bugs should be ok.

 15:32:01 * slangasek nods

 15:32:06 <stgraber> I have two bugs that won't make it by next Thursday but that's on purpose as these will be pushed through -security at the last minute

 15:33:18 <slangasek> stgraber: anything else?

 15:34:00 <xnox> slangasek: i am guessing these deadlines are for stuff on the cd, e.g. do we have any multi-arch bugs pending from stokachu ?

 15:34:28 <slangasek> yes, these are the deadlines for images

 15:34:45 <slangasek> I think the multiarch bugs are the ones stgraber already covered

 15:34:46 <stgraber> slangasek: nope, that's it for 12.04.1

 15:35:03 <slangasek> stgraber: great, thanks for the update!

 15:35:06 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:35:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: how about in quantal?

 15:35:22 <stgraber> slangasek: right, 4 multi-arch bugs are still pending, starting to wonder if they'll make it at all (still no rdepends rebuild test) ...

 15:36:01 <xnox> stgraber: hmm.. i have a cloud to do rdepends rebuild. What is needed? can be done very quickly.

 15:36:01 <bdmurray> bug 1022629 and 1024861 look like a recurrance of bug 541595

 15:36:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1022629 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "package libdbusmenu-glib4 0.6.2-0ubuntu0.1 failed to install/upgrade: package libdbusmenu-glib4 is already installed and configured" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1022629

 15:36:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1024861 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "package language-pack-en 1:12.04+20120618 failed to install/upgrade: package language-pack-en is already installed and configured" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1024861

 15:36:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 541595 in dpkg "[Master] package failed to install/upgrade: package is already installed and configured" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/541595

 15:37:26 <stgraber> xnox: rdepends rebuild using the packages in bugs 977947, 977952, 932860, 859600 (so, the usual, uploading the new library, waiting for it to build+publish, then upload no-change-rebuilds of all the rdepends and check that they still all build)

 15:37:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 932860 in appmenu-gtk (Ubuntu Precise) "Broken (or missing) multiarch support" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/932860

 15:38:01 <xnox> stgraber: ok. I can do that.

 15:38:16 <slangasek> xnox: thanks :)

 15:38:26 <xnox> nice smallish rebuild test with a small amount of packages (as in, not the whole archive ;-) just a bit of it )

 15:38:36 <stgraber> xnox: cool. If you do, let arges and stokachu know so you don't end up duplicating the work :)

 15:39:26 <slangasek> bdmurray: the logs in bug #1024861 don't give much to go on

 15:39:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1024861 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "package language-pack-en 1:12.04+20120618 failed to install/upgrade: package language-pack-en is already installed and configured" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1024861

 15:40:29 <slangasek> nor does bug #1022629, really

 15:40:30 <bdmurray> slangasek: what more do we need?  I suspect there are a lot of these

 15:40:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1022629 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "package libdbusmenu-glib4 0.6.2-0ubuntu0.1 failed to install/upgrade: package libdbusmenu-glib4 is already installed and configured" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1022629

 15:40:41 <slangasek> bdmurray: well, the dpkg term log just looks truncated to me

 15:41:03 <slangasek> though maybe I'm just wishing it were truncated

 15:41:46 <bdmurray> well apport does truncate it to the last activity

 15:42:37 <slangasek> so I suspect that we may only be seeing logs from a "cleanup" run after some other failure

 15:42:53 <slangasek> and that we might need to know the nature of the original failure to understand the bug

 15:42:59 <bdmurray> okay, I'll ask for /var/log/apt/term.log then

 15:43:05 <slangasek> great, thanks

 15:43:36 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:44:04 <bdmurray> nope, things are getting resolved pretty quickly

 15:44:10 <slangasek> excellent :)

 15:44:16 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:45:17 <slangasek> going once...
