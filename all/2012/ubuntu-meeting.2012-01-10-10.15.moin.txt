 10:19:59 <elky> yep, we can return to them if they return

 10:20:25 <head_victim> Ok and ok with removing and emailing them to reapply when able, since it's 3 meetings in a row they've missed?

 10:20:28 <head_victim> Or jsut leave them there

 10:21:04 <Destine> head_victim, ok.

 10:21:17 <Destine> head_victim, just return.

 10:21:20 <head_victim> ok I can't see vibhave either, we'll move along

 10:21:28 <head_victim> #topic sagaci

 10:21:44 <sagaci> Hi

 10:21:59 <head_victim> Good evening sagaci, please introduce yourself to the board members  in a sentence or two sum up your application :)

 10:22:11 <head_victim> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoelPickett

 10:23:21 <sagaci> Hi, I'm Joel Pickett I'm 24 and an Ubuntu enthusiast residing in Australia and thus help out with the ubuntu-au loco team. My main contribution to the ubuntu ecosystem has been to en_AU translation

 10:24:15 <head_victim> And just for the others who aren't as familiar with your work I'd like to point out your karma points

 10:24:17 <head_victim> #link https://launchpad.net/~jpickett/+karma

 10:24:31 <elky> can you tell us what you've done in the translations in the past few months, sagaci?

 10:24:33 <sagaci> lot of long nights :)

 10:24:38 * elky might already know :P

 10:25:17 <sagaci> I started translations around March/April (mostly from head_victim's translation Jam) and have just taken a stab at getting the job done

 10:25:47 <elky> how far did you get?

 10:25:59 <sagaci> I started to set minor goals of completion, and as time went past, I started to realise that it was possible to get it "all" done

 10:26:32 <sagaci> we've got 2 untranslated strings out of ~360,000, which are a system glitch and can't be translated anyway

 10:27:09 <elky> And, translation in the case of localised english is going through and doing what?

 10:27:10 <sagaci> we went from around 45% done to 99.999 done in a cycle and a half, roughly

 10:28:11 <sagaci> changing specific strings from en_US to en_AU... thus words such as dialog, localized, color, meter and a few others

 10:28:32 <elky> :)

 10:28:37 <head_victim> And how have you contributed to the AU loco?

 10:29:08 <sagaci> I've chaired the ubuntu-au meetings since june, (bi-monthly) actually with Joel Addison

 10:29:38 <Destine> sagaci, sounds good.

 10:29:53 <elky> Destine, tumbleweed, do you have any further questions?

 10:30:05 <Destine> elky, nope.

 10:30:07 <sagaci> I've prepared meeting, events (such as the translation jam for the oneiric cycle), and organised the en_AU localised ISO project

 10:34:41 <head_victim> Welcome to Ubutnu membership sagaci :)

 10:34:45 <popey> congrats sagaci

 10:34:54 <sagaci> thanks all

 10:35:17 <head_victim> In the interests of maintaining quorum we'll quickly proceed to the next applicant

 10:35:25 <head_victim> #topic oscalation

 10:35:45 <head_victim> oscalation: can you please give us a brief introduction to yourself and your contributions while we read over your wiki application

 10:35:51 <oscalation> Sure.

 10:35:57 <oscalation> Hello, Im Nathan aka Oscalation. My wiki page is found here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/oscalation. Im active in Launchpad answers and Ubuntu Documentation. Ive found that answering questions on Launchpad usually is tied with Fixing or updating Ubuntu doc pages. I have just hit my 3K Karma threshold and look forward to hitting 6k. Im active in my local community as the go to computer guy and promote and suggest Ubuntu on a regular Basis.

 10:36:00 <head_victim> sagaci: well done

 10:37:11 <head_victim> oscalation: my first question is about testimonials, I notice there were  several email testimonials but none listed on your wiki page.

 10:37:25 <head_victim> And none of them were very specific as to what your actions were

 10:37:38 <Destine> head_victim, and they look quite alike.

 10:38:59 <oscalation> Yeah. I didnt notice that testimonials were excepted on your personal wiki page until the other night.  I spoke with a few friends and asked them kindly if they would support my Membership application by following the instruction on the Membership page.

 10:39:11 <oscalation> Send an email to the mailing list.

 10:40:15 <elky> What's the significance of the number 1465?

 10:40:56 <oscalation> Just a common string I use when registering email address's

 10:41:57 <elky> Such as one of the email addresses that sent a testimony?

 10:42:42 <oscalation> Its possible. I have a few friends and family members that ive assisted with setting up free email accounts on gmail / yahoo.

 10:44:23 <elky> oscalation, we prefer testimonials from other ubuntu contributors telling us how an applicant participates in the community.

 10:44:54 <head_victim> oscalation: sorry for taking a while, we're having to do a bit of research as the testimonials weren't very specific on your involvements, can you tell us how you cotnribute to your loco?

 10:45:06 <tumbleweed> I also would really prefer testimonials from ubuntu members (or people we know from the community)

 10:45:29 <Destine> tumbleweed, i can't agree more.

 10:45:32 <oscalation> I see. In this case I have had users that I have supported or helped personally send in testimonials. There personal contributions I cannot account for but I do know that I should have a least one testimonial from a well known Ubuntu Member

 10:46:06 <Destine> oscalation, does not have to be a well known member. a member will be fine.

 10:46:36 <oscalation> A member being an official member of the Ubuntu Membership team?

 10:46:45 <oscalation> Or just a user of Ubuntu?

 10:46:46 <elky> anyone active enough to be recognisable to us, really

 10:46:59 <Destine> oscalation, yes.

 10:47:16 <head_victim> Well I think we're all starting to float around the same idea. Would I be safe in assuming we'd probably like to see more documentation of contributions to ensure their significant and sustained before approving?

 10:47:20 <oscalation> I may have a testimonial from ActionParsenip

 10:48:40 <oscalation> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ActionParsnip

 10:49:08 <oscalation> Not certain though i may

 10:49:08 <head_victim> #vote oscalation (Nathan Heafner)'s Ubuntu Membership Application

 10:49:08 <meetingology> Please vote on: oscalation (Nathan Heafner)'s Ubuntu Membership Application

 10:49:08 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (private votes don't work yet, but when they do it will be by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0 to me)

 10:49:49 <tumbleweed> -0 I do see good activity on launchpad. But I'd really like to e endorsement from ubuntu members

 10:50:04 <tumbleweed> err  he doesn't do -0

 10:50:05 <tumbleweed> +0

 10:50:05 <meetingology> +0 received from tumbleweed

 10:50:19 * tumbleweed runs away offline

 10:50:28 <oscalation> How many +1's do i need?

 10:50:32 <head_victim> +0 I would like to see more testimonials giving details of involvement activities rather than general comments

 10:50:32 <meetingology> +0 I would like to see more testimonials giving details of involvement activities rather than general comments received from head_victim

 10:50:36 <Destine> +0 i would like to see recognizable testimonials.

 10:50:43 <Destine> +0 sorry.

 10:50:43 <meetingology> +0 sorry. received from Destine

 10:51:02 <oscalation> The testimonials is unfair, your request isnt clearly listed as a requirement

 10:51:12 <elky> -0 recognisable testimonials that better document participation are needed

 10:51:20 <oscalation> "If you have questions or wish to give private testimonials email ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com (your message may initially be held for moderation) "

 10:51:28 <elky> +0 recognisable testimonials that better document participation are needed

 10:51:28 <meetingology> +0 recognisable testimonials that better document participation are needed received from elky

 10:52:15 <head_victim> oscalation: but your wiki application doesn't actually give us much in the way of specifics. If you had some testimonials from the people in the testing team or the documentation team outlineing your contributions that would really help

 10:52:20 <Destine> oscalation, I think you can return on the next meeting carrying enough recognizable testimonials. we can assess them latter.

 10:52:24 <elky> oscalation, "this dude answered my questions" isn't the right kind of testimonial for "sustained and significant contribution"

 10:53:33 <oscalation> While I cant control what users sent in as testimonials, I would think that any sent in would be taken into consideration. Again the users im assisting locally generally speaking are users looking for assistance, not users making outstanding contributions back to Ubuntu.

 10:54:07 <elky> You got a 0, not a -1

 10:54:37 <head_victim> oscalation: and that's fine but membership requires significant and sustained contributions. Helping family members out with their computers is not a significant contribution. Helping out the testing team with ISO testing or the documentation team with updating documentation over a sustained period is.

 10:55:14 <oscalation> ?There are many different ways of contributing to Ubuntu. Contributions are valued and recognized whether you contribute to artwork, any of the LoCoTeams, documentation, providing support on the forums, the answers tracker, IRC support, bug triage, translation, development and packaging, marketing and advocacy, contributing to the wiki, or anything else."

 10:55:44 <elky> oscalation, if your contributions are significant and sustained, then you can put the skills you apply to documenting on listing in fine detail what exactly you do on your application page for next time.

 10:56:30 <elky> Arguing the point with us is not going to endear us for the next attempt.

 10:57:08 <head_victim> oscalation: it's not uncommon for people to not pass on the first attempt. All we have requested tonight is to take on board the suggestion that is' hard for us to determine if your contributions are sugnificant and sustained at this point in time with the information we have been presented.

 10:57:56 <Destine> oscalation, you are always welcome on the next meeting.

 10:58:03 <oscalation> It's my personal opinion that my launchpad page shows sustained contributions. Maybe im wrong.

 10:59:10 <elky> oscalation, it's our opinion that matters here.

 10:59:41 <oscalation> elky, understood. I move to retract my membership application.

 10:59:54 <meetingology> Votes for:0 Votes against:0 Abstentions:4

 10:59:54 <meetingology> Motion denied

 10:59:59 <head_victim> Sorry I meant to do that before

 11:00:09 <oscalation> Is there an appeals process?

 11:01:01 <head_victim> oscalation: you have to understand, we only have 10 minutes to evaluate your entire performance, going back and reworking the wiki page shouldn't be too difficult to manage to provide a more complete application so we can accurately see your contributions.

 11:01:46 <oscalation> I understand head_victim , and I appreciate the guidance. Thanks for your time.

 11:03:11 <oscalation> I will re-apply for the next meeting if thats ok.

 11:03:27 <Destine> oscalation, you are always welcome.

 11:03:29 <head_victim> oscalation: by all means, please make sure you have more information at the ready

 11:04:02 <oscalation> You want more work in Ubuntu docs listed on my wiki?

 11:04:28 <head_victim> oscalation: your launchpad page suggests you're in the testing and documentation teams so I thought if you'd contributed to them it would be helpful to list them

 11:04:29 <Destine> oscalation, yes.

 11:05:14 <oscalation> Do my contributions to Launchpad currently show as sustained and significant?

 11:05:21 <head_victim> And if you knew someone in either of those teams who've seen your contributions then get them to add a testimonial thtat they can sign

 11:05:48 <oscalation> I swore actionparsnip sent in a testimonial. Maybe not though.

 11:05:58 <head_victim> oscalation: answers in and of themselves are hard to gauge due to the fact we can't be sure that they've all been helpful without going through each one of them ourselves.

 11:06:16 <head_victim> So if there is someone that has seen you assist others over a period of time and can vouch for the quality of your answers that would really help as well

 11:06:28 <popey> oscalation: I'd recommed updating your wiki page. it's quite thin

 11:07:05 <oscalation> My contrubtions to my local community are also hard to gauge as the users them-self generally speaking contribute nothing back as they are users looking for assistance, not looking to help.

 11:07:44 <head_victim> oscalation: well to use an example, the previous applicant had chaired meetings, organised events, run ubuntu user days, that sort of thign

 11:07:55 <popey> photos help too ☺

 11:08:06 <oscalation> These are my neighbors from my local town hall, not three friends in my basement might I add.

 11:08:19 <popey> you keep your friends in your basement?

 11:08:20 <elky> oscalation, in that case we'd be looking for installfests or institutions mailing us to tell us how much you helped them, not all the handful of people whose email addresses you set up.

 11:08:31 <oscalation> I actually slimmed down my wiki page because the application process states "A summary of your contributions to Ubuntu (no longer than 2-3 lines) "

 11:08:54 <oscalation> elky, that would seem to indicate that this type of contribution is meaningless

 11:09:08 <Destine> oscalation, they are indeed valued.

 11:09:13 <Destine> oscalation, but we need proof.

 11:10:28 <elky> oscalation, membership is supposed to signify exceptional contribution.
