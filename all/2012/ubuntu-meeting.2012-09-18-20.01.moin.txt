 20:10:03 <BlackEco> *before I do

 20:10:18 <czajkowski> cm-t: the application is impressive.

 20:10:36 <cm-t> so we are done 2 years, with many event all over the France, we try to find new way to catch new people to ubuntu

 20:10:53 <czajkowski> cm-t: so how do you get people involved in the loco, it's rather large

 20:11:34 <cm-t> we focused a lot to get new people as user, and as you espected well, now we need to focus to grow our community

 20:11:43 <itnet7> Very nice job on giving all of the details on the wiki

 20:12:01 <czajkowski> xdatap1: any questions

 20:12:24 <olive> we organize great and big events to attract many volounteers

 20:12:44 <xdatap1> czajkowski, I'm just amazed by their wiki page.

 20:13:18 <itnet7> ditto

 20:13:24 <YoBoY> (and there is so much more to put on this page… ^^")

 20:13:56 <czajkowski> so opening up to anyone YoBoY piti anyone have any comments on the French loco ?

 20:14:40 <cm-t> oh yes YoBoY :)

 20:14:55 <czajkowski> YoBoY: so how do you think the loco will grow in next 2 years

 20:15:00 <czajkowski> Also can the LC help in any way

 20:15:01 <YoBoY> like lot of locos we have to focus on recruitement of new contributors

 20:15:46 <olive> we have to expand our Fetivals activity

 20:15:56 <Trium> o/

 20:15:57 <YoBoY> I think the loco can have more event orginizers

 20:16:08 <olive> Festivals*

 20:16:21 <czajkowski> Can I ask does the looc know about the greater ubuntu community ? or is it all focused in France?

 20:16:47 <olive> We have to rebuilt our big website

 20:17:05 <YoBoY> they know we are a big community inside the awesome ubuntu community ;)

 20:17:23 <olive> Ubuntu-fr is focused on French speaking Countries :) not only France

 20:17:29 <cm-t> we are mostly France based, but we try to be french speaking

 20:17:34 <cm-t> olive:  :)
