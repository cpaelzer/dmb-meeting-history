 12:03:31 <cyphermox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for September 12, 2012.

 12:03:40 <cyphermox> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:03:49 <cyphermox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04:00 <cyphermox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04:12 <cyphermox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:04:20 <cyphermox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:04:28 <cyphermox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:04:46 <cyphermox> #voters cyphermox Pendulum head_victim hggdh

 12:04:46 <meetingology> Current voters: Pendulum cyphermox head_victim hggdh

 12:04:51 <head_victim> Let's hope we can get through the long list of applicants tonight ;)

 12:04:56 <cyphermox> omg!

 12:04:57 <untaintableangel> lol

 12:05:05 <cyphermox> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:05:27 <cyphermox> #subtopic Anthony Harrington

 12:05:33 <untaintableangel> Hello, everyone! My Name's Anthony and here's a link to my launchpad page: https://launchpad.net/~untaintableangel

 12:05:45 <untaintableangel> also to my wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AnthonyHarrington

 12:05:57 <cyphermox> #link https://launchpad.net/~untaintableangel

 12:06:07 <cyphermox> #link http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AnthonyHarrington

 12:06:29 <cyphermox> (belt and suspenders, just making sure it's there in the meeting report thingy)

 12:06:39 <untaintableangel> I'm 22, i study chemistry at university and i'm from the northeast of england. I'd like to become an official ubuntu member :D

 12:07:31 <cyphermox> #voters cyphermox Pendulum head_victim hggdh micahg

 12:07:31 <meetingology> Current voters: Pendulum cyphermox head_victim hggdh micahg

 12:09:13 <head_victim> untaintableangel: after reading your application and looking over the links, I'm curious about something. Not to belittle your translation efforts (nice karma for that!) are you involved in any other aspects of the community?

 12:10:04 <untaintableangel> Not currently, but in time i hope to provide coding related contributions and helping users answer questions in the ubuntuforums

 12:10:17 <Pendulum> untaintableangel: Have you had any involvement with the UK LoCo as far as events or interacting with members online other than translations?

 12:11:11 <untaintableangel> Again, not currently, emails sent between me and other launchpad members are predominantly concerning translations

 12:11:55 <cyphermox> untaintableangel: have you had contact with other Ubuntu members in your translation work?

 12:13:43 <cyphermox> Why would you like to be a Ubuntu member?

 12:16:40 <cyphermox> untaintableangel: still around?

 12:17:33 <ant__> oh dear, i think my last message didn't go through, i'll type it again

 12:18:25 <cyphermox> last I saw was "<untaintableangel> Again, not currently, emails sent between me and other launchpad members are predominantly concerning translations"

 12:19:14 <hggdh> let's give him a chance of either (1) finishing his typing, or (2) reconnecting

 12:20:05 <ant__> I was saying, time does become very scarce during university term time and especially around exams so i do unfortunately miss out on events, and i have to contribute where at all possible time-wise.

 12:20:16 <ant__> <untaintableangel> Yes, i get quite a few emails from users seeking advice or requesting assistance to complete a set. Every now and then i make sure to circulate several messages of encouragement to the team/users to spur them on in their efforts :)

 12:20:48 <head_victim> ant__: is that on mailing lists of offlist?

 12:20:59 <hggdh> oh, anr__ == untaintableangle

 12:21:02 <ant__> both

 12:21:09 <hggdh> s/anr__/ant__

 12:21:24 <head_victim> I just hadn't seen much on the engb list in a long time (I'm a subscriber, I translate enAU)

 12:21:27 <ant__> yes, sorry lol i don't know why my idendity changed and i don't know how to change it back XD

 12:21:59 <untaintableangel> there we go, that's better lol

 12:22:12 <untaintableangel> ahhh, hi there

 12:22:18 <head_victim> :)

 12:22:19 <cyphermox> ah, I looked at the engb list too, but just the last few months

 12:23:21 <cyphermox> untaintableangel:  Why would you like to be a Ubuntu member?

 12:24:50 <untaintableangel> I'd love to become an official ubuntu member because i've dedicated many years towards its translations and it has become such a great part of my life that i'd like to 'officially' be 'more intertwined' with it, if you will. lol

 12:25:42 <untaintableangel> What i'm saying is: ubuntu is something to be proud of and i'd like to be officially associated with it

 12:27:35 <hggdh> untaintableangel: what we are trying to ascertain is how involved with the community-at-large you are

 12:27:56 <hggdh> so please give us data on that

 12:28:32 <untaintableangel> i see, well i'm known to other english translators, certainly, and well known to specific teams like emesene

 12:29:00 <untaintableangel> but really, not much outside of launchpad

 12:30:49 <untaintableangel> 'at the moment' being the key point though. I would certainly be more involved at-large if i could contribute coding related things but i don't have the expertise just yet, i'm afraid :(

 12:32:06 <cyphermox> it doesn't have to be coding

 12:32:09 <Pendulum> untaintableangel: there is more "community at large" than just coding (I've never done any translations and I'd been a member for over a year before I did any code)

 12:32:42 <cyphermox> Let's get to the voting part

 12:32:55 <cyphermox> #vote Anthony Harrington to obtain Ubuntu Membership

 12:32:55 <meetingology> Please vote on: Anthony Harrington to obtain Ubuntu Membership

 12:32:55 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (private votes don't work yet, but when they do it will be by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0 to me)

 12:33:45 <hggdh> +1 I would really like to see more community-at-large involvement, but the translation work justifies it (albeit minimally)

 12:33:45 <meetingology> +1 I would really like to see more community-at-large involvement, but the translation work justifies it (albeit minimally) received from hggdh

 12:33:53 <cyphermox> +1 , please get more involved with other parts of the community where possible (like your LoCo team); you could be a great motivator for others to do translation work

 12:33:53 <meetingology> +1 , please get more involved with other parts of the community where possible (like your LoCo team); you could be a great motivator for others to do translation work received from cyphermox

 12:34:03 <head_victim> +1 A suggestion I have moving forward would be to try to interact more with the community in whatever area you like but your efforts to date warrant membership as is

 12:34:03 <meetingology> +1 A suggestion I have moving forward would be to try to interact more with the community in whatever area you like but your efforts to date warrant membership as is received from head_victim

 12:34:35 <Pendulum> +1 good work with translations, but I'd love to see more community interaction (LoCo, maybe translations jams, etc.)

 12:34:35 <meetingology> +1 good work with translations, but I'd love to see more community interaction (LoCo, maybe translations jams, etc.) received from Pendulum

 12:34:41 <untaintableangel> I promise, i won't let you down :)

 12:34:43 <head_victim> untaintableangel: an example of how to get involved without having to code would be to run a translation jam with your loco or something similar :)

 12:34:54 <cyphermox> yeah! that's a great idea

 12:35:04 <untaintableangel> a translation jam?

 12:35:08 <micahg> +0 excellent translations work, but would have liked to see more integration with existing members

 12:35:08 <meetingology> +0 excellent translations work, but would have liked to see more integration with existing members received from micahg

 12:35:23 <cyphermox> especially explaining at least the use and context in translating to en_GB

 12:35:27 <head_victim> untaintableangel: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam

 12:35:52 <Pendulum> untaintableangel: also, if you use IRC at all, hang out in the #ubuntu-uk IRC channel and that may give you some ideas on what's going on that you could do without too much more time on your part

 12:37:17 <cyphermox> (pending I do the necessary magic)

 12:37:23 <hggdh> blogging, yes, good point

 12:37:40 <hggdh> bah, cyphermox IS a magic

 12:37:44 <cyphermox> pff

 12:37:47 <untaintableangel> lol

 12:37:52 <cyphermox> Any other business?

 12:38:18 <hggdh> no, I think we are done, cyphermox

 12:38:23 <cyphermox> good good
