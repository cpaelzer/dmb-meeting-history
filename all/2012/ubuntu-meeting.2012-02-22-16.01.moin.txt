 16:01:59 <slangasek> [TOPIC] lightning round

 16:02:14 <slangasek> well, down by two today... should be a quick meeting yes? :)

 16:02:15 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber ev bdmurray slangasek)

 16:02:15 <slangasek> stgraber bdmurray barry ev doko slangasek

 16:02:27 <stgraber> hello

 16:02:34 <stgraber> - Networking

 16:02:35 <stgraber> - SRUs for ifenslave/vlan/bridge-utils are finally in oneiric-updates!

 16:02:35 <stgraber> - Did some more IPv6 testing, trying to switch to single-stack for part of my network so testing current radvd, NM and squid. Filed a few bugs for cyphermox :)

 16:02:37 <stgraber> - Updated isc-dhcp to 4.1-ESV-R4 that's their Extended Support Version, did a call for testing and will upload it later today.

 16:02:40 <stgraber> - Friendly-Recovery

 16:02:43 <stgraber> - Implemented the 'system information' option and did a few more bugfixes. James proposed some good changes, will review the merge and ask for a FFe to get that added.

 16:02:46 <stgraber> - LTSP

 16:02:49 <stgraber> - Released LTSP 5.3 after two years of development (well, 729 days so not "exactly"), uploaded to Ubuntu. 5.3.1 has already been released as bugfix release but I'll probably wait till 5.3.2 to update Ubuntu.

 16:02:53 <stgraber> - Still some work on the udeb needed to finally kill bug 813837

 16:02:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 813837 in ltsp (Ubuntu Precise) "ltsp client not able to load boot file: ltsp/amd64.tmp/pxelinux.0" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/813837

 16:02:55 <stgraber> - TPM

 16:02:58 <stgraber> - Got pretty close to having a working TPM authenticating on wireless, everything seems to work except for some broken pkcs11 output and problems using the private key...

 16:03:01 <stgraber> - Started looking at bug 934799, can probably be fixed by manually trigger the udev rule or doing the chown/chmod in the postinst

 16:03:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 934799 in trousers (Ubuntu) "trousers start script has exit status 137" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/934799

 16:03:04 <stgraber> - Also bug 926305 is high on the TPM todo list

 16:03:06 <stgraber> - Installer

 16:03:09 <stgraber> - Merged a couple of fixes in Ubiquity, updated test suite and uploaded a new Ubiquity, will spend a lot more time working on installer bugs from now on.

 16:03:12 <stgraber> - Containers

 16:03:14 <stgraber> - Uploaded updated udev to avoid flooding the host with events when a container boots.

 16:03:17 <stgraber> - Some bugfixes for the Ubuntu template and review of the Ubuntu server guide's section on LXC.

 16:03:20 <stgraber> - Other

 16:03:23 <stgraber> - pastebinit 1.3 has now been released and is in Precise

 16:03:25 <stgraber> - Did quite a few last minute sponsoring of new packages for Precise, most of them are in source NEW

 16:08:58 <slangasek> ev:

 16:09:42 <ev> - Released some new versions of whoopsie (0.1.8, 0.1.9, and 0.1.10).

 16:09:42 <ev> - Don't start the crash reporting daemon if crash reporting is turned off.

 16:09:44 <ev> - Cleaned up of the core processing code and much of the backend code, in

 16:09:45 <ev> preparation for deployment.

 16:09:47 <ev> - Filed RT 51011 for deploying the crash database.  Had a catch up with James

 16:09:48 <ev> to discuss where things stand.

 16:09:49 <ev> - Started leveraging cloud-init to build out an end to end system testing

 16:09:51 <ev> framework, so we can ensure that every change works all the way down to the

 16:09:51 <ev> database.

 16:09:53 <ev> - Figured out, with help from #bzr, how to merge a subdirectory of a branch

 16:09:54 <ev> into a subdirectory of another branch without losing history.  Case in

 16:09:56 <ev> point, moving Whoopsie's GNOME Control Center preferences page into

 16:09:57 <ev> activity-log-manager:

 16:09:58 <ev> bzr fast-export /tmp/whoopsie-export

 16:09:59 <ev> bzr fast-import-filter -i preferences/ /tmp/whoopsie-export > /tmp/whoopsie-export-filter

 16:10:09 <ev> bzr mv diagnostics src/diagnostics

 16:10:10 <ev> bzr commit

 16:10:11 <ev> - Moved the crash reporting preferences page from a separate page into a tab

 16:10:13 <ev> in the activity-log-manager page:

 16:10:14 <ev> https://code.launchpad.net/~ev/activity-log-manager/whoopsie/+merge/93899

 16:10:16 <ev> - Finally finished addressing all of Martin's concerns in my apport merge,

 16:10:17 <ev> after lots of subsequent fixes \o/:

 16:10:19 <ev> https://code.launchpad.net/~ev/apport/whoopsie/+merge/92753

 16:10:20 <ev> - Interview calls.

 16:10:21 <ev> (done!)

 16:10:34 <doko> surprisingly short today ...

 16:10:40 <barry> ev: you should write that up somewhere more permanent than irc :)

 16:10:58 <doko> - openjdk-7 build, currently building in precise

 16:10:59 <doko> - fixing and forwarding issues in openjdk7 and -web to IcedTea

 16:10:59 <doko> - openjdk6 pull from the branch to fix GC issues on ARM

 16:10:59 <doko> - eglibc fixes (gdm restart, ARM dbg package, reboot required)

 16:11:07 <doko> done

 16:11:24 <ev> barry: :)

 16:12:07 <slangasek> are the apport UI changes landed, then? I noticed my last crash had a different dialog

 16:13:18 <ev> yes, finally

 16:13:22 <slangasek> * short week, celebrated Pr√©sident Day on Monday by eating camembert and butter

 16:13:25 <slangasek> * resolvconf upload fixing the last of the known issues

 16:13:28 <slangasek> * new upstream release of qemu-linaro uploaded; now usable as a buildd on a hardy kernel

 16:13:34 <slangasek> * work on getting upstart in Ubuntu into a usable state

 16:13:36 <slangasek> * interviewing

 16:13:39 <slangasek> done

 16:13:41 <slangasek> any questions?

 16:14:06 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:14:46 <doko> Andreas Moog did file the ftbfs issues from the last test rebuild, so I hadn't to do it

 16:14:54 <bdmurray> Not too many to look at today

 16:15:16 <slangasek> good, I gorged myself on bugs yesterday at Mardi Gras anyway

 16:15:16 <bdmurray> I assigned bug 883618 to the team recently

 16:15:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 883618 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Console upgrade useless.. XSet warnings all over the screen" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/883618

 16:15:19 <doko> would be nice if somebody could approve the setting of the precice release branch

 16:15:30 <slangasek> doko: what do you mean?

 16:15:45 <barry> slangasek: ew

 16:15:59 <slangasek> barry: ;)

 16:16:09 <slangasek> bdmurray: yeah, I was just assigning that one to jodh

 16:16:19 <barry> slangasek: and right before lunch!

 16:16:27 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay, great

 16:16:27 <slangasek> heh, sorry

 16:16:34 <barry> :)

 16:16:47 <slangasek> fwiw I didn't see any references to xset in the current update-manager code, so I'm not sure where that comes from

 16:16:48 <doko> hmm, looks like it already is: see bug 935038

 16:16:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 935038 in ball (Ubuntu Precise) "ball version 1.4.1+20111206-3 FTBFS on armhf in precise" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/935038

 16:17:06 <doko> we just need to confirm these

 16:17:30 <slangasek> doko: as in, marking them confirmed?

 16:17:36 <doko> yes

 16:18:12 <slangasek> I'm not sure that matters anymore, now that LP automatically moves half the bugs to "confirmed" as soon as someone comments on them

 16:18:22 <doko> heh

 16:18:36 <bdmurray> comments on? that's a bit unfair

 16:18:57 <bdmurray> its even easier you just have to click affects me too ;-)

 16:18:58 <doko> so now we ignore bugs in state Confirmed instead if New? ;-P

 16:19:04 <doko> of even

 16:19:13 <slangasek> "triaged" maybe makes a difference; but they should be obvious anyway... don't see the point in spending the effort moving the bug state around

 16:19:18 <slangasek> let's just fix the bugs instead :)

 16:19:27 <slangasek> doko: exactly ;)

 16:20:01 <doko> slangasek, makes sense, thare are more to ignore ;)

 16:20:06 <slangasek> bdmurray: doesn't it also do it when someone comments though?  which is much less certain to indicate that it's a confirmed bug

 16:20:11 <doko> can't type today

 16:20:17 <slangasek> bdmurray: anyway, any other bugs in the menagerie?

 16:20:33 <bdmurray> slangasek: no affects me too or a bug is made a duplicate of it

 16:20:40 <slangasek> ah, ok

 16:20:46 <bdmurray> bug 936761 - is there anything to be done there?

 16:20:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 936761 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Mythbuntu upgrade from Lucid to Precise pulls in all of unity" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/936761

 16:21:38 <slangasek> looks like the desktop team needs to fix it

 16:22:08 <slangasek> reassigned the bug to gnome-session

 16:22:28 <bdmurray> thanks

 16:23:03 <bdmurray> then bug 824708 has a rather high heat as a lot of people have said it affects them

 16:23:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 824708 in aptitude (Ubuntu) "Changelog download failed: Download queue destroyed." [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/824708

 16:23:26 <stgraber> slangasek: I've noticed Xubuntu and Mythbuntu at some point started assuming that they always get installed from a media where they contorl the available set of packages, not sure if it's related though.

 16:24:05 <slangasek> stgraber: sorta-related

 16:24:11 <slangasek> the moral of the story is, they shouldn't do that :)

 16:24:14 <stgraber> slangasek: so for example installing Xubuntu from netinstall will get you unity-greeter that will crash at boot time. Installing from media, they don't have unity-greeter and so fallback to lightdm-gtk-greeter which is what they want and so works

 16:24:46 <stgraber> that's currently making the automated upgrades for at least Xubuntu fail (so I turned them off for now as they're aware of the issue)

 16:24:48 <slangasek> they should ensure there are suitable alternatives in the underlying dependencies and use a metapackage to express their preferences

 16:25:34 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you know why pitti has set a milestone for 824708?

 16:25:45 <doko> bug 824708

 16:25:46 <bdmurray> slangasek: no I do not

 16:25:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 824708 in aptitude (Ubuntu) "Changelog download failed: Download queue destroyed." [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/824708

 16:26:02 <slangasek> oh, he was just pushing an a2 milestone forward

 16:26:21 <slangasek> so it has high heat, but I don't think it's something for us to spend time on

 16:26:30 <slangasek> they can just use 'apt-get changelog' instead

 16:27:08 <slangasek> (and aptitude has much more serious problems in precise, since it doesn't do multiarch)

 16:27:34 <bdmurray> okay, makes sense

 16:28:12 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:28:25 <bdmurray> that's all from me

 16:28:29 <slangasek> cool

 16:28:31 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:29:10 <slangasek> anything more to discuss?  the floor's open :)

 16:29:51 <doko> the armel panda buildds did land

 16:30:08 <doko> but not yet the third powerpc

 16:30:21 <slangasek> I've pestered IS about the powerpc already

 16:30:28 <slangasek> the RT ticket has a deadline of Mar 1

 16:30:40 <slangasek> which I'm told gets looked at :)

 16:31:24 <slangasek> (and there's activity on the ticket in the past week)

 16:33:15 <slangasek> #endmeeting
