 16:13:58 <arosales> how are folks doing with getting work items documented?

 16:14:07 * rbasak hasn't started yet :-/

 16:14:10 <rbasak> It's on my todo list

 16:14:20 * m_3 too

 16:14:31 <arosales> The release team would like to start setting topics and tread lines by tomorrow

 16:14:32 <roaksoax> we also need to update the above link as they quantal BP's are not yet listed

 16:14:39 <Daviey> So.. Started going through the ones with myself as approver... and they are taking good shape.

 16:14:46 <Daviey> Still needs a little more detail on some.

 16:14:47 <smoser> that url above should probably have been http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:14:55 <hallyn> Daviey: note the user-ns and device-ns ones are not yet approved

 16:14:57 <roaksoax> ah daa

 16:15:02 <arosales> The list I am looking at for q for server

 16:15:03 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+specs?role=drafter

 16:15:39 <arosales> at least for blueprints we need to get work items on, prioritize, and approve for work this cycle

 16:15:43 <Daviey> The links i supplied in last weeks meeting are probably of use.

 16:16:01 <roaksoax> ok, so all of us should finish writing our BP's, make sure the WI are docmented so that they can get approved and we can start working on them

 16:16:04 <Daviey> http://ubuntuserver.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/server-team-20120522-meeting-minutes/

 16:16:08 <Daviey> Read Quantal Development

 16:16:54 <roaksoax> Specs currently under consideration are at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+specs?role=drafter. If a spec is missing, let Daviey know.

 16:17:10 <roaksoax> Blueprints which $user is responsible for driving to Approved state can be found at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~$user/+specs?searchtext=servercloud-q&role=assignee. Please set those which require review to Review state.

 16:17:22 <arosales> So is EOD wednesday too soon to have the blueprints ready for approval?

 16:17:55 <Daviey> Hmm

 16:17:58 <rbasak> Daviey: can we please get the typo fixed on ubuntuserver.wordpress.com? It's embarrassing. I don't want to be associated with that site!

 16:18:25 <Daviey> rbasak: Do you want to drive it's migration to ubuntuserver.org, canonical hosted?

 16:19:04 <Daviey> So.. Lets re-cap of the process...

 16:19:15 <arosales> Thursday an better for folks completing blueprint work item documentation?

 16:19:22 <Daviey> When you think your spec is ready for review, please mark them 'Review'

 16:20:07 <Daviey> arosales & myself with significant help from jamespage and smoser will either give feedback, or Approve

 16:20:44 <Daviey> So.. We can start that ASAP.. so please get your blueprints into a state where you can mark them Review ASAP, and we can start getting them rolled out

 16:20:48 <Daviey> Sound good?

 16:21:42 <roaksoax> [ACTION] To finish BP documentation and mark them Review

 16:21:42 * meetingology To finish BP documentation and mark them Review

 16:22:05 <Daviey> (ASAP :)

 16:22:10 <roaksoax> so I guess the silence means all of us agree

 16:22:14 <roaksoax> [ACTION] To finish BP documentation and mark them Review ASAP!

 16:22:14 * meetingology To finish BP documentation and mark them Review ASAP!

 16:22:15 <zul> suuuure :)

 16:22:25 <roaksoax> ok, let's move on

 16:22:30 <arosales> it would be nice for trend line setting, and tracking if we could have the bulk of work item documentation this competed by this week :-)

 16:22:49 <roaksoax> indeed!

 16:23:00 <roaksoax> alright, so we also have merges to take care of

 16:23:10 <roaksoax> [LINK] http://people.canonical.com/~davewalker/delta.html

 16:23:25 <roaksoax> LINK: http://people.canonical.com/~davewalker/delta.html

 16:24:03 <roaksoax> anyone else has anything to discuss?

 16:24:05 <Daviey> Please feel free to open sync/merge bugs to track assignment. :)

 16:24:09 <Daviey> ^ optional

 16:24:46 <roaksoax> ok, so there doesn't seem to be anything else. Let's move on then

 16:24:55 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:25:10 <roaksoax> any event where we will be particupating that's coming soon?

 16:26:24 <roaksoax> I guess there isn't

 16:26:38 <roaksoax> moving on

 16:26:40 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:26:42 <roaksoax> hggdh: o/

 16:27:27 <roaksoax> uhmm it seems that hggdh is not around, so let;s come back t him later

 16:27:40 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:27:44 <roaksoax> smb: o/

 16:27:49 <smb> yessir! :)

 16:27:53 <smb> Beside of other pieces here and there, a quick test on the libvirt merge and most time spent on trying to reproduce bug 999755 without having a simple test case. This was unsuccessful but since someone posted exactly what was their reproducer I could confirm this to be no problem restricted to VMs. So now I can try out some variations locally.

 16:27:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 999755 in linux (Ubuntu) "Kernel crash in rb_next doing ohai loops" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/999755

 16:27:57 <smb> ..

 16:28:45 <roaksoax> awesome

 16:28:54 <roaksoax> smb: anything else you'd like us to be aware of?

 16:29:15 <Daviey> smb: Anything on the xen front?

 16:29:18 <smb> smoser, and utlemming are already away of -virtual going away

 16:29:29 <Daviey> going away?

 16:29:30 <smb> away -> aware

 16:29:36 <Daviey> Where is this documented ?

 16:29:47 <rbasak> It was mentioned at UDS IIRC

 16:30:01 <smb> Should be somewhere in the uds flavours track

 16:30:16 <smoser> we were aware.

 16:30:20 <Daviey> That should probably be documented somewhere more expressive

 16:30:20 <smoser> but that didn't stop it from breaking things./

 16:30:37 <smoser> smb spoke to me about it.

 16:30:57 <smb> Daviey, where would such a place be?

 16:31:07 <Daviey> smoser: so it's your fault i didn't know?  noted. :)

 16:31:08 <utlemming> On our side, it is being tracked as Bug #1005551

 16:31:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1005551 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "Quantal does not boot on EC2" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1005551

 16:31:18 <Daviey> smb: probably -server ML

 16:31:31 <smoser> well, probably -devel actually.

 16:31:37 <smoser> its not just -server

 16:31:39 <rbasak> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/hardware-q-kernel-version-and-flavors

 16:31:58 <smb> OK, I can check and send out a specific "warning" about that

 16:32:02 <utlemming> I'm working on cleaning up the fallout for the build process, but it will require packaing changes and build process changes.

 16:32:23 <Daviey> smb: thanks!

 16:32:41 <Daviey> utlemming: if it's significant, better track it on a blueprint :)

 16:33:22 <utlemming> Daviey: ack

 16:33:45 <roaksoax> alright, should that be all, let's move on

 16:34:31 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:34:33 <roaksoax> rbasak: o/
