 16:02:18 <hallyn> jamespage: over to you :)

 16:02:37 <jamespage> ta

 16:03:00 <hallyn> hm

 16:03:05 <jamespage> I had a review earlier today - a few to focus in on

 16:03:20 <jamespage> utlemming,

 16:03:32 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-images

 16:03:32 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-awstools

 16:03:59 <jamespage> just a checkin to make sure you are comfortable/on track with those two

 16:04:18 <utlemming> yeah, one of the first, the motu's don'

 16:04:18 <jamespage> smoser, utlemming:

 16:04:18 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils

 16:04:39 <utlemming> want everything in debian, and there is a freeze in place

 16:05:35 <jamespage> utlemming, I'm sure kamal can get some new packages into unstable for you :-)

 16:05:35 <utlemming> on the cloud-image roundtable, that should be okay

 16:05:42 <smoser> jamespage, well, they're clearly behind and i'm sure some things will be postponed.

 16:06:10 <jamespage> Ursinha:

 16:06:10 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:06:35 <jamespage> we still need to catchup on that one - are you going to have some time for report updates etc?

 16:07:02 <jamespage> m_3, jimbaker:

 16:07:02 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:07:19 <jamespage> lots of stuff in progress - all OK?

 16:07:46 <jimbaker> jamespage, yes, we should be getting this connected up this week

 16:07:52 <Ursinha> jamespage, I've been working on reports, I need to catch up with you later

 16:07:56 <jamespage> jimbaker, great!

 16:08:00 <jamespage> Ursinha, fantastic

 16:08:07 <jamespage> sounds like things are moving along

 16:08:24 <jimbaker> i have the first goaround in terms of running manually with a nice DSL in bash

 16:08:43 <jimbaker> then hook up to m_3's charmtester charm

 16:08:53 <jamespage> remember feature freeze is on the 23 august (~2 weeks) - so any new stuff targetting main ideally needs to be in archive by then

 16:09:08 <jamespage> otherwise you have to beg for feature freeze exceptions....

 16:09:23 <jimbaker> jamespage, that's been my fate in the past on the juju project :)

 16:09:39 <jimbaker> but time to squeeze it all in!

 16:09:44 <jamespage> \o/ - great

 16:10:18 <jamespage> so keep on updating blueprints as you complete stuff - helps keep overall track on progress

 16:10:22 <jamespage> so - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:10:25 <jamespage> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:10:37 <jamespage> hallyn, bot does not like me for some reason

 16:10:48 <jimbaker> jamespage, cool, m_3 and i were discussing this very stuff yesterday re blueprint updating

 16:10:54 <hallyn> jamespage: link didn't work for me either

 16:11:02 <hallyn> #LINK http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:11:06 <hallyn> [LINK] http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:11:09 <hallyn> <shrug>

 16:11:38 <jamespage> OK - so zul and adam_g have a few bugs in quantum and horizon in hand

 16:11:54 <zul> to say the least

 16:11:58 <hallyn> uh, MIR for netcf is not on the list

 16:11:59 <jamespage> we still need a volunteer to look at bug 844995

 16:12:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 844995 in python-couchdb (Ubuntu) "Drop support for couchdb related packages" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/844995

 16:12:39 <jamespage> any takers?

 16:13:05 <jamespage> (I'll sponsor it if someone wanted to have a first stab at some packaging updates...)

 16:13:29 <jamespage> hallyn, netcf - I'll need to subscribe ubuntu-server to the package for bugs - then it will appear

 16:13:38 <jamespage> looks like we have *alot* of MIR's in flight

 16:13:43 <hallyn> jamespage: great, thanks

 16:14:15 <jamespage> hallyn, done

 16:14:31 <hallyn> \o/  we'll wnat that anyway

 16:15:10 <jamespage> if you are raising MIR's please can you set a priority on the bug reports; at a minimum it helps prioritize focus for the MIR team

 16:15:49 <jamespage> should probably reflect the priority of the associated blueprint - remember you can link bugs to blueprints as well so they can be tracked on status.ubuntu.com

 16:16:55 <jamespage> any other quantal dev stuff anyone wants to raise?

 16:17:06 <hallyn> (i'll wait until smb's section :)

 16:17:18 <jamespage> hallyn, I think thats me done then

 16:17:24 <hallyn> thanks!

 16:17:27 * smb shudders

 16:17:27 <hallyn> #topic 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:17:36 <hallyn> uh, and straight back to you? :)

 16:17:47 <jamespage> unless smoser wants the spot :-)

 16:17:54 <hallyn> smoser: \o

 16:17:58 <smoser> hey

 16:18:07 <smoser> so. basically the target for 12.04.1 is thursday

 16:18:15 <rbasak> o/

 16:18:25 <smoser> if you're not going to have something in by then, then you should really consider it not in for 12.04.1 and retarget anything to -updates.

 16:18:45 <smoser> thats my general comment

 16:18:47 <hallyn> and http://people.canonical.com/~jamespage/server-sru/precise-sru.html is the definitive list?

 16:18:57 <jamespage> yeah - thats a good source

 16:19:06 * jamespage must get the integrated somewhere more formal

 16:19:11 <smoser> do you have anything specific, jamespage ?

 16:19:37 <jamespage> we need to nudge walinuxagent forwards but aside from that I think we are in an OK place

 16:21:26 <hallyn> moving along then,

 16:21:34 <hallyn> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21:45 <hallyn> i assume quite a few people going to plumber's and associated events?

 16:22:06 <hallyn> or not :)

 16:22:16 <hallyn> any other events to mention?

 16:22:30 <hallyn> moving along,

 16:22:34 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:22:42 <hallyn> hey hggdh

 16:23:23 <smoser> hallyn, are you going to plumbers?

 16:23:29 <hallyn> smoser: i am not :(

 16:23:38 * smb is

 16:24:04 <hallyn> no hggdh , moving along

 16:24:08 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:24:09 <hallyn> hey smb

 16:24:14 <smb> hey hallyn

 16:24:18 <smb> So wassup?

 16:24:26 <jimbaker> i am presenting juju at 3 separate events around boulder in the next 3 months: boulder lug, big data meetup (focused on zookeeper and how we use it, along w/ hadoop, etc), and the national center for atmospheric research

 16:24:26 <hallyn> my q was on bug 1031090

 16:24:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1031090 in linux (Ubuntu) "kvm_intel not loadable in a quantal guest" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1031090

 16:24:43 <hallyn> is the fix for that known, or are you just saying "when someone whips up a fix we'll take it"?

 16:24:43 <smb> Not much to bring up specifically. The failure to load the kvm intel module is in progress. The upstream discussion is/was mostly on how/where to fix it (the right way). But rather will need to go into precise.

 16:25:02 <hallyn> but precise is on 3.2 i thought?

 16:25:03 * smb notes he was about to say something about tit

 16:25:29 <smb> hallyn, Right, the problem is that loading the modules checks a msr for a feature which any real cpu would have

 16:25:31 <hallyn> (jimbaker is a travelin' fool)

 16:25:47 <hallyn> smb: right but i thought one comment said it was introduced in 3.3

 16:25:51 <smb> but the older kvm modules did not set it for the nested case

 16:26:15 <smb> hallyn, Introduced yes as in adding the support for that feature

 16:26:34 <smb> but upstream thinks rather than handling the non-presence (which should not happen) in newer coder

 16:26:36 <hallyn> ah

 16:26:36 <smb> *code

 16:26:44 <smb> the old code should add it

 16:27:09 <smb> And I think 3.2 is about the only kernel that supports nesting and misses it

 16:27:20 <hallyn> we were never at war with eurasia, and that bug was never there

 16:27:21 <smb> Could be wrong though, then it needs backport to before

 16:28:06 <hallyn> smb: if we were to add itot the old code, is it simple to do?  should we just do it to hit 12.04.1?

 16:28:30 <hallyn> eh, let's discuss in -server after the meeting?

 16:28:47 <smb> hallyn, ok, it would be simplish (hopefully safe)

 16:28:54 <hallyn> great, thanks

 16:28:55 <smb> hallyn, but yeah, lets move this on

 16:28:57 <hallyn> any other questions for smb?

 16:29:12 <hallyn> from smb? :)

 16:29:29 <smb> nothing mmore

 16:29:37 <hallyn> thanks smb.  moving on,

 16:29:40 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:29:41 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:30:06 <jimbaker> rbasak, i assume good outcome of the java mtg i missed when i was on vac?

 16:30:26 <rbasak> Yeah I think so

 16:30:29 * rbasak tries to remember

 16:30:40 <rbasak> I think jamespage was more involved in that than I was

 16:30:58 <jamespage> jimbaker, ok-ish

 16:31:10 <jimbaker> no worries, i *might* have some insight on any java issues

 16:31:12 <jamespage> still no java 7 JVM implementation - soon!

 16:32:13 <hallyn> moving on?

 16:32:19 <jimbaker> so there are good results posted on the openjdk for java 7 on arm. anyway, i'll need to get onto arm hw soon enough for the testing doing w/ m_3

 16:32:21 <jimbaker> so look then too

 16:33:13 <hallyn> any bounds on 'soon enough'?

 16:34:02 <jamespage> hallyn, not really - it has focus upstream but the invoke-dynamic stuff is proving complex to implement

 16:34:12 <hallyn> ok

 16:34:25 <hallyn> #topic Open Discussion

 16:35:28 <jamespage> I have one for next week - I invited gema from the QA team to come and give us an overview of whats happing in QA this cycle

 16:35:40 <hallyn> cool

 16:35:53 <jamespage> specifically the new testing framework (UTAH) and how we can get more involved with test cases etc...

 16:36:03 <hallyn> yup, i still need to do that for lxc testcases

 16:36:17 <hallyn> (this might nudge me along)

 16:36:36 <hallyn> anything else?

 16:36:43 <hallyn> going twice,

 16:36:56 <hallyn> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:37:12 <hallyn> Tuesday Aug 14, same time as always

 16:37:16 <hallyn> thanks everyone
