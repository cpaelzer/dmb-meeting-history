 18:02:29 <bdmurray> #topic Previous Actions

 18:03:01 <bdmurray> earlier we had talked about compiling a list of DBus.Error.NoReply bug reports and looking at their status, importance and gravity

 18:03:13 <bdmurray> before deciding how to tackle them

 18:03:15 <Ursinha> I 'm working on it right now

 18:03:17 <bdmurray> I've created such a list

 18:03:27 <Ursinha> cool!

 18:03:29 <bdmurray> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/834211/

 18:04:19 <bdmurray> the search_text parameter for the API wasn't a huge help so I just looked at all the apport crashes

 18:04:36 <Ursinha> regardless the package?

 18:04:47 <bdmurray> Ursinha: right ;-)

 18:05:55 <Ursinha> I thought there would be more of them

 18:06:11 <bdmurray> well apport did a lot of duplicating on a per package basis

 18:06:16 <Ursinha> bdmurray, the way you said when we discussed that, I thought there were hundreds

 18:06:17 <Ursinha> hmm

 18:06:29 <yofel> o/

 18:07:01 <Ursinha> bdmurray, how long it takes for that script to run?

 18:07:06 <bdmurray> bug 437883

 18:07:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 437883 in blueman (Ubuntu Precise) "blueman-applet crashed with DBusException in call_blocking()" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/437883

 18:07:19 <Ursinha> can we add titles and such to be easier to have an idea?

 18:08:07 <bdmurray> actually that one isn't a perfect example but gives you an idea of how apport would mark duplicates about one package

 18:08:12 <bdmurray> yofel: yes?

 18:08:18 <bdmurray> Ursinha: sure

 18:08:27 <yofel> just idling around as I haven't been there for a while

 18:09:07 <bdmurray> bug 707990 is a better example

 18:09:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 707990 in aptdaemon (Ubuntu) "update-manager crashed with DBusException in _convert_dbus_exception(): org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken." [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/707990

 18:09:28 <bdmurray> Ursinha: so what would you like to see really?

 18:09:52 <Ursinha> bdmurray, I don't know, maybe the title/package along with the bug#

 18:10:15 <bdmurray> okay

 18:10:46 <bdmurray> #action bdmurray to improve list of dbus error no reply bugs

 18:10:46 * meetingology bdmurray to improve list of dbus error no reply bugs

 18:11:05 <bdmurray> #topic Engineering Team Bug Status

 18:11:13 <bdmurray> Ursinha: do you have anything for us?

 18:11:45 <Ursinha> nothing specific; I've been working on a bug list sorted by "gravity", will have something to show next meeting

 18:12:20 <bdmurray> great

 18:12:29 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: anything on your side?

 18:12:55 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, nothing specific as well.  I've bee focused on bisecting and building test kernels for precise bugs.

 18:13:01 <jsalisbury> s/bee/been/

 18:13:16 <Ursinha> jsalisbury, there is a bug I've been hitting lately, not sure it's something important

 18:13:26 <Ursinha> (not sure this is the place to discuss as well :))

 18:13:43 <Ursinha> I have a nfs mount that causes ls to hang

 18:13:56 <Ursinha> I found a kernel bug today that mentions the problem in natty, and in older kernels

 18:14:12 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, hmm, interesting.  maybe open a bug and I can take a deeper look.

 18:14:14 <bdmurray> how about we talk about it towards the end?

 18:14:20 <Ursinha> sure

 18:14:51 <bdmurray> I've been lookingat lots of ubiquity bugs the past week

 18:15:29 <bdmurray> and have come up with a tagging scheme to identify parts of the installer where people saw the bug

 18:15:36 <bdmurray> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingUbiquity

 18:15:46 <bdmurray> in the notes at the end (rather rough yet)

 18:16:29 <Ursinha> cool

 18:16:56 <bdmurray> and as a public service announcement you might encounter a bug when installing from alpha 2 with flashplugin-installer, if you choose the restricted software option

 18:17:05 <bdmurray> that's being investigated

 18:17:45 <bdmurray> Lots of bug patterns being merged from Vadim Rutkovsky too

 18:18:13 <Ursinha> that bug that crashes the installation?

 18:18:14 <bdmurray> Those have actually brought up some old bugs too which has been helpful

 18:18:26 <bdmurray> Ursinha: yes

 18:18:50 <Ursinha> bdmurray, that's an old bug, isn't it? problem with network manager not being able to resolve the names and flash failing to download...

 18:19:18 <bdmurray> Ursinha: yes, its come back and may have something to do with the new name resolution bits

 18:19:27 <Ursinha> right

 18:20:31 <bdmurray> the installer crashing in this case is bug 876298

 18:20:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 876298 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "[MASTER] We need to better handle external payloads (Flash, msttcorefonts) not being available." [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/876298

 18:20:55 <bdmurray> anyway thats it from me

 18:21:43 <bdmurray> #topic Bug Escalations (any High or Critical bugs that community members have seen that need attention)

 18:21:59 <bdmurray> yofel: do you have anything?

 18:22:13 <yofel> nope

 18:22:54 <bdmurray> anybody?

 18:22:56 <bil21al> bdmurray:  for your information from my side all the high and critical bugs of empathy are in progress

 18:23:09 <bdmurray> bil21al: that's great

 18:23:19 <bil21al> hm

 18:24:28 <bdmurray> next topic then

 18:24:35 <bdmurray> #topci other topics

 18:24:41 <bdmurray> #topic other topics

 18:24:48 <bdmurray> is there anything else to discuss?

 18:25:01 <Ursinha> can I show that bug to jsalisbury? :)

 18:25:06 <bdmurray> sure!

 18:25:17 <Ursinha> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/760744

 18:25:18 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 760744 in linux (Ubuntu) "NFS mount hangs ls and nautilus" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 18:25:36 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, looking

 18:25:55 <yofel> is a symlink in that folder? I've had apps hang on an ioctl() when the nfs mount was hung while looking up the link

 18:26:08 <Ursinha> jsalisbury, so, I'm not sure what to change in that bug to add that I'm having a problem with 3.0.0 in oneiric

 18:26:19 <Ursinha> yofel, mine isn't

 18:27:25 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, you could open a separate bug, we can investigate and mark as a duplicate if it is in fact a duplicate.

 18:27:35 <Ursinha> sure, thanks jsalisbury

 18:27:49 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, np.  sometimes this could be an NFS client issue as well.

 18:28:02 <hggdh> I dimly remember an issue with ' ls --color' and non-accessible mounts

 18:28:08 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, I recall at one point we changed from NFS3 by default to NFS4.

 18:28:14 <yofel> hggdh: that's what I was talking about

 18:28:27 <hggdh> the user should try with 'ls --color=no'

 18:28:30 <Ursinha> hggdh, hm

 18:28:52 <hggdh> this is a known issue, but I am not sure it can be solved nicely

 18:29:02 <hggdh> there are at least one coreutils bug on it

 18:29:07 <Ursinha> by nicely you mean...

 18:29:17 <hggdh> programmatically

 18:29:23 <Ursinha> right

 18:29:44 <hggdh> yofel: indeed :-), sorry

 18:29:47 <Ursinha> I'll file the bug and investigate a bit more, will try the no color trick

 18:29:51 <yofel> heh, np

 18:30:01 <yofel> you were more accurate

 18:30:11 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, can you add the kernel-da-key tag?  That will put it on my hot list.

 18:30:18 <Ursinha> sure jsalisbury

 18:30:24 <jsalisbury> Ursinha, thanks

 18:30:55 <bdmurray> any other business?

 18:31:02 <Ursinha> no, thanks :)

 18:32:09 <yofel> not from me

 18:32:43 <hggdh> jsalisbury: I dimlly recollect this being discussed upstream at coreutils -- my recollection is that this would have to be fixed by the kernel, and the kernel folks did not quite agree

 18:33:31 <jsalisbury> hggdh, thanks for the info.  Was it discussed on LKML?  Or just the coreutils mailing list?

 18:33:35 <hggdh> Ursinha: there are already some bugs on this

 18:33:43 <bdmurray> okay thanks everyone
