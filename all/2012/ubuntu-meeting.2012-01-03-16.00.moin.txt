 16:02:40 <hallyn> eh what?  netcf is packaged.  Fixed the status of that bug

 16:02:44 <rbasak> I can take bug 906735, that seems simple enough

 16:03:14 <Daviey> adam_g: How are the charms looking for openstack?

 16:03:28 <adam_g> Daviey: horizon + keystone submitted to for approval in to the charm store

 16:03:48 <Daviey> SpamapS: are you one of the reviewers? :)

 16:03:54 <m_3> adam_g: gotta tag them with new-charm to hit the review queue

 16:04:10 <adam_g> i submitted them after EOD friday prior to holiday

 16:04:15 <SpamapS> I will definitely review

 16:04:17 <Daviey> jamespage: Are you off rotation from stable now?

 16:04:21 <adam_g> m_3: ah, ill do that

 16:04:25 <jamespage> Daviey: yep!

 16:05:06 <Daviey> jamespage: viable to work on the CI lab this week?

 16:05:19 <jamespage> Daviey: almost certainly

 16:05:23 * SpamapS goes afk to usher family out the door

 16:05:27 <jamespage> (== yes)

 16:05:43 <hallyn> bug 607039 needs module-init-tools love, but i'm not sure how best to do it since we differ from debian

 16:05:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 607039 in nfs-utils (Ubuntu) "NFS4 automount using replicated servers doesn't work" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/607039

 16:06:45 <Daviey> and look for targets for next week, that would rock

 16:06:45 <Daviey> any questions?

 16:06:46 <hallyn> pour some on the intertubes

 16:07:00 <hallyn> 'look for targets for next week'?

 16:07:25 <Daviey> hallyn: Things that are better addressed face-to-face

 16:09:20 <Daviey> ()[D4-5th

 16:09:44 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:10:19 <Daviey> jamespage: have you been closer to this?

 16:10:53 <jamespage> in some areas probably

 16:11:02 <hallyn> ?

 16:11:07 <hallyn> what is 'this'?

 16:11:14 <Daviey> jamespage: how is automated looking?

 16:11:24 <Daviey> (QA and testing)

 16:11:41 <hallyn> ah

 16:11:41 <jamespage> I put a few new ISO install tests live just before Chirstmas; so we now have daily testing of Multi-volume LVM and RAID-1 installs

 16:12:03 <hallyn> neat

 16:12:18 <jamespage> patrickmw has put a new precise dashboard live for the daily testing - https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20ISO%20Testing%20Dashboard/view/Daily/?

 16:12:21 <hggdh> which means we are pretty much complete for ISO testing, I guess

 16:12:29 <Daviey> oooo

 16:12:43 <Daviey> hey hggdh  o/

 16:13:02 <jamespage> you will notice the the precise ec2 images are broken ATM - nice kernel oops

 16:13:37 <hggdh> Daviey: happy new year, etc :-)

 16:13:40 * jamespage digs for the bug

 16:13:48 <Daviey> eeek

 16:14:05 <jamespage> bug 911204

 16:14:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 911204 in linux (Ubuntu) "precise ec2 images fail to boot with kernel oops" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/911204

 16:14:17 <smb> Seems someone upstream managed to break Xen/EC2 guests on Precise by some rtc changes. I believe to understand the problem by now. Need to start discussion.

 16:14:53 <Daviey> \o/

 16:14:57 <jamespage> :-(

 16:15:10 <hggdh> and minimal-virtual still shows about 100M more than it should for installed size... must be something we are adding in on the jenkins test

 16:15:41 <jamespage> hggdh: no - the test takes that into account - amd64 is to large

 16:15:52 <hggdh> jamespage: by 100M?

 16:16:01 <hggdh> er, O(100)

 16:16:05 <jamespage> yes I think so

 16:16:13 <smb> jamespage, I hope to be able to try a patch later on. At least I can see it to some degree on my local system, too.

 16:16:52 <jamespage> Openstack automated testing progress has been slow but hopefully progress in the next few days

 16:17:21 <jamespage> adam_g, zul and I need to catchup as we have all been working on misc pieces of the puzzle

 16:17:30 <adam_g> jamespage: id love to actually pair with you on that now that we can deploy keystone + horizon with the other charms

 16:17:31 <zul> indeed

 16:17:41 <jamespage> +1 to that

 16:18:22 <jamespage> I'll make sure that all of the infrastructure pieces are done this week

 16:18:32 <jamespage> it will make a good target to complete early during the sprint

 16:18:44 <jamespage> thats it from me...

 16:18:54 <hallyn> ok, thanks - moving on

 16:18:59 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:19:17 <Daviey> sm	hey

 16:19:20 <smb> Beside of the new precise breakage... not much to report yet

 16:19:24 <Daviey> I hear the ec2 precise kernel is bad.. :)

 16:19:49 <smb> Just when one does not look for 2 weeks

 16:20:08 <smb> On the other hand the change to make it boot at all came in via upstream. :-P

 16:20:12 <Daviey> bug 902951 ?

 16:20:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 902951 in linux (Ubuntu) "CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK shouldnt be a module" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/902951

 16:20:49 <smb> Probably goes alongside with the problem we have with the xen pv drivers

 16:20:57 <Daviey> zul: ^?

 16:21:31 <zul> Daviey: thats with the amd64 kernel i havent tried it recently

 16:21:35 <smb> While I think that one was already in the installer but needed a special action to load the module

 16:21:55 <Daviey> ahh

 16:22:27 <Daviey> smb: Are you aware how the various ARM kernels are doing?

 16:22:27 <Daviey> rbasak: ^^?

 16:22:38 <smb> Daviey, No

 16:22:46 * rbasak doesn't know

 16:23:08 <Daviey> I'm concerned we'll notice something late in the cycle.

 16:23:40 <rbasak> I've not tried precise on a pandaboard yet but I can stick that in my todo if you like

 16:23:50 <smb> Daviey, Have we committed really there. Given that Xen on arm is just being done

 16:24:01 <hallyn> #action rbasak to try precise on pandaboard

 16:24:01 * meetingology rbasak to try precise on pandaboard

 16:24:30 <Daviey> smb: Not in specific to xen on arm, that is a nice to have / SRU / Universe thing, if possible

 16:24:42 <Daviey> Just general ARM kernel support.

 16:25:04 <Daviey> Last cycle we noticed missi g modules very late

 16:25:55 <smb> Daviey, Ah... Ok, have not noticed anyone shouting at me. But you can ask ppisati maybe

 16:26:06 <Daviey> ok, thanks!

 16:26:14 <Daviey> ..

 16:26:28 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

 16:26:40 <hallyn> (should we swap in rbasak for that?)

 16:27:35 <hallyn> i'll take that as a yes, and ask rbasak: any other arm related news?

 16:27:57 <hallyn> (rbasak: you interface regularly with NCommander?)

 16:28:37 <rbasak> OK, I'll check with NCommander in the weekly ARM meeting, I can swap Daviey for rbasak in their agenda too

 16:29:05 <hallyn> hm, well moving on

 16:29:09 <hallyn> oops

 16:29:35 <hallyn> rbasak: thanks

 16:29:42 <rbasak> No news as far as I'm aware. I'll test precise on a panda this week

 16:30:08 <hallyn> #action hallyn to swap rbasak for NCommander in arm agenda section

 16:30:08 * meetingology hallyn to swap rbasak for NCommander in arm agenda section

 16:30:09 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

 16:31:31 <hallyn> moving on,

 16:31:36 <hallyn> #topic Open Discussion

 16:31:56 <rbasak> bug 858878 - RoAkSoAx, where are we with that?

 16:31:57 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 858878 in cobbler (Ubuntu Oneiric) "lack of csrf protection in cobbler-web" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/858878

 16:32:04 <rbasak> (this is for the SRU rather than Precise)

 16:32:28 <RoAkSoAx> rbasak: so changes were uncommitted as the security process is different, so really there's nothing I can do

 16:32:36 <adam_g> zul: when is the next openstack snapshot going out?

 16:32:44 <RoAkSoAx> rbasak: as it is a security update not an SRU

 16:32:51 <rbasak> OK, so does someone else need to sponsor it?

 16:33:00 <RoAkSoAx> rbasak: uyes someone from the security team

 16:33:00 <zul> adam_g: friday

 16:33:02 <RoAkSoAx> rbasak: I can'

 16:33:02 <rbasak> or are we just waiting on the security team?

 16:33:11 <rbasak> OK I'll poke them, thanks

 16:33:26 <Daviey> rbasak: is there a prepped security update?

 16:33:26 <RoAkSoAx> rbasak: I can't recall who was helping me on that and said that he will push it thru, but then I went on holidays and forgot, sorry :(

 16:33:43 <adam_g> zul: any chance it can roast for a day or two in a PPA first?

 16:33:48 <rbasak> Daviey: yes, except that I need to change the pocket presumably

 16:34:14 <rbasak> Daviey: lp:~racb/ubuntu/oneiric/cobbler/security_201112

 16:34:15 <zul> adam_g: sure i can let it stew in a ppa by thursday

 16:35:08 <adam_g> zul: if you can let it simmer there, that'd be cool. we can boil out any bugs before end of week so we're in good shape in budapest

 16:35:21 <RoAkSoAx> Daviey: rbasak I think its wise to check the security ppa, cause, AFAIK, it was supposed to hit the PPA in order to test, and I was gonna be ping to do so

 16:35:23 <rbasak> ah, the pocket is correct. so just waiting for sponsor/review

 16:35:33 <zul> adam_g: no worries

 16:35:54 <hallyn> all right, moving on,

 16:35:56 <hallyn> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:36:01 <hallyn> none next week i assume, so

 16:36:06 <hallyn> Tuesday, Jan 17 at 16:00 UTC

 16:36:12 <hallyn> thanks, all
