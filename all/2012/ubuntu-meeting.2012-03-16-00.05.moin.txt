 00:06:43 <Pendulum> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for March 15, 2012. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:06:47 <Pendulum> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 00:06:51 <Pendulum> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:06:54 <Pendulum> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:06:58 <Pendulum> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:07:03 <Pendulum> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:07:08 <Pendulum> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 00:07:37 <Pendulum> It looks like caravena isn't here

 00:07:49 <Pendulum> bladernr_: are you here?

 00:07:57 <bladernr_> Yep

 00:08:01 <Pendulum> great!

 00:08:01 <bladernr_> Hi :)

 00:08:15 * hggdh cheers for bladernr_

 00:08:17 <bladernr_> ready?

 00:08:21 <Pendulum> #topic Application of bladernr_ for Membership

 00:08:22 <greg-g> please introduce yourself :)

 00:08:30 <bladernr_> Hi, I'm Jeff.  I've been a linux user since the mid-90s, and ubuntu since 8.04.  I currently do a lot of filing, triaging and resolving bugs that involve Checkbox and subsequently the Ubuntu Friendly program.  I'm also one of the Checkbox developers and write patches and test scripts for that. I focus a lot on testing Ubuntu on server hardware and writing test cases for servers.  I've led several sessions and UDS over

 00:08:30 <bladernr_> the last couple years relating to certificaiton and server interests.  I also like to help out with QA, especially with ISO testing, filing bugs related to that effort and trying to make Ubuntu better for users.  I try to view things from the viewpoint of the first time Linux user when I test.  I tend to stick more to mailing lists than forums just because keeping up with forums can quickly get out of control! I  previ

 00:08:31 <bladernr_> ously taught Intro to Linux at the local Community College as a way to give back to the community, and I always gave my students Ubuntu CDs to use.o/ I'm also a Ham and a member of Ubuntu Hams and doing testing and such with Ubuntu on ARM.

 00:08:37 <bladernr_> Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffLaneyes

 00:08:51 <bladernr_> :)

 00:08:57 <pleia2> "That Guy Who Forced a Respin of Lucid on Release Day" hah! :D

 00:09:16 <bladernr_> that should have been https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffLane sorry for the borked link

 00:09:19 * hggdh remembers this episode

 00:09:38 <pleia2> this past weekend I did my first iso testing *and* bought a laptop partially based off a good score on Ubuntu Friendly :)

 00:09:45 <bladernr_> yay!

 00:10:05 <bladernr_> I like community review sites like that.  I used to live off linux-laptops.net when it was regularly updated.

 00:10:10 <bladernr_> I'm glad people find UF useful

 00:11:22 * skaet appreciates his ISO testing work too. :)

 00:11:47 <bladernr_> skaet, thanks :) it's fun... I like breaking things

 00:11:51 <pleia2> thanks for having such a thorough wiki page!

 00:11:59 <pleia2> I don't really have any questions

 00:12:06 <greg-g> me neither, good wiki page :)

 00:12:21 <greg-g> took me a while to scan it all :)

 00:12:23 <bladernr_> Thangs pleia2, greg-g I usually worry about being too verbose

 00:12:32 <bladernr_> I tend to be set on -vvv

 00:12:37 <pleia2> hehe

 00:12:39 <greg-g> bladernr_: I'm a fan of verbose, I was an Anthropology undergrad ;)

 00:12:59 <greg-g> (which means I read way too many overly verbose explanations of things)

 00:13:34 <Pendulum> okay, I think we're ready to vote now

 00:17:03 <pleia2> welcome bladernr_ :)

 00:17:14 <Pendulum> It looks like fitoschido isn't here

 00:17:18 <Pendulum> skellat: are you here?

 00:17:21 <skellat> Here

 00:17:39 <Pendulum> #topic Stephen Kellat for Membership

 00:17:42 <jrgifford> YAY SKELLAT! :D

 00:17:46 <skellat> Hello, my name is Stephen Michael Kellat and I am the Head Writer at Erie Looking Productions.

 00:17:53 <skellat> I produce the weekly podcast for the Ohio LoCo and try to serve as a resource within the LoCo for experience with more exotic architectures like the SheevaPlug and BeagleBoard.

 00:18:00 <skellat> I am also fairly active on my LoCo's e-mail list and have not had luck with efforts to reinvigorate our forum presence.

 00:18:06 <skellat> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/skellat

 00:18:07 <jrgifford> And he's a active Ohio LoCo guy. :)

 00:18:24 <Unit193> Harder for him as well since he's out in the middle of nowhere.

 00:18:29 <pleia2> skellat: ooh, can I lure you over to doing some Xubuntu ISO testing before our beta2? :)

 00:19:02 <skellat> pleia2: Quite possibly now that I've got a chip I can swap for the current one.  My BeagleBoard is on Xubuntu 11.10 as is.

 00:19:54 <skellat> Unit193: Ashtabula isn't the middle of nowhere.  It's just the extreme outer fringe geographically of the State of Ohio. :-)

 00:20:26 <jrgifford> skellat, Unit193: Same difference ;)

 00:21:03 <skellat> jrgifford: What can I say?  We've got a big state and LoCo members who are very far flung throughout it.

 00:21:03 <Unit193> (Going off member placement map)

 00:21:04 <greg-g> skellat: just wondering why there aren't any testimonials on your wiki? I know Ohio is hard place for people, but.. ;)

 00:21:23 <jrgifford> OH dangit, did I forget to write mine in?! crap.

 00:21:25 <skellat> greg-g: jrgifford and unit193 chose to attend in-person tonight

 00:21:31 * greg-g nods

 00:21:33 <Unit193> Yes it did.

 00:22:21 <Pendulum> skellat: How often does the podcast come out? (there aren't dates on the episodes)

 00:23:00 <skellat> Normally weekly.  There was a death in the family Sunday and my day job had an all-night work event so there isn't an episode for the 12th.

 00:23:24 <jrgifford> consider my presence a testimonial please. :) He's been doing stuff in the loco, is active on the mailing list and is a friendly guy.

 00:23:32 <greg-g> thanks jrgifford :)

 00:23:34 <skellat> When paultag and I first set up the podcast posting form on the team's drupal site we didn't choose to go with dates but instead episode numbers.

 00:23:56 <skellat> Unlike Ubuntu UK's program, we don't have it divided into seasons

 00:24:49 * greg-g nods

 00:25:12 <skellat> Pendulum: We've had multiple calls for feedback from around the state to air.  If I get it, it airs.  With everybody spread out so much it gets a bit hard planning out shows.

 00:27:50 * jokerdino joins the meeting, without much purpose and reason though.

 00:29:04 <Pendulum> okay, we're ready to vote

 00:32:21 <Pendulum> wendar: please introduce yourself

 00:32:31 <wendar> Hi, Allison here. I'm a C and dynamic language (Python, Perl, Ruby, etc) developer. I've been involved in Ubuntu since 2005, and my first UDS was 2006 in Mountain View. I work on packaging, architecture, and healthy relations between volunteers, employees, upstreams, and downstreams.

 00:32:38 <wendar> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AllisonRandal

 00:33:45 <greg-g> wendar: as a side note: Thanks for your cat herding with the Harmony Agreements drafting process :)

 00:33:56 <Pendulum> wendar: I apologize for misspelling your name in the topic just now.

 00:34:00 <ajmitch> it seems to be a common theme that people are surprised that wendar isn't a member already

 00:34:01 <wendar> greg-g: glad to help :)

 00:34:10 <wendar> Pendulum: no worries

 00:34:56 <greg-g> wendar: I don't really have any substantial questions un/fortunately

 00:34:57 <greg-g> :)

 00:35:49 * stgraber waves and highly recommends a +1 for wendar

 00:35:57 <Pendulum> wendar: What's your favourite thing to do outside of your tech work?

 00:36:29 * skaet waves and echoes stgraber's +1  ;)

 00:36:39 <wendar> Pendulum: Hmmm... it's a toss up between watching English mysteries, baking gluten-free tasty treats, and astrophysics.

 00:36:58 * ajmitch has already put his +1 on the wiki :)

 00:37:40 <elky> Baking and astrophysics. I think you just won The Internet.

 00:37:47 <greg-g> hah

 00:37:52 <wendar> elky: heh :)

 00:44:12 <Pendulum> #topic Membership for Vibhav Pant

 00:44:14 <greg-g> (and sorry for the delay)

 00:44:18 <Pendulum> vibhav: please introduce yourself

 00:44:21 <vibhav> ok

 00:44:41 <vibhav> Hi everybody, I am Vibhav Pant, a 14 year old padwan living in Dehradun, India

 00:45:01 <vibhav> I have been using Ubuntu since 6.10, but got the hang of Ubuntu from 7.04

 00:45:22 <stgraber> wendar: congrats

 00:45:43 <vibhav> I have been translating Ubuntu to Hindi for the past 6 months and have recently started traanslation for en_GB

 00:45:51 <vibhav> (but thats simply cupy paste)

 00:45:55 <vibhav> copy*

 00:46:41 <vibhav> I have collaborated with fellow Hindi Translators to start a translation Drive to rectify common translation errors and got massive response

 00:47:15 <vibhav> We are also working on improving the Wiki page and creating a list of replacemnet words for Hindi

 00:47:37 <vibhav> Which can be seen on my Wiki Page

 00:47:42 <vibhav> Apart from Translation

 00:48:16 <vibhav> I fix small few bugs (typos and bugs fixed upstream but not brought into Ubuntu)

 00:49:03 <vibhav> I also work on "Needs Packaging" and RFP bugs in Ubuntu\Debian and often package software that seems interesting to me

 00:49:14 <vibhav> I have converted 6 friends to Ubuntu

 00:49:38 <vibhav> and 1 of them uses it exclusively

 00:49:49 <pangolin> Is this translation drive documented anywhere?

 00:49:55 <vibhav> Mailing List

 00:50:34 <pangolin> Could you link to it please?

 00:50:56 <vibhav> sure

 00:51:14 <vibhav> lemme see

 00:51:50 <vibhav> https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-l10n-hi/msg0003

 00:51:59 <elky> Well, en -> en translations are more than copy/paste. Trash/Garbage, Color/Colour, etc...

 00:52:05 <vibhav> yes

 00:52:16 <vibhav> I forgot to mention that though

 00:52:19 <greg-g> hmmm, that link doesn't work for me

 00:52:32 <vibhav> https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-l10n-hi/msg00031.html

 00:52:55 <vibhav> I also test pre-release ISOs on Ubuntu for Papercuts and bugs

 00:53:03 <vibhav> And try to fix them if they are easy

 00:53:57 <vibhav> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jM_vGDcBbio7ITwY_Q7JNW15eO5vrzjDWafnjehDns/edit

 00:54:04 <vibhav> ^ are replacement words

 00:54:52 <vibhav> I am currently learning python, which I would use for Ubuntu Development sooner

 00:54:59 <vibhav> I am also working to be a MOTU

 00:55:21 <cyphermox> vibhav: can you tell me more about what you've done for that?

 00:56:06 <cyphermox> for instance, who you've worked with, packages you've touched; very briefly, since we're not really here to give membership based on development work :)

 00:56:22 <vibhav> I know

 00:57:29 <vibhav> I have packaged shc, unity-lens-bliss and indicators which are waiting approval in Debian\REVU

 00:57:47 <vibhav> I am currently working on packaging ecere and sending it to Debian

 00:58:12 <cyphermox> have you worked with anybody on this so far or has it been mostly on your own?

 00:58:25 <vibhav> dholbach

 00:58:30 <vibhav> and tumbleweed

 00:59:27 <cyphermox> good

 00:59:45 <vibhav> But I am focusing more on fixing bugs than translating softwareb :)

 01:01:18 <vibhav> I meant packaging software and not translating it

 01:01:30 <pangolin> vibhav, Why do you want to be an Ubuntu member?

 01:01:47 <vibhav> It feels nice to be recognized memeber of the community

 01:02:04 <Pendulum> vibhav: While we recognize that you've done quite a bit of translations work, if you can wait a little longer, a few months maybe to build up your experience and community work, please come back then. And, of course, if you're planning on going for MOTU that may be a more appropriate path to membership.

 01:03:04 <vibhav> experience in terms of?

 01:03:07 <greg-g> vibhav: if you have any questions about this, please feel free to email Ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com

 01:03:10 <elky> Knowing your limits is kind of important, too. Needing to keep a member banned from #ubuntu to stop them trying to give tech support is really not something we want to have to do.

 01:03:32 <greg-g> that goes to all membership review board members for all regions, just fyi

 01:04:02 <vibhav> But didn't I collaborate (As I was said to do earlier)?

 01:05:13 <greg-g> vibhav: thank you for listening to our advice, but we feel you should wait a while longer and work with people a little more closely. Again, if you have any questions, feel free to email us after the meeting

 01:05:32 <Pendulum> okay, moving on

 01:05:36 <Pendulum> ChrisGagnon: are you here?

 01:05:44 <ChrisGagnon> Pendulum: hi

 01:05:49 <pangolin> vibhav, I am encouraged by your interest in packaging and bug fixing, you sought out the help of great people like dholbach and tumbleweed. i still believe you need to work longer. this is my personal opinion, but I do look forwrd to the day I can attend a meeting and give the board my +1 for your membership. Please keep up the good work.

 01:05:54 <Pendulum> #topic Chris Gagnon for Membership

 01:05:58 <Pendulum> ChrisGagnon: Please introduce yourself

 01:06:18 <ChrisGagnon> ork for Canonical as a QA engineer in the mainstream group.

 01:06:21 <ChrisGagnon> oops

 01:06:27 <ChrisGagnon> I work for Canonical as a QA engineer in the mainstream group.

 01:06:42 <ChrisGagnon> Started using Linux in 1998. My linux progression went from Redhat -> Mandrake -> Gentoo -> Ubuntu. I started using Kubuntu in 2006 and regular Ubuntu starting with 11.04, because I like unity-2d.

 01:06:50 <greg-g> "mainstream"?

 01:07:24 <ChrisGagnon> It's part of the professional services engineering group

 01:07:32 <greg-g> gotcha

 01:07:48 <greg-g> I just thought Ubuntu was already "mainstream" :)

 01:07:57 <ChrisGagnon> hah it is

 01:08:00 <ChrisGagnon> :)

 01:08:20 <greg-g> so, the only one in your loco's irc channel, eh?

 01:08:21 <ChrisGagnon> I don't know how they came up with the name

 01:08:56 <ChrisGagnon> right now, I have people drop by every now and then, but no one is on every day.

 01:09:15 * greg-g nods

 01:09:21 <ChrisGagnon> irc is not popular in NH I think

 01:09:39 <greg-g> is the NH team more active in other venues? (I hope) :)

 01:09:58 <ChrisGagnon> It's been dead for a while and I am trying to revive it

 01:10:23 <greg-g> cool, thanks for doing that

 01:10:26 <ChrisGagnon> I had 8 people at the global jam last month

 01:10:43 <ChrisGagnon> I think I will have more during the precise release party.

 01:10:59 <greg-g> awesome, 8 ain't bad, really
