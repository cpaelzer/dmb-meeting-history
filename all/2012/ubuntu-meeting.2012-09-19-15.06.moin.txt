 15:06:53 <jodh> * misc:

 15:06:53 <jodh> - Out Friday (at LegoLand! Now proud owner of a Lego Stormtrooper

 15:06:53 <jodh> keyring ;-)

 15:06:53 <jodh> - Patch piloting on Monday.

 15:06:56 <jodh> * boot/upstart: stateful-reexec: Lots of progress:

 15:07:00 <jodh> - merged lp:~cjwatson/upstart/stateful-reexec-ptrace.

 15:07:03 <jodh> - Fixed string handling to use JSON null which squashes a number of

 15:07:06 <jodh> bugs.

 15:07:09 <jodh> - Fixed argument handling to avoid any possibility of argument

 15:07:12 <jodh> exhaustion for repeated re-execs.

 15:07:16 <jodh> - Wrote a lot of test support code to allow all serialised object

 15:07:19 <jodh> types to be "diffed".

 15:07:22 <jodh> - Wrote a few basic tests for Session, Process, Event, Log, Job and JobClass.

 15:07:25 <jodh> - Fixed initctl test to avoid sending Upstart SIGTERM (to avoid re-exec! ;-)

 15:07:26 <jodh> - Sent patch to man-pages project for ptrace(2):

 15:07:30 <jodh> http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.man/3163

 15:07:33 <jodh> - Currently finishing a trick Log test.

 15:07:36 <jodh> * Plan:

 15:07:39 <jodh> - Continue to write tests.

 15:07:42 <jodh> - Rework state-passing code to handle failure scenarios better.

 15:07:46 <jodh> - Attempt to add temporary D-Bus connection handling code (until D-Bus

 15:07:49 <jodh> itself offers this facility) and/or tweak bridges to auto-reconnect.

 15:07:52 <jodh> - Build an updated package and put out further call for testers.

 15:07:55 <jodh> ܫ

 15:08:03 <cjwatson> jodh: so I don't think an FFe was ever filed for stateful-reexec - what's the plan regarding stateful-reexec and quantal (is there one?)

 15:08:19 <cjwatson> and if so what do we need to do in the next ~week to get it landed?

 15:20:12 <ogra_> now *that* was short ... this weeks release team summary will be a pleasure :)

 15:20:35 <ev> soz, unicode and adding the submitted crash to the oops ate up a lot of time

 15:20:53 <ev> plus I worked regular hours this week

 15:21:18 <ogra_> scary ?

 15:21:26 <ev> hm?

 15:21:32 <ogra_> how do you manage the trembling hands when not working ?

 15:21:50 <ogra_> (regula hours -> scary)

 15:22:17 <ogra_> (i.e. 8h days)

 15:22:49 <stokachu> damn we're suposed to stop at 8h???

 15:23:04 <ev> oh yes

 15:23:29 <ev> it's tough, but a steady stream of gigs and cosmology talks helps

 15:27:46 <cjwatson> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html is still not entirely unscary though

 15:28:03 <cjwatson> please have a look and take whatever you can of at least the high/critical stuff

 15:28:40 <cjwatson> bdmurray: anything else we should be concerned about?

 15:29:20 <bdmurray> regarding bug 1045201 I had a look at the server images and they have cdromupgrade on them.  where does this need to get fixed?

 15:30:56 <cjwatson> bdmurray: but I didn't want to move it until I'd got it fixed because who knows whether it'll fall off the tracking lists if I do that

 15:35:22 <doko> he did ping Laney and me yesterday

 15:36:28 <ogra_> well, he seemed pretty desparate

 15:37:18 <bdmurray> well, that's all I have for now
