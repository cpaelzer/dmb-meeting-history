 20:02:53 <iainfarrell_> LOL

 20:03:01 * stgraber waves

 20:03:04 <vibhav> ^

 20:03:07 <vibhav> ^^^

 20:03:15 <beuno> iainfarrell_, you seem to be up first!

 20:03:16 <czajkowski> ok let see if we have enough

 20:03:18 * knome waves to stgraber, but very silently

 20:03:22 <iainfarrell_> indeed :)

 20:03:30 <czajkowski> stgraber: Pendulum myself and beuno

 20:03:34 <czajkowski> yup

 20:04:15 <beuno> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/EMEA

 20:04:51 <beuno> iainfarrell_, tell us about yourself!

 20:05:02 <czajkowski> iainfarrell_: welcome, thanks for making it, I know you;ve been on this list now since october! :)

 20:05:04 <iainfarrell_> well beuno and others

 20:05:05 <beuno> #topic iainfarrell's application

 20:05:20 <iainfarrell_> My name's Iain and I've been an Ubuntu user full time I'd say for about 3 years

 20:05:25 <iainfarrell_> and played before that

 20:05:34 <iainfarrell_> as an aside I recently started playing Eve online

 20:05:36 <beuno> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IainFarrell

 20:05:37 <iainfarrell_> and last time I tried it

 20:05:41 <iainfarrell_> it was so hard

 20:05:44 <iainfarrell_> I stopped playing

 20:05:50 <iainfarrell_> and instead installed this new distro

 20:05:54 <iainfarrell_> raved about on Digg

 20:05:56 <iainfarrell_> called Ubuntu :)

 20:06:07 <iainfarrell_> and that's what I love about it, it just works

 20:06:17 <iainfarrell_> and this community is exciting and I want to stay a part of it

 20:06:28 <iainfarrell_> even though I no longer work for Canonical

 20:06:48 <iainfarrell_> as before I want to contribute and mainly in the area of adding photos to our desktop

 20:07:01 <iainfarrell_> and helping contribute to its distinctiveness

 20:07:06 <Pendulum> win 52

 20:07:21 * beuno hugs Pendulum

 20:07:36 <beuno> iainfarrell_, great to still see you around post-Canonical

 20:07:43 <iainfarrell_> I'm also running the wallpaper contributions process at the mo

 20:07:59 <czajkowski> iainfarrell_: can you tell us about the wallpaper and your role in that ?

 20:08:02 <iainfarrell_> we've got over 1000 entries already and it doesn't close until March :)

 20:08:05 <iainfarrell_> yeah

 20:08:11 <iainfarrell_> so about 4 releases ago

 20:08:31 <iainfarrell_> we decided that the community contributions needed a boost and we'd talked at UDS about what could be done

 20:08:48 <iainfarrell_> I decided to see if a small set of beautiful wallpapers could be pulled together

 20:08:58 <iainfarrell_> I felt it would really add

 20:09:10 <iainfarrell_> and it's something that's reasonably straight forward to run

 20:09:20 <iainfarrell_> it's also something that people who aren't technical can contribute to

 20:09:30 <iainfarrell_> because there's a lot of that still today

 20:09:33 <czajkowski> iainfarrell_: great stuff

 20:09:43 <iainfarrell_> I see it on the ubuntu-artwork list and chat rooms all the time

 20:09:48 <czajkowski> iainfarrell_: so how do you see your role in the community going forward?

 20:09:52 <iainfarrell_> and I've run it ever since

 20:09:56 <iainfarrell_> well continue to do that

 20:10:11 <iainfarrell_> I'm also talking to the guys at 500px about pulling together the first of a curated collection

 20:10:22 <iainfarrell_> which would be a gift to the community if you like

 20:10:27 <iainfarrell_> it wouldn't fit on the ISO

 20:10:35 <iainfarrell_> but would be lovely high res images

 20:10:42 <iainfarrell_> which we source from pro photographers

 20:10:46 <iainfarrell_> and we give away

 20:10:58 <iainfarrell_> it promotes us and the very powerful technical and creative tools we offer

 20:11:04 <iainfarrell_> to an audience who've never heard of us

 20:11:09 <iainfarrell_> and are tinkerers by nature

 20:11:18 <iainfarrell_> they think this free tool made by a bunch of us

 20:11:22 <iainfarrell_> who are all over the world

 20:11:27 <iainfarrell_> and barely see each other

 20:11:32 <iainfarrell_> is quite a cool thing

 20:11:49 <iainfarrell_> and that's why I also want to get more involved in DarkTable

 20:11:56 <iainfarrell_> which is a really cool project and you should all check it out

 20:12:06 <iainfarrell_> it's a very very powerful photo editing tool

 20:12:08 <Azzurrio_> cool

 20:12:28 <iainfarrell_> I could go on but then I do that, I'm easily excited :)

 20:12:31 <beuno> cool cool

 20:12:34 <iainfarrell_> so do tell me to stop :)

 20:13:02 <beuno> iainfarrell_, you involved at all the LoCo?

 20:13:33 <t4nk061> hot

 20:13:40 <iainfarrell_> not regularly since I left London, I usually was a conduit for them to get to people in the building for catching up :)

 20:13:54 <iainfarrell_> for example if one was trying to track down Ivanka or Charline or someone

 20:14:10 <iainfarrell_> now I live in the north east too and they're mostly further south

 20:14:23 <iainfarrell_> so I'm not sure where I'd help but I'd be very happy to pitch in

 20:14:42 <iainfarrell_> to be honest, with the move I've not really looked into any groups locally

 20:14:50 <iainfarrell_> it's quite rural where I am now

 20:15:01 <iainfarrell_> but we use Ubuntu at work on all our dev machines

 20:15:04 <iainfarrell_> which is pretty cool :)

 20:15:08 <beuno> indeed!

 20:15:11 <beuno> alright

 20:15:14 <beuno> time to vote

 20:15:16 <iainfarrell_> so I advocate in a professional space

 20:15:23 * iainfarrell_ shuts up :)

 20:18:32 <Katchup> iainfarrell_: congrats

 20:18:42 <beuno> GunnarHj, you around?

 20:19:01 <GunnarHj> Sure. Hi all!

 20:19:11 <beuno> #topic GunnarHj's application

 20:19:20 <beuno> GunnarHj, tell us about yourself!

 20:19:30 <GunnarHj> I'm Gunnar Hjalmarsson, a Swedish fellow living in Gothenburg.

 20:19:32 <GunnarHj> Have used Ubuntu for about 1.5 years, and been involved in (mostly) i18n related patching and bugfixing for almost as long period.

 20:19:34 <GunnarHj> Applied last July, but was turned down (zeroes). Since then I have basically kept doing the same kind of work; the good news is that there are a few testimonials on the wiki page this time.

 20:19:39 <czajkowski> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GunnarHj

 20:19:45 <beuno> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GunnarHj

 20:21:03 <czajkowski> GunnarHj: so mainly in bugs and translations?

 20:21:48 <GunnarHj> Well, not translations exactly. It's more about the interfaces for setting languages etc.

 20:22:19 <GunnarHj> So it's about making the translations easily available to the users.

 20:22:24 <Tm_T> GunnarHj: basicly the work that has to be done so translations can be done?

 20:22:34 <GunnarHj> Yes.

 20:23:05 <czajkowski> GunnarHj: are you involved in other areas in the Ubuntu community, such as your locoteam?

 20:23:38 <GunnarHj> I'm a member of the Swedish team, but haven't yet been active there.

 20:24:04 <czajkowski> so how do you feel Ubuntu membership will help you and the community ? or does it have any effect?

 20:24:08 <GunnarHj> Spent too much time on the dev. stuff, I think.

 20:24:24 <beuno> GunnarHj, a testimonial from pitti is pretty impressice!

 20:24:30 <beuno> and impressive

 20:25:21 <GunnarHj> It would be a showed appreciation of my contribution, and would likely make me more inclined to keep on and entering new areas of contributions.

 20:25:37 <czajkowski> GunnarHj: what other areas would you look at

 20:27:03 <GunnarHj> Can't tell right now. You could say that I have been a driver of certain matters, and right now I'm occupied with ensuring that they make it into 12.04.

 20:27:19 <czajkowski> what are they ?

 20:28:11 <czajkowski> GunnarHj: I'm just trying to ask what areas you'd like to get into in the community

 20:29:08 <GunnarHj> In summary it's about providing bug free user interfaces for changing languages and settings for regional formats. Those things were buggy in 10.04, and we have gradually god rid of most of the bugs.

 20:29:25 <beuno> that's super valuable work

 20:29:28 <beuno> lets vote!

 20:29:32 <beuno> #vote

 20:29:42 <GunnarHj> One thing that has made it more complicated is that the underlying architecture has changed.

 20:29:42 <beuno> +1

 20:30:21 <stgraber> +1

 20:30:32 * beuno slaps meetingology

 20:30:44 <czajkowski> +1 but would like to see other areas explored

 20:31:34 <czajkowski> GunnarHj: congrats

 20:31:37 <GunnarHj> Thanks! It makes me very happy and flattered. :)

 20:31:47 <iainfarrell_> well done GunnarHj  :)

 20:31:59 <GunnarHj> And yes, I will dig in more areas soon.

 20:32:05 <czajkowski> thanks

 20:32:39 <beuno> EgyParadox, you around?

 20:32:42 <EgyParadox> Yes I am here

 20:32:46 <beuno> sweet

 20:32:50 <GunnarHj> Thanks for you time, guys!

 20:32:53 <beuno> #topic EgyParadox's application

 20:33:08 <beuno> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyParadox

 20:33:24 <czajkowski> EgyParadox: welcome thanks for coming along

 20:33:42 <EgyParadox> :)

 20:33:59 <beuno> EgyParadox, tell us about yourself

 20:34:29 <EgyParadox> My name is Omar Mohsen, I started using Ubuntu about 6 years ago

 20:34:51 <EgyParadox> I joined the Egyptian LoCo team about 2 years ago

 20:35:51 <EgyParadox> My contribution is mainly support through different ways

 20:35:53 <EgyParadox> through IRC, events

 20:36:28 <EgyParadox> I also administer our social media pages

 20:36:52 <czajkowski> EgyParadox: so you help grow the locoteam?

 20:37:08 <EgyParadox> yes czajkowski

 20:37:36 <czajkowski> EgyParadox: what would you like to do to help your team, and get more people involved in your community ?

 20:38:46 <EgyParadox> organize more events

 20:39:15 <beuno> EgyParadox, you're involved in both the Egypt and Malaysian LoCo's?

 20:39:36 <EgyParadox> I wanted to be involved in the Malaysian LoCo but I no longer live there

 20:39:45 <beuno> ah, I see  :)

 20:40:18 <beuno> EgyParadox, got quite a few testimonials as well!

 20:40:49 <mgamal> guys

 20:40:50 <EgyParadox> I provided IRC support for about 2 years

 20:40:53 <czajkowski> EgyParadox: last question, what do you plan to do in the future to help your team? anything specific ?

 20:40:56 <mgamal> sorry to interfere

 20:41:16 <czajkowski> mgamal: we're in the middle of an appliction, is it regarding EgyParadox ?

 20:41:21 <mgamal> yes

 20:41:33 <mgamal> I just wanted to say I didn't have time to write my testimonial

 20:41:59 <mgamal> but I'd like to tell EgyParadox he was such a great team mate in the Egyptian LoCo :)

 20:42:18 <mgamal> he contributed a lot to the LoCo's social media presence

 20:42:42 <mgamal> and he helped get us about 2000 followers on our FB pages and twitter

 20:43:18 <czajkowski> mgamal: thanks

 20:46:20 <beuno> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TadeasParik

 20:47:02 <TadeasParik> can I start?

 20:47:11 <czajkowski> TadeasParik: yup thanks for coming

 20:47:11 <beuno> TadeasParik, yes!

 20:47:21 <czajkowski> TadeasParik: can you tell us a little bit about yourself ?

 20:47:23 <czajkowski> please

 20:47:28 <TadeasParik> ok, so my name is Tadeáš Pařík, 26 years old, Prague, Czech republic

 20:47:38 <TadeasParik> I use Ubuntu from 8.04 and from 2008 I am active member of our Czech Ubuntu forum where I help with the standard problems, from this year I am also on Launchpad

 20:48:25 <TadeasParik> from 2010 I am active moderator of this forum and from 2011 I am admin of this forum and of all ubuntu official pages in Czech republic (ubuntu.cz, facebook, G+ pages, Czech Ubuntu wiki etc.)

 20:48:46 <TadeasParik> I am especially involved in all official events/meetings/presentations about Ubuntu in the Czech republic (I represented Ubuntu onLinuxExpo conference, there were also other distros and Microsoft)

 20:49:17 <TadeasParik> and also in non official, e.g. we have special Ubuntu beer event in Prague

 20:49:23 <beuno> TadeasParik, have you by any chance met Jenda?

 20:49:46 <TadeasParik> I know him from our forum, but unfortunately he is not active memeber now...

 20:50:06 <vojtech_t> Jenda is unfortunately long time inactive

 20:50:12 <beuno> yeah, I know

 20:50:28 <beuno> thought maybe he'd still go to the parties for the beer at least :)

 20:51:07 <TadeasParik> I helped to organise two release party in Czech republic, during the first one I was presenting about new Ubuntu 11.04 and for the second one I found the place and I was fronting this action

 20:51:34 <TadeasParik> there were some articles on Czech IT portals

 20:52:14 <TadeasParik> on Launchpad I am a member of translation team

 20:52:19 <beuno> TadeasParik, you seem to only have one testimonial (although a strong one)

 20:52:34 <beuno> is the .cz LoCo small?

 20:52:36 <TadeasParik> so we are preparing czech localization

 20:52:44 <vojtech_t> it's because there are only few active ubunteros in the czech rep.

 20:52:54 <vojtech_t> and i'm the only one active ubuntu member

 20:52:54 <czajkowski> it's an approved loco

 20:53:02 <TadeasParik> yes, there is only Vojta and me...

 20:53:04 <czajkowski> vojtech_t: you dont have to be an approved member to leave a comment

 20:53:14 <TadeasParik> I mean active members...

 20:53:14 <czajkowski> anyone can leave a testimonal on a wiki page

 20:53:30 <czajkowski> for an approved loco there are only 2 active members....

 20:53:55 <beuno> vojtech_t, so I guess you're a strong supporter of TadeasParik?

 20:54:02 <vojtech_t> czajkowski, we have about 5-10 really active people

 20:54:03 <TadeasParik> for me it is life's hobby...

 20:54:07 <vojtech_t> beuno: yes

 20:54:38 <beuno> awesome

 20:54:46 <beuno> TadeasParik, what does the future look like to you?

 20:54:59 <vojtech_t> czajkowski, maybe it's my fault, because i thought only ubuntu members can write testimonials

 20:55:42 <TadeasParik> I would like to finish our Czech localization, now we are preparing next GlobalJam and we started with preparations for Release party...

 20:55:51 <beuno> vojtech_t, that's fine, you think there's more fans out there then?

 20:56:17 <TadeasParik> and I would like to find more active people here for our LoCo

 20:56:44 <beuno> maybe we can trick jenda to getting involved again  :)

 20:56:47 <vojtech_t> beuno, yes, as forum administrator tadeas is really popular

 20:57:05 <czajkowski> beuno: shall we vote

 20:57:10 <beuno> lets!
