 15:03:03 <doko> - look at webkit-1.91 build failure, not a binutils issue, > 4G archive not supported (never was). needs webkit buildsystem changes

 15:03:03 <doko> - investigate qt4-x11 ftbfs on arm* over the weekend. buildd issue, swapping to death. builds locally, so there must be extra load on the buildd.

 15:03:03 <doko> - start quantal test rebuild

 15:03:03 <doko> - fix or delegate ftbfs in main, now almost done, although the ftbfs pages don't show progress (unapproved and proposed not shown)

 15:03:05 <doko> - not yet addressed in main: genshi, git, libgtk2-perl, mksh, feedparser (libxml2 issue), ubuntuone-client

 15:03:08 <doko> - fix ftbfs in package sets (almost done)

 15:03:10 <doko> - again, followup on MIRs, and component mismatches, seeded restricted components

 15:03:12 <doko> - package libvigraimpex 1.8 to fix ftbfs (just two rdeps, so upgrade should be fine, tested).

 15:03:14 <doko> - fix binutils bfd.h header inclusion, seen in package test rebuilds

 15:03:16 <doko> - remove the va_list info/warning on arm, accepted upstream and put in gcc-4.7

 15:03:18 <doko> - fix python2.7 regression (please accept into -proposed, so that it can build)

 15:03:20 <doko> - libjpeg-turbo update to 1.2.1

 15:03:24 <doko> - gcc-4.7.2 release packages

 15:03:26 <doko> - python3.3 rc3 packages

 15:03:28 <doko> (done)

 15:04:13 <slangasek> - short week(s), vacation last week and now playing catch-up

 15:04:41 <slangasek> - working on XDG_RUNTIME_DIR which has unfortunately still not landed; have had a few false starts with the necessary pam module

 15:04:55 <slangasek> - working on getting UEFI SecureBoot shim support landed

 15:05:58 <slangasek> - uploaded a more-asynchronous mountall to Debian unstable that fixes some problems in cloud init, and seems to hold together for the rest of us - and might even make boot faster. testing welcome, I'll be asking for this in quantal post-beta and pushing for a precise SRU

 15:06:02 <slangasek> (done)

 15:06:15 <xnox> * ubiquity:

 15:15:55 <cjwatson> jodh: yay Ogham

 15:17:25 <slangasek> I did not recognize it as ogham, until I turned my head sideways

 15:17:27 <slangasek> ev:

 15:17:37 <jodh> cjwatson: :)

 15:17:39 <ev> - Short week; narrow boating on Friday and Monday.

 15:17:39 <ev> - More research on top-k for arbitrary date ranges. We have a reasonable

 15:17:39 <ev> solution, but I may implmenet something simplier just so we have a solution

 15:17:39 <ev> to the failing to load year view a bit sooner.

 15:17:39 <ev> - Learning a lot more of D3.js to implement Matthew's errors.ubuntu.com front

 15:17:47 <ev> page redesign and milestone lines on the average errors per day graph. Now

 15:17:48 <ev> implemented, though I still need to file a RT for the deployment.

 15:17:48 <ev> - Implemented part of the reprocessing failed retraces work, as Seb

 15:17:48 <ev> potentially needs it and I've been putting it off for too long :). Once

 15:17:48 <ev> deployed (RT 56342) we'll be able to selectively run stacktrace address

 15:17:48 <ev> signatures back through the retracing and bucketing process.

 15:17:48 <ev> - Starting to piece together a presentation with Matthew for UDS.

 15:17:50 <ev> (done)

 15:26:50 <stokachu> the other 2 are

 15:28:23 <stokachu> ill add libgconf to my todo list

 15:28:29 <doko> thanks

 15:29:18 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:29:40 <slangasek> bdmurray: how do things look for us?

 15:30:14 <bdmurray> well the rls-q- queues seem to have grown a lot

 15:30:38 <bdmurray> so daunting?

 15:31:00 <slangasek> queues plural - meaning for all teams, not just ours?

 15:31:19 <bdmurray> plural as in -incoming and -tracking

 15:31:30 <slangasek> ok

 15:31:38 <cjwatson> I rejected some of -incoming last week and pushed the rest into -tracking

 15:31:43 <cjwatson> I think most of the -tracking growth is from that

 15:31:53 <slangasek> tracking had seemed reasonably under control before I left... ah, cjwatson strikes ;)

 15:32:00 <doko> filed some main ftbfs as release relevant too

 15:32:00 <cjwatson> Recent -incoming growth is mostly just expected ISO testing input

 15:32:16 <slangasek> can we farm some of those bugs out here?

 15:32:20 <cjwatson> slangasek: -incoming had got up to 15-20 or so by last meeting

 15:32:31 <cjwatson> Couldn't reject them all :)

 15:33:22 <bdmurray> regarding the incoming I was only able to recreate bug 1055326 in ubiquity only mode

 15:33:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1055326 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "During installation, flashplugin fails to install with: IOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno -2] Name or service not known" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1055326

 15:33:28 <slangasek> I think we should turf bug #1017031; I suspect it was a transitional issue around the time we were making changes to dpkg

 15:33:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1017031 in dpkg (Ubuntu Quantal) "dpkg: error: duplicate file trigger interest for filename `/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules' and package `libgtk2.0-0:amd64'" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1017031

 15:33:42 <slangasek> if it were a real problem, there'd be a lot more noise on it

 15:34:34 <bdmurray> slangasek: is there anything I could search for re 1017031?

 15:34:36 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you agree with that assessment?  or should we be checking for duplicates somewhere before turfing that?

 15:34:52 <slangasek> bdmurray: right - it'd be the "duplicate file trigger interest for filename" string

 15:35:17 <stokachu> slangasek, is gconf ma'd completely now?

 15:35:21 <stokachu> im looking through the changelog

 15:35:31 <bdmurray> okay, I'll look around and turf if I don't find anything

 15:36:03 <cjwatson> I've asked for retesting of bug 699802

 15:36:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 699802 in grub2 (Ubuntu Quantal) "error:: no video mode activated" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/699802

 15:37:18 <cjwatson> (Though I suspect it has been dogpiled)

 15:37:19 <slangasek> stokachu: gconf certainly should be completely MA

 15:37:30 <stokachu> but not libgconf

 15:37:59 <slangasek> bdmurray: alright; I'm going to pre-emptively close the bug since I think it's invalid, if you find more hits please reopen

 15:38:03 <slangasek> stokachu: sure it is

 15:39:10 <stokachu> ok.. hmm doko, what problems are being faced with openjdk?

 15:40:14 <doko> basically running downloaded aps which have i386 only on amd64

 15:40:19 <slangasek> stokachu: I suspect he just hasn't tested whether gconf is multiarched?

 15:40:29 <doko> no, I hadn't =)

 15:40:48 <stokachu> ah

 15:41:01 <slangasek> bug #987212

 15:41:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 987212 in avahi (Ubuntu Quantal) "Wireless printer "Processing - Unable to locate printer."" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/987212

 15:41:19 <stokachu> doko, in that case gconf is done and the other two are either in quantal and making there way into precise

 15:41:24 <slangasek> not sure this should be on our list; probably needs to be -notfixing'ed

 15:41:24 <doko> nice

 15:41:27 <stokachu> or waiting for sponsorship

 15:41:47 <cjwatson> Bug 1048584 isn't really ours, but I'll fix it anyway

 15:41:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1048584 in language-selector (Ubuntu Quantal) "kdevelop-php should pull kdevelop-php-l10n in pkg_depends" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1048584

 15:42:05 <stokachu> sorry i was confused there for a minute

 15:42:20 <slangasek> bdmurray, cjwatson: either of you think we shouldn't turf 987212?  I think it's on our list per the SRU targeting process, not due to an explicit -incoming accept

 15:43:34 <bdmurray> slangasek: agreed

 15:43:44 <slangasek> ogra_: should bug #1028905 be assigned to you?

 15:43:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1028905 in cdrom-detect (Ubuntu Quantal) "cdrom-detect in quantal omap4 hangs trying to look for install media on an extended partition" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1028905

 15:43:49 <slangasek> (you mentioned it in your report)

 15:44:05 <cjwatson> slangasek: I agree

 15:44:06 <ogra_> oh,m i thought i assigned it already

 15:44:21 <slangasek> ogra_: assigned now :)

 15:44:26 <ogra_> done

 15:44:31 <ogra_> bah, *snap* :)

 15:45:23 <slangasek> bug #1030278 - fun

 15:45:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1030278 in python-apt (Ubuntu Quantal) "Quantal failed to install: ubiquity crashed in apt/progress/text.py in pulse: OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1030278

 15:45:35 <slangasek> jodh: ^^ can I give this one to you?

 15:45:48 <jodh> slangasek: no probs

 15:46:00 <cjwatson> Yeah - googling was vaguely helpful for that but not enough to produce a clear fix

 15:46:07 <cjwatson> juliank might be helpful if you can find him on IRC

 15:46:53 * slangasek learns that foundations owns git ;)

 15:47:08 <xnox> slangasek: no, just git-svn =))))

 15:47:22 <slangasek> doko: does bug #1056728 cause the package to fail to build?

 15:47:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1056728 in git (Ubuntu Quantal) "git-svn needs an update for subversion 1.7.x" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1056728

 15:47:36 <doko> yes

 15:48:16 <doko> jnieder did propose a patch to just disable these tests, he did give up extracting all the commits

 15:48:59 <stokachu> the internet is stupid

 15:48:59 <slangasek> doko: what's the "4.12" version you mention?  git is currently at version 1.7.10.4

 15:49:15 <doko> ?

 15:49:31 <slangasek> doko: from the bug description - you said "either disable the failing test (?), backport the the subversion 1.7.x support, or update to 4.12."

 15:49:35 <slangasek> I don't know what 4.12 is

 15:50:00 <slangasek> 1.7.12, maybe?

 15:50:21 <doko> yes

 15:50:27 <doko> 1.7.12.1 even

 15:50:29 <slangasek> ok

 15:51:27 <slangasek> looks like there are a bunch of package build failures on this list

 15:51:33 <slangasek> please jump in and help out with these, guys

 15:51:59 <slangasek> (for reference)

 15:52:58 <cjwatson> Yep.  I know what I'm doing for the rest of the week ;-)

 15:53:23 <stokachu> sorry how do you tell whats failing to buidl on this link?

 15:53:25 <slangasek> bug #1054346 - looks like there's a related branch.  Does Dylan have upload rights on ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu?

 15:53:39 <cjwatson> stokachu: search for ftbfs

 15:53:43 <stokachu> ah ok thanks

 15:53:44 <slangasek> stokachu: the bugs that have "FTBFS" or "build" in their description, roughly

 15:54:09 <xnox> slangasek: i think that will go in after beta2 is released.

 15:54:12 <cjwatson> stgraber said he was going to sponsor u-s-u, I think

 15:54:41 <stgraber> yep

 15:54:47 <slangasek> ok, assigning

 15:55:00 <slangasek> that's probably enough about bugs for now

 15:55:07 <slangasek> I think -

 15:55:14 <slangasek> bdmurray: or is there anything else?

 15:55:41 <bdmurray> mvo added a patch to bug 1015567 fwiw

 15:55:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1015567 in dpkg (Ubuntu Quantal) "upgrade failed: mixed non-coinstallable and coinstallable package instances present" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1015567

 15:56:24 <bdmurray> and mvo has a merge proposal for bug 1052605

 15:56:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1052605 in update-manager (Ubuntu Quantal) "ERROR:root:getListFromFile: no '/usr/share/update-manager/removal_blacklist.cfg' found: exception during Precise to Quantal upgrade on amd64+mac" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1052605

 15:56:28 <bdmurray> https://code.launchpad.net/~mvo/ubuntu-release-upgrader/lp1052605/+merge/125693

 15:56:42 <cjwatson> Oh, yeah, I looked at that MP and ran away

 15:56:50 <cjwatson> I'll steel myself and have another look

 15:57:11 <slangasek> xnox: 1015567 is assigned to you, are you ok to follow through?  or should we kick it over to infinity, since he's to blame for everything broken in dpkg right now? :)

 15:57:20 <xnox> bdmurray: yes, mvo was pinging me about dpkg. I have small test to run against it & we agreed on the plan of fixing it for real as well as appying that work around patch.

 15:57:26 <slangasek> spiff

 15:58:08 <slangasek> well, I was going to pester people about work items too, but we seem to have run out of time for that

 15:58:18 <slangasek> so I'll come knocking on your cubicle walls individually :)

 15:58:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:58:24 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:58:54 <cjwatson> please can I have enough I/O over USB that I can run lintian over grub2 and read mail at the same time

 15:58:57 <cjwatson> never mind

 15:59:09 <xnox> ev: how do you get RT deployments done? RT 55554 is still not done

 15:59:16 <cjwatson> Oh, should we drop data.tar.xz-member-without-dpkg-pre-depends from lintian now?

 15:59:19 <xnox> the ubuntu-geonames lookup.

 15:59:19 <ev> xnox: I kindly nag

 15:59:39 <ev> xnox: hang out in #webops

 15:59:43 <xnox> hm....

 15:59:50 * ogra_ wishes we could disable apport on arm installs by default

 15:59:50 <ev> ask if someone can look at it during your active hours

 16:00:03 <xnox> ok.

 16:00:04 <slangasek> cjwatson: ah, is that a delta?  seems like we could drop it now

 16:00:07 <ev> failing that, ask slangasek to bump the priority and raise it at the next meeting

 16:00:08 <slangasek> is LP happy for it to go away?

 16:00:11 <cjwatson> Actually it apparently isn't

 16:00:16 <ogra_> i just had to wait 20min for a stuck desktop to recover because apport colletced stuff

 16:00:49 <cjwatson> There's an Ubuntu profile thing in lintian to raise it from pedantic to serious

 16:00:52 <slangasek> apport is such a neat freak

 16:00:54 <ogra_> and now apt-update-xapian-index kicked in ...

 16:01:08 <cjwatson> So I might just commit upstream to drop that back to pedantic - yeah, LP doesn't care any more

 16:01:13 <ogra_> which will keep it stuck for about another hour

 16:01:37 * ogra_ ponders a release note "after install dont touch your panda installation for 2h"

 16:01:59 <cjwatson> Oh, haha, already done upstream

 16:02:02 <xnox> ogra_: or use it at 3-4am in the morning =)

 16:02:09 <ogra_> heh
