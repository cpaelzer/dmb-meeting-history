 16:04:00 <Daviey> #TOPIC Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:04:07 <Daviey> smoser follow up on bug 1028453

 16:04:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1028453 in livecd-rootfs (Ubuntu) "Quantal Ubuntu Server minimal install oversized" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1028453

 16:04:19 <jamespage> fixed

 16:04:26 <Daviey> super

 16:04:26 <jamespage> \o/

 16:04:36 <Daviey> jamespage to look into aligning release team and server team trackign reports

 16:04:38 <smoser> woot

 16:04:57 <skaet> :)

 16:05:17 <Daviey> Mr Page?

 16:05:20 <jamespage> still thinking about that one - I think we should probably just use the release team report - but it lacks MIR and other team tracking

 16:05:28 <jamespage> c/f

 16:05:47 <Daviey> jamespage: OK, i missed this action.  Can we organise an audio chat with interetsed people to gauge outcomes?

 16:06:01 <jamespage> sure

 16:06:04 <Daviey> #TOPIC Quantal Development

 16:06:22 <Daviey> jamespage or smoser, want to take release-bugs.html?

 16:06:32 <jamespage> o.

 16:06:35 <jamespage> ill do it

 16:06:46 <jamespage> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:07:05 <jamespage> only a few things on this report now.

 16:07:15 <jamespage> bug 1024326

 16:07:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1024326 in horizon (Ubuntu) "node.js is required for access to the dashboard" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1024326

 16:07:35 <adam_g> i committed a new fix for that last night. much simpler and cleaner

 16:07:58 <adam_g> so, with the next upload it should be fixed. i'd like to find a way to integrate the build steps into package build, tho

 16:08:07 <smoser> adam_g, link?

 16:08:23 <smoser> ah. http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/horizon/precise-folsom-proposed/revision/103

 16:08:52 <zul> hi ho

 16:08:58 <Daviey> jamespage: is the breadth of the report accurate, i haven't added anything myself for ages

 16:09:14 <jamespage> see action above about release tracking bugs

 16:09:36 <jamespage> hallyn: bug 1040033

 16:09:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1040033 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Quantal) "Fresh VM installs via preseeded oneiric isos sometimes fail with filesystem issues" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1040033

 16:10:18 <jamespage> ah - I see last comment says HEAD fixes stuff - guess you just need to narrow things down

 16:10:27 <jamespage> and from http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:11:19 <jamespage> ivoks has a really old bug assigned - bug 671065

 16:11:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 671065 in dovecot (Ubuntu Quantal) "deliver broken because dovecot.conf uses !include_try" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/671065

 16:11:41 <jamespage> hmm - not in channel - I'll followup - need to pester him for test cases anyway

 16:12:20 <jamespage> we have a load of undecided bugs for maas and juju  - which at least need a priority setting.

 16:12:58 <jamespage> my recommendation would be to drop the quantal tasks for the time being; that way the bug stays around - but we are not commiting to fix it for quantal unless we raise the tasks....

 16:13:35 <jamespage> smoser, can you and roaksoax review the maas ones - I'll pickup the juju ones with SpamapS

 16:13:45 <jamespage> ...

 16:13:51 <jamespage> thats be done on release bugs....

 16:14:01 <jamespage> of note anyway :-)

 16:14:02 <Daviey> super

 16:14:12 <Daviey> any extra ones that should be added?

 16:14:19 <smoser> jamespage, will do.

 16:14:30 <Daviey> ok

 16:14:40 <Daviey> smoser: do you want to go through http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-overview.html ?

 16:14:47 <jimbaker> fwiw, i think we have been doing a good effort on closing out the juju bugs, led by SpamapS

 16:15:15 <jamespage> jimbaker, +1 to that - there are just alot hanging around from last cycles MIR review

 16:15:36 <smoser> sure. i'll go through.

 16:15:50 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-qa

 16:16:00 <smoser> i'll just hit red ones.

 16:16:01 <smoser> jamespage, ?

 16:16:27 <jamespage> ?

 16:16:39 <smoser> any comment on servercloud-q-opensetack-qa

 16:16:41 <arosales> is zul on point for servercloud-q-openstack-qa

 16:16:46 <smoser> ah. sorry. zul

 16:16:47 <jamespage> yep

 16:16:49 <jamespage> :-)

 16:16:53 <zul> dah

 16:16:55 <smoser> yes. i see that. thakn you arosales

 16:17:12 <Daviey> zul is acridness to the WI, but in reality jamespage and adam_g have had a significant influence

 16:17:48 <Daviey> err, "according to"*  .. damn dictionary

 16:17:54 <zul> i had to look up that word

 16:17:59 <smoser> fun... well anyone want to talk to that ?

 16:18:00 <smoser> its behind.

 16:18:27 <Daviey> primarily, reporting on upsteam gerrit.. pre-merge.. adam_g / jamespage ?

 16:19:02 <jamespage> I'll have to defer to adam_g - my involvement this cycle has been mainly doing password resets for zul

 16:19:17 <smoser> ok.

 16:19:19 <smoser> lets move on.

 16:19:30 <smoser> adam_g, zul, please take al ook at that today.

 16:19:33 <adam_g> Daviey: i have the majority of htat that work done

 16:19:34 <smoser> talk amoungst yourselves.

 16:19:46 <adam_g> just need to implement it live on the cluster. was preparing to do that a few weeks ago when i was hijacked with other things

 16:20:09 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:20:33 <smoser> that seems more SpamapS per this group

 16:20:48 <smoser> i belive there is more progress there than shown

 16:21:23 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-deployment

 16:21:37 <smoser> i'll speak for rbasak on that. he has made considerable progress on it.

 16:21:46 <smoser> and the work remaining seems to be known

 16:22:12 <SpamapS> smoser: I'd have to poll everybody listed there. but in general that effort has been going slower than expected

 16:22:36 <smoser> SpamapS, thank you

 16:22:52 <smoser> please do try to get it into some sort of more current state (if that includes POSTPONE)

 16:22:56 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-folsom

 16:23:04 <SpamapS> I'll poke a few of them though, I see a coupel WI's that have been half-done for a while

 16:23:07 <smoser> zul, you're most of those. ddoes that look reasonable?

 16:23:13 * smoser will get my 2 updated on that.

 16:23:34 <zul> yeah more of it will be "DONE" as we get cloesr to release

 16:23:52 <smoser> i'll poke around, but my feeling is public glance is POSTPONED

 16:23:53 <Daviey> zul: when will nova for folsom for example, be marked DONE?

 16:24:04 <Daviey> smoser: lets discuss that after

 16:24:29 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-stable

 16:24:40 <smoser> zul?

 16:24:53 <zul> ill update the spec

 16:25:14 <smoser> gracias

 16:25:14 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-iso-tests-review

 16:25:25 <smoser> there are  a bunch of people listed on tasks there, but jamespage name on the item.

 16:25:33 <jamespage> smoser, that should catchup this week

 16:25:47 <jamespage> I'm gonna pester jibel about upgrade testing.... and ivoks for mail stuff

 16:26:10 <smoser> roaksoax, i'm assuming that powernap needs to go to POSTPONED

 16:26:40 <smoser> i'll follow up with roaksoax

 16:26:41 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:27:14 <Daviey> Ursinha: ^ ?

 16:27:16 <smoser> jamespage, ^ you again

 16:27:20 <smoser> or Ursinha

 16:27:32 <Daviey> James page is all done on that blueprint.

 16:27:48 <jamespage> yeah - again I'll followup with Ursinha (I keep forgetting and its my blueprint)

 16:27:52 <smoser> k. moving on.

 16:28:03 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-maas-next-steps

 16:28:07 <smoser> roaksoax, ^ ?

 16:28:12 <smoser> there is a bunch of work to do there.

 16:28:14 <smoser> i'll speak to it.

 16:28:46 <smoser> that is "Essential" and will be accomplished to a satisfactory end.

 16:29:06 <Daviey> nothing like a satisfactory ending

 16:29:12 <smoser> servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy

 16:29:15 <roaksoax> smoser: there are a couple bugs need to be addressed and other but currently blocked too due to

 16:29:20 <roaksoax> not having quantal support

 16:30:03 <smoser> SpamapS, that looks like yours. is there updates there?

 16:30:37 <smoser> servercloud-q-openstack-ha https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-ha

 16:30:44 <SpamapS> smoser: the two TODO's are still valid, and have to be completed this cycle.

 16:30:56 <smoser> SpamapS, thank you.

 16:31:09 <smoser> roaksoax, you're next there. ... i'm uguessing that one can stand some updates.

 16:31:32 <smoser> servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:31:32 <Daviey> was,

 16:31:36 <Daviey> "juju charms for DRBD (adam_g says it is impossible, SpampS seems it is possible): TODO" resolved?

 16:31:51 <zul> i think we need a steel cage for that one

 16:31:52 <SpamapS> we never have worked on it

 16:32:02 <SpamapS> but yeah I still believe its possible :)

 16:32:03 <adam_g> hehe

 16:32:09 <adam_g> SpamapS: go for it!

 16:32:17 <roaksoax> smoser: since I have been concentrated on maas the last two weeks I couldn't really advance any work on the HA stuff. But there are updates that need to be considered and will catch up with zul /adam_g as it relates to ha specific stuff for openstack

 16:32:18 <Daviey> smoser: do you have capacity to prove us all wrong?

 16:32:27 <smoser> roaksoax, gracias.

 16:32:55 <smoser> i want no part of the SpamapS adam_g steel cage

 16:32:55 <SpamapS> drbd seems so old fashioned.. don't people just do RAID1 across volumes these days?

 16:33:26 <smoser> alright. i think that is enough there.

 16:33:27 <adam_g> drbd is basically distributed raid1

 16:33:32 * SpamapS would promise not to use his roundhouse

 16:33:47 <smoser> please do take a bit of time today and make sure your blueprints represent their actual state.

 16:34:02 <smoser> and remember that we're past beta1, and there is not much time remaining.

 16:34:27 <smoser> and miles to go before i sleep.

 16:34:35 <smoser> lets move on.

 16:34:43 <Daviey> thank you Mr Moser.

 16:34:48 <Daviey> #TOPIC Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:34:50 <smoser> you are most welcome.

 16:35:24 <Daviey> Anyone else travelling soon?

 16:35:53 <Daviey> OpenStack Conference, San Diego, Oct 15-18, 2012 .. number of us going.

 16:36:27 <Daviey> UDS, Copenhagen, Denmark , 29th Oct – 1st Nov 2012

 16:36:34 <Daviey> Anything else?

 16:36:45 <Daviey> #TOPIC Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:37:20 <Daviey> Great to see we got Beta-1 out in reasonable shape, what is the plans between now and the next milestone for enrichment in testing?

 16:37:57 <Daviey> Nobody from QA here?

 16:38:06 <arosales> btw, for events Surge is also coming up on Sept 27, and jimbaker is giving  a Big Data meetup preso on Sept 19.

 16:38:14 <Daviey> *sigh*

 16:39:02 <Daviey> Okay, lets move frustratedly on.

 16:39:12 <Daviey> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:39:45 <Daviey> and no smb.

 16:39:56 <Daviey> ogasawara: anyone from kernel here?

 16:41:10 <Daviey> marvellous

 16:41:19 <Daviey> [TOPiC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:41:26 <arosales> rbask is on holiday

 16:41:26 <jamespage> rbasak on holiday

 16:41:40 <Daviey> Please, can someone cover this, before i shoot myself?

 16:41:45 <arosales> I think he synced up with smoser though

 16:41:51 <Daviey> smoser: ^?

 16:42:02 <arosales> we are working on adding in ARM support int MAAS

 16:42:06 <arosales> that is the main effort

 16:42:17 <smoser> sure...

 16:42:29 <Daviey> anything else of note

 16:42:30 <Daviey> ?

 16:42:37 <smoser> rbasak has made considerable and impressive progresses on maas and arm.

 16:42:49 <Daviey> \o/

 16:43:01 <smoser> the ephemeral images were giving him pai, but he has hacked his way around that, and my reproduction of that has lead me to chasing some other issues in those images.

 16:43:03 <Daviey> smoser: does it work with panda?

 16:43:17 <smoser> bug 1031065

 16:43:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1031065 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "cloud-init-nonet runs 'start networking' explicitly" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1031065

 16:43:22 <smoser> i do not believe it works with panda

 16:43:27 <Daviey> what about qemu-system-arm-highbank ?

 16:43:49 <smoser> also, of interesting work there, dannf reportably can make things work with qemu-system-arm

 16:44:04 <Daviey> qemu-system-arm -M highbank*

 16:44:07 <smoser> https://launchpad.net/~dannf/+archive/qemu-highbank/+packages

 16:44:26 <smoser> ping him for more info there.

 16:44:27 <Daviey> that should be good in the archive now

 16:44:46 <Daviey> The blocker for me, was a devicetree which is now fixed

 16:44:50 <smoser> last i spoke to him on it, he had a kernel that would boot, but the latest highbank kernel for precise would not.

 16:45:15 <Daviey> okay, thanks smoser

 16:45:16 <smoser> but yeah, haivng some sort of qemu functional would be huge.

 16:45:21 <Daviey> moving on?

 16:45:32 <Daviey> #TOPIC Open Discussion

 16:45:35 <ogra_> omap works pretty well

 16:45:35 <smoser> and ideally that can be booted with cloud images and cloud-localds

 16:45:58 <ogra_> (but limited to 512M indeed)

 16:46:16 <Daviey> ogra_: might want to grab you to help polish this stuff :)

 16:46:23 <ogra_> feel free

 16:46:42 <Daviey> ogra_: Would like to do a PXE boot via system-arm.. which might be interesting

 16:46:49 <SpamapS> Dunno if this was brought up in the bugs discussion, but Juju is a bit broken in quantal right now

 16:47:16 <Daviey> SpamapS: oh?

 16:47:20 <SpamapS> There's a regression in python that hit yesterday, bug 1048710

 16:47:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1048710 in python3.2 (Ubuntu) "Regression in argparse for Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1048710

 16:47:23 <SpamapS> Barry Warsaw is on it

 16:47:31 <ogra_> Daviey, qemu can boot our images out of the box (including the whole bootloader bits) so that shouldnt be any prob

 16:47:52 <SpamapS> Its pretty serious as it breaks the argparsing for all of juju's cli utilities

 16:48:09 <Daviey> Joy

 16:48:21 * Daviey ads it to tracking

 16:48:21 <SpamapS> anyway, I'm sure it will be resolved soon, but just a heads up that you may need to downgrade python2.7 if you want to have a working juju on quantal

 16:48:50 <SpamapS> Daviey: in case that bug does not fix it, there's also a juju bug, bug #1048864 , that is worth tracking

 16:48:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1048864 in juju (Ubuntu Quantal) "Latest python in quantal breaks juju test suite" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1048864

 16:49:02 <Daviey> SpamapS: juju/precise archive + jitsu... Is it possible?

 16:49:07 <SpamapS> Daviey: it may end up being duped to 1048710 .. we'll see

 16:49:21 <jamespage> SpamapS, thats on the release bugs list (both of them)

 16:49:26 <SpamapS> Daviey: we can put juju-jitsu in backports

 16:49:40 <SpamapS> jamespage: right, because I targetted at quantal

 16:49:41 <Daviey> SpamapS: but does it work?

 16:49:52 <SpamapS> Daviey: It should. popey was looking at it.

 16:50:02 <Daviey> SpamapS: he pinged me otherwise this morning :(

 16:50:18 <SpamapS> Daviey: bummer. Ok, we'll have to dive into that

 16:50:24 <Daviey> thanks

 16:50:31 <Daviey> Anything else?

 16:51:06 <SpamapS> Daviey: wild thing, I think you move me.
