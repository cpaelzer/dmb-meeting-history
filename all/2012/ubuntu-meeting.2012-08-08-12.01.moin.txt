 12:03:54 <Destine> Good evening

 12:04:18 <IdleOne> Good Morning here

 12:04:29 <Pendulum> Ravi325, are you here?

 12:04:44 <smartboyhw> I don't see him on the user list...

 12:05:52 <head_victim> Just gotta check in case they're aliasing.

 12:08:00 <smartboyhw> Sounds like he's not here...

 12:09:42 <Pendulum> Okay, it looks like Ravi325 isn't here. As he's the only applicant, I guess we can put this down as a very short meeting. Thank you to all the board members who showed up.
