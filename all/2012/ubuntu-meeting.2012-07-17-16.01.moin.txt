 16:01:51 <utlemming> Welcome everyone to our server meeting!

 16:01:59 <utlemming> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:27 <zul> hiho

 16:02:31 <utlemming> jamespage: you had an action to checkin with MIR team on expected review timescales for server MIRs

 16:02:56 <utlemming> and zul to make sure relevant MIR bugs have ubuntu-server-release subscribed

 16:02:58 <jamespage> most MIR's are now assigned an owner - there are a few I still need to checkin on

 16:03:09 <zul> utlemming: oops

 16:03:28 <jamespage> I also went through the MIR team subscribed bugs and added the 'Ubuntu Server Team' a bug subscription for those packages

 16:04:00 <jamespage> so I think the list is now up-to-date in http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:04:29 <utlemming> jamespage: is there any further action on that? Or do we need to carry it over for next week?

 16:04:31 <zul> i have at least 5 more dependencies coming up, still need to be reviewed by an archvie admin

 16:04:51 <jamespage> there is but the original action got me todo the important stuff so please close

 16:05:10 <jamespage> I'll keep pushing on this stuff - lets monitor through the development update section

 16:05:14 <utlemming> zul: do we need followup next week?

 16:05:33 <zul> utlemming: no i can do that once they get into the archive

 16:05:41 <utlemming> okay, moving on...

 16:05:50 <utlemming> arosales: had an action to sort out blueprints and get the trend line working correctly

 16:06:03 <utlemming> arosale: do you have a status update for us?

 16:06:09 <arosales> I spoke with Daviey on the topic mapping

 16:06:18 <arosales> I need to get the trend line reset

 16:06:29 <arosales> I'll try to get that done this week.

 16:07:01 <utlemming> #action arosales and daviey to work on trend line reset

 16:07:01 * meetingology arosales and daviey to work on trend line reset

 16:07:29 <Daviey> inpreogressy-done-ish

 16:07:35 <utlemming> smoser, jamespage: had an action for review and assign SRU bug across team.

 16:07:40 <jamespage> done

 16:08:11 <utlemming> okay, rbasak: find out whether openvswitch module can be enabled for quantal ARM kernels

 16:08:33 <jamespage> utlemming, mark that done - kernel team confirmed they would review

 16:09:04 <utlemming> jamespage: ack

 16:09:10 <utlemming> #topic Quantal Development

 16:09:48 <utlemming> Any topics for Quantal Development?

 16:09:57 <arosales> A few for Blueprints

 16:10:06 <arosales> utlemming: may I interject?

 16:10:15 <utlemming> arosales: please

 16:10:35 <arosales> So we should roughly be around 30% complete for BPs at this point in the cycle

 16:10:48 <arosales> there are a few that are at 0%

 16:11:14 <arosales> I'll step through those if you don't mind utlemming

 16:11:34 <arosales> ARM

 16:11:42 <arosales> rbask a few that are at 0%

 16:12:02 <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-arm.html

 16:12:06 <arosales> specifically

 16:12:14 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-benchmark-and-performance

 16:12:14 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-server-storage-testing

 16:12:24 <arosales> for rbasak for the log minutes

 16:12:37 <arosales> utlemming: push to the clouds

 16:12:43 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-push-to-the-clouds

 16:12:56 <arosales> I think hardware is in progress there, other status up to date?

 16:13:07 <arosales> Bug Triage

 16:13:23 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:13:44 <arosales> Ursinha: any update on reports for triage work?

 16:13:58 <arosales> Juju BPs

 16:14:06 <arosales> Charm release policy: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy

 16:14:07 <arosales> and

 16:14:14 <arosales> Charm Unit test: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:14:29 <arosales> SpamapS: I think you have made some progress on the release policy correct?

 16:14:32 <Ursinha> arosales, no updates now, maybe next week

 16:14:53 <arosales> m_3: I think you have also made some progressing on unit testing

 16:15:00 <arosales> Ursinha: ok, thanks

 16:15:14 <arosales> Openstack Juju Charms Next steps

 16:15:21 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-charms

 16:15:35 <arosales> adam_g: how are the openstack charms?

 16:15:59 <SpamapS> arosales: the release policy was merged and is part of the official documentation for juju now

 16:16:07 <SpamapS> arosales: implementing it is another story. :)

 16:16:20 <adam_g> arosales: they've been in sync with upstream development, but those TODOs are still TODO.

 16:16:36 <arosales> SpamapS: so 0% still valid for release policy

 16:16:41 <SpamapS> adam_g: we need to work on getting all of the actual openstack charms into the charm store, and having the CI tests running *off of those*

 16:16:46 <arosales> adam_g: ok, thanks

 16:16:52 <arosales> cloud-init

 16:16:59 <adam_g> SpamapS: im not sure that'll work, but we'll talk

 16:17:07 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils - smoser?

 16:17:16 <SpamapS> arosales: no I marked one of them DONE because the release policy is "done"

 16:17:22 <arosales> not a top priority, but at 0% so thought I would bring it up here

 16:17:28 <SpamapS> adam_g: if that won't work, then we should just dismantle the charm store. ;)

 16:17:33 <arosales> SpamapS: ok, thanks

 16:17:45 <smoser> arosales, i'll update that today.

 16:17:53 <arosales> smoser: ok thanks

 16:17:58 <arosales> and one last one for rbasak:

 16:18:03 <adam_g> SpamapS: they are forks of the upstream charm store charms, with lots of special sauce added for our environment. isn't that the point?

 16:18:06 <arosales> perhaps you can also comment smoser

 16:18:11 <SpamapS> adam_g: no, forking == fail

 16:18:14 <adam_g> adam_g: actively synced forks, i might add

 16:18:14 <arosales> apt

 16:18:17 <adam_g> er

 16:18:21 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-apt-improvements

 16:18:23 <adam_g> SpamapS: lets talk later

 16:18:27 <SpamapS> adam_g: yeah we will

 16:18:36 <arosales> apt BP also at 0%, but I know there is a spec out for review.

 16:18:54 <rbasak> I think we've more or less reached consensus on the broad plans for the apt improvements inside Ubuntu

 16:19:14 <rbasak> So now I need to get back to full steam ahead on testing my PoC, and on turning the current productions into something that is production ready

 16:19:18 <arosales> rbasak: good to hear, could you also follow up on the ARM BPs mentioned above?

 16:19:48 <rbasak> Sorry I was late to the meeting. I'll check the logs when they're published

 16:20:06 <arosales> rbasak: ok, thanks

 16:20:06 <arosales> utlemming: those are the 0% ones that I wanted to bring up. I realize some 0% is valid as we are working on the items but they can't be marked as done just yet.

 16:20:18 <arosales> utlemming: back to you

 16:20:38 <utlemming> #action everyone update their blueprint status

 16:20:38 * meetingology everyone update their blueprint status

 16:20:55 <utlemming> #topic Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:21:35 <utlemming> daviey: care to comment on the bug status?

 16:22:36 <utlemming> okay, moving on then....

 16:22:39 <utlemming> #topic 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:22:50 <utlemming> jamespage and smoser: how goes 12.04.1

 16:22:59 <arosales> utlemming: can we can come back to the bugs after 12.04.1 udpate

 16:23:04 <rbasak> I added a couple of bugs for tracking

 16:23:19 <smoser> hm.. well, there is plenty of work todo.

 16:23:20 <utlemming> arosales: yes sir

 16:23:36 <smoser> http://people.canonical.com/~jamespage/server-sru/precise-sru.html

 16:23:36 <jamespage> http://people.canonical.com/~jamespage/server-sru/precise-sru.html

 16:23:38 <jamespage> snap

 16:23:45 * jamespage lets smoser lead

 16:24:33 <rbasak> or at least I tried to add them. What is required to get bugs into the tracker?

 16:24:37 <smoser> well, given that list there, anything targetted, we really need to get cracking on

 16:24:52 <Daviey> utlemming: sorry, had a brown out.

 16:25:01 <smoser> juju and maas have a lot, that we're expecting an update for. those are the single largest things.

 16:25:18 <smoser> but if your name is on osomething there, or you think you can help, please take a bug and fix it.

 16:25:25 <smoser> ask someone to review and / or upload.

 16:25:26 <utlemming> Daviey: that was me yesterday...we'll come back to you after the current topic :)

 16:25:29 <Daviey> RE: maas.. currently in discussions how to do this.. it is making progress.

 16:25:34 <SpamapS> smoser: note that most of juju's were moved to precise-updates

 16:25:36 <smoser> jamespage, do you have any more "GET IT DONE!" like comments?

 16:25:48 <jamespage> smoser, I had a few specific bugs I would like to raise

 16:25:54 <smoser> please do.

 16:26:01 <jamespage> bug 858867

 16:26:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 858867 in cobbler (Ubuntu Quantal) "XMLRPC allows unauthed users access to various methods (which it shouldn't) " [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/858867

 16:26:16 <SpamapS> there's a security upload coming for juju, and then one more upload to proposed to fix a few of the more important things for 12.04.1

 16:27:05 <jamespage> this one has been kicked around for a while; as cobbler does not form part of our provisioning solution going forward should we really care about this for 12.04.1

 16:27:28 <jamespage> bug 988819 we just agreed to re-consider the approach

 16:27:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 988819 in mod-proxy-html (Ubuntu Precise) "[SRU] wrong path to libxml2.so.2 in mod_security - broken by multiarch enabled libraries" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/988819

 16:27:44 <SpamapS> jamespage: err.. maas in 12.04 needs it

 16:27:55 <smoser> for 858867, i had asked roaksoax to ask upstream about this.

 16:28:08 <jamespage> SpamapS, that really depends on '<Daviey> RE: maas.. currently in discussions how to do this.. it is making progress.'

 16:28:08 <zul> bug #990162 is a new one on the radar as well

 16:28:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 990162 in The Eilt project "armhf version is unusable -- task switches will cause sigsegv's" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/990162

 16:28:10 <smoser> we really should ask upstream what they recommend.

 16:28:38 <jamespage> and bug 975473

 16:28:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 975473 in MAAS "eliminate cobbler code copy" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/975473

 16:28:41 <roaksoax> smoser sorry i got delayed with maas stuff, i'll take care of it today

 16:28:55 <SpamapS> ah

 16:28:59 <rbasak> zul: 990162 is fixed in Quantal I hear? Is that confirmed?

 16:29:03 <roaksoax> jamespage: that is in progress, we might have something by EoW... but for quantal

 16:29:11 <zul> rbasak: yeah

 16:29:13 <roaksoax> (maas-provision / cobbler-copy)

 16:29:31 <jamespage> I guess targets for 12.04.1 still need to be agreed then.

 16:29:37 <zul> rbasak: quantal has a newer version, but the fix should be backported to precise

 16:30:04 <jamespage> zul, it would be good to get that webob SRU nailed as well.

 16:30:18 * rbasak marks it as Fix Released in Quantal

 16:30:18 <zul> jamespage: agreed ill spend some time on it tomorrow

 16:30:34 <jamespage> other than that I would say that we have already pushed through a large number of SRU's

 16:30:40 <Daviey> \o/

 16:30:48 <jamespage> well done!

 16:31:04 <arosales> nice :-)

 16:31:08 <rbasak> james_w: which one?

 16:31:27 <utlemming> okay, back Daviey

 16:31:29 <utlemming> #topic Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:32:05 <Daviey> So.. the page is empty for me.. it was working :)

 16:32:22 <arosales> so we are still working on bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 16:32:23 <Daviey> I'll investigate that

 16:32:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu Quantal) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Triaged]

 16:32:42 <arosales> hallyn: I saw a fix for that though . .  .

 16:32:44 <hallyn> stgraber was going to bring that up at the next foundations mt

 16:32:46 <hallyn> mtg

 16:34:49 <Daviey> shouldn't be super complicated

 16:35:06 <jamespage> note that touches kombu as well

 16:35:12 <zul> eh?

 16:35:36 <jamespage> to drop python-couchdb to universe we have to drop support from kombu

 16:35:44 <arosales> bug 1024408 also needs a volunteer :-)

 20:11:39 <czajkowski> so tell is about your loco, how things are done

 20:12:14 <toddy> we have a big loco with over 200 people in the group of the loco

 20:12:44 <toddy> and any more that are not organze in the loco group

 20:13:17 <toddy> we habe many groups (over 20) in Germany with have local meetings

 20:13:41 <czajkowski> nods

 20:13:45 <huats> impressive

 20:14:08 <toddy> we have every year a big meeting, this year in Berlin

 20:14:14 <toddy> the ubucon

 20:14:28 <czajkowski> well done on useing the LTP http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-de-locoteam/events/history

 20:14:35 <toddy> On LinuxTag in Berlin we have made a nice Ubuntu Lounge with couches and we have had the biggest booth of all projects.

 20:15:17 <czajkowski> toddy: how do you organise you taking part?  does everyone get involved ?

 20:15:38 <huats> do you have any idea of the attendance of the ubucon ?

 20:16:00 <toddy> everybody can be a member in one of the groups of the locoteam

 20:16:22 <czajkowski> toddy: can you explain a bit more about the groups

 20:16:27 <toddy> and the groups are member of the locoteam (the orga in lanchpad)

 20:17:06 <SergioMeneses> toddy, could you tell us more about ubuntu Deutschland e.V.?

 20:17:14 <toddy> huats: 200 till 250 people are every year at the ubucon

 20:17:21 <czajkowski> or if anyone else wants to talk please do

 20:17:27 <toddy> in berlin maybe more

 20:17:35 <SergioMeneses> 250 people!!! great

 20:18:01 <xdatap1> well done

 20:18:07 <itnet7> Great work

 20:18:10 <huats> great

 20:18:13 <toddy> czajkowski: there are different groups the ops of ubuntu-de (channel on freenode), the german portal ubuntuusers.de

 20:18:18 <Fuchs> czajkowski: the e.V. is a "eingetragener Verein", an organisational unit which helps you a lot in germany with legal, financial or logistical issues.

 20:18:21 <apollo13> SergioMeneses: what do you want to know about the e.V. -- it's mainly a legal base for out stuff

 20:18:24 <apollo13> our*

 20:18:31 <toddy> communtu, a built system for ubuntu, czajkowski

 20:18:51 <Fuchs> czajkowski: basically, if you want to have such a big organisation in germany you better register one of those, since else it's quite hard to manage. It is a legal entity and therefore also a contact point.

 20:18:55 <huats> I have another question : (2 actually) is juliux still involved ? and how have you done the ubuntu-eu transition ?

 20:18:56 <SergioMeneses> apollo13, it is only for support?

 20:19:03 <czajkowski> Fuchs: oh interesting

 20:19:13 <apollo13> SergioMeneses: no the e.V. is just for legal stuff, you can't do anything without it in germany

 20:19:14 <czajkowski> thanks for explaining

 20:19:18 <toddy> huats: yes juliux is still involved

 20:19:38 <toddy> huats: he is not here, couse he is at holiday

 20:19:44 <apollo13> huats: transistion from what to where, ubuntu-eu still exists ;)

 20:19:52 <huats> toddy: please say hi to him :)

 20:19:55 <apollo13> if you mean the server structure

 20:20:03 <toddy> huats: I will do that :)

 20:20:06 <huats> apollo13: that is what I meant :)

 20:20:24 <huats> since we had a  lot of team complaining with that

 20:20:24 <huats> :)

 20:20:33 <SergioMeneses> apollo13, Fuchs great

 20:20:34 <apollo13> SergioMeneses: for support there is ubuntuusers.de and mailinglists, that's also the reason why the page of the e.V. is pretty empty

 20:20:46 <SergioMeneses> apollo13, I see

 20:20:50 <Fuchs> (and the #ubuntu-de channel namespace)

 20:21:11 <czajkowski> ok, one last question, any issues you've had in the last 2 years and antying else we should know about ?

 20:22:07 <apollo13> issues? just that linux-mint people think an ubuntu forum is the perfect place to ask about mint issues -_- *scnr*

 20:22:18 <toddy> :D

 20:22:21 <MarkusH> :D

 20:22:23 <Lasall> hehe

 20:22:23 <svij> :D

 20:22:25 <itnet7> ;-)

 20:22:27 <SergioMeneses> apollo13, jaja

 20:22:36 <tomx3> We have had problems to get ubuntu-cds ;-)

 20:22:37 <czajkowski> *grin*

 20:22:47 <czajkowski> tomx3: in what way ?

 20:22:49 <toddy> yes, tomx3 that is correct

 20:22:55 <SergioMeneses> like what?

 20:23:08 <toddy> we have order loco-cds and we didn't get this cds

 20:23:14 <tomx3> czajkowski: juliux said that he has not got an answer to his order

 20:23:31 <czajkowski> but shipit people mailed recently and chased up on it, did you reply

 20:23:39 <toddy> and I have order too and I didn't get one cd

 20:23:52 <czajkowski> who is the team contact ?

 20:23:56 <czajkowski> and did they request it

 20:24:06 <toddy> juliux and me

 20:24:17 <czajkowski> hmm ok

 20:24:33 <czajkowski> toddy: can you please email shipit after the meeting and cc the loco council and we will chase up on it

 20:24:43 <czajkowski> I asked teams to do this last meeting also, but have not heard from them

 20:24:51 <czajkowski> I've no further questions
