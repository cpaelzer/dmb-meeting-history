 16:12:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 913694 in whoopsie-daisy (Ubuntu) "[MIR] whoopsie-daisy" [Undecided,In progress]

 16:12:16 <ev> (done)

 16:12:56 <ev> I will need a freeze exception, but I'm buried in interview prep work, so I'll sort that later tonight

 16:13:01 <stgraber> - Networking

 16:13:01 <stgraber> - Waiting on SRU test results for ifenslave/vlan/bridge, I'm told I should have these later today

 16:13:04 <stgraber> - Got daily IPv6 testing ported to regular bridge-utils so it can run within a container (yeah, container in containers)

 16:13:07 <stgraber> - Arkose

 16:13:10 <stgraber> - Updated the Arkose cli tool to show all the new features, did some minor bugfixing of the python module, updated translations and released 1.5

 16:13:13 <stgraber> - Friendly-Recovery

 16:13:15 <stgraber> - Updated menu landed, all options are always displayed now and switch from read-only to read/write is done when selecting an option requiring it

 16:13:19 <stgraber> - Still working on a 'system information' option, should land later today or early tomorrow

 16:13:21 <stgraber> - LTSP

 16:13:24 <stgraber> - Improve ltsp-live for Edubuntu

 16:13:26 <stgraber> - Lots of changes happening upstream to get the new shiny stuff ready by Feature Freeze. Testers are still busy and I expect an upload very shortly before FF.

 16:13:30 <stgraber> - Merged nbd from unstable to get some fixes needed for LTSP.

 16:13:32 <stgraber> - I've also started cleaning up the maintainer scripts and will spend some time to deal with our current installer bugs (ltsp-client-builder udeb)

 16:13:35 <stgraber> - Upstart

 16:13:38 <stgraber> - Tried to figure out why some jobs sometimes inherit an extra fd (a socket in this case), tracked down to something around libldap/libnss-ldap/libnss affecting

 16:13:41 <stgraber> machines using libnss-ldap. This was breaking LXC's upstart job, now fixed in LXC by having lxc-start close the extra fds.

 16:13:44 <stgraber> - Containers

 16:13:46 <stgraber> - Uploaded a new LXC with reworked template and Serge's patch to have our consoles and ttys in /dev/lxc, fixing upgrade/dist-upgrade in LXC for good. (bug 927519))

 16:13:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 927519 in lxc (Ubuntu) "makedev fails to upgrade in lxc container with error 'Device or resource busy'" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/927519

 16:13:49 <stgraber> - Updated shadow to add the new LXC consoles and ttys to securetty

 16:13:52 <stgraber> - Added a network-interface-container upstart job to ifupdown to simulate net-device-added for 'lo' in containers

 16:13:55 <stgraber> - Disable udevadm trigger --action=add in containers (bug 925122) - commited to the packaging branch, waiting on upstart to build on armel/armhf/powerpc.

 16:13:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 925122 in udev (Ubuntu) "container's udevadm trigger --add affects the host" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/925122

 16:13:58 <stgraber> - Other

 16:14:00 <stgraber> - Helped some friends of the LTTng project, sponsored the new LTTng2 stack (now in NEW) and filed the needed package removal bugs for the old broken stack

 16:14:03 <stgraber> - Will release pastebinit 1.3 later today, waiting for some extra translations at the moment

 16:14:06 <stgraber> (done)

 16:15:21 * slangasek runs out of breath reading ev's report

 16:15:50 <ev> hah

 16:16:15 <jhunt> ENOSPC over here! :)

 16:17:35 <slangasek> stgraber: huh, why does lxc need different names for its ttys?

 16:18:34 <stgraber> slangasek: lxc was bind mounting its ttys from outside the container to /dev/tty[1234] which is all fine, except when you deal with anything like udev/makedev/... which tries to move them, remove them, ...

 16:19:04 <stgraber> slangasek: so the easiest solution to fix it until we get a proper device namespace and can stop with the bind mounts was to use another location

 16:19:14 <slangasek> hmm, ok

 16:19:29 <slangasek> right, my turn

 16:19:33 <slangasek> * short week, was off Monday

 16:19:34 <slangasek> * interviewing

 16:19:34 <slangasek> * helping test/merge upstart fixes to be landed in precise today

 16:19:34 <slangasek> * resolvconf finagling

 16:19:34 <slangasek> * discussions about how to minimize future breakage from eglibc uploads

 16:19:36 <slangasek> * libnih1 uploaded for essential-ish pre-dependency issues

 16:19:38 <slangasek> * working with IS to get qemu-linaro situated to where it can be used as an emulated armel buildd running on top of a hardy VM

 16:19:41 <slangasek> * minor eglibc work

 16:19:44 <slangasek> * virtual sprint planning

 16:19:47 <slangasek> ..

 16:19:49 <slangasek> questions?

 16:20:36 <bdmurray> triage of bug 922330 regarding wubi installing precise

 16:20:36 <bdmurray> fixed lp_buttontags to make tagging bugs easier

 16:20:36 <bdmurray> modifications to lp-grab-attachments to download bugs about a project

 16:21:07 <bdmurray> ‚åÅ

 16:22:00 <cjwatson> Interviewing.

 16:22:00 <cjwatson> Another try at fixing ports installs (bug 919356).

 16:22:00 <cjwatson> Investigation of fixes for glibc 2.15 regressions.

 16:22:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 919356 in choose-mirror (Ubuntu) "Default hostname needed for PowerPC" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/919356

 16:22:12 <cjwatson> Added a mock GResolver to the ubiquity test suite to make it more reliable in various contexts (the powerpc build, stgraber's LXC setup).  Would have been much quicker except that https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669847 meant I had to do this in C.

 16:22:14 <ubottu> Gnome bug 669847 in gio "GSimpleAsyncResult introspection annotates methods as functions; unusable for creating results for errors" [Normal,Unconfirmed]

 16:22:16 <cjwatson> Clearing out http://lintian.ubuntuwire.org/tags/preinst-uses-dpkg-maintscript-helper-without-predepends.html.  Very slow and tedious, but everything is uploaded or has patches in a BTS somewhere now.

 16:22:20 <cjwatson> Made a pass through some outstanding team work items with Steve and postponed a few.

 16:22:23 <cjwatson> Tested transfer speed between cdimage and ftpmaster for foundations-p-image-build-pipeline.

 16:22:26 <cjwatson> Reorganised the ubiquity test suite to be able to run in a DEP-8-compliant package tester (i.e. testing the installed version of the package).

 16:22:29 <cjwatson> Working on a refactoring of how ubiquity removes about-to-be-copied files from the target system that fixes a slew of bugs and is more testable.

 16:22:32 <cjwatson> ..

 16:23:04 <jhunt> cjwatson: have we got the infrastructure to run DEP-8 tests yet?

 16:23:36 <cjwatson> autopkgtest exists; I don't know its current status, and we don't yet have it set up in a datacentre machine or anything

 16:23:57 <cjwatson> in theory should be a simple matter of sysadmin

 16:24:15 <jhunt> great as I'd like to be able to run the upstart tests in this way too.

 16:24:36 <cjwatson> You should be able to give autopkgtest a spin locally if you have time :)

 16:25:03 <slangasek> stgraber: this udev change would more than slow the boot, it would prevent events from being triggered entirely... this requires a versioned dep on upstart.

 16:25:31 <cjwatson> I admit I didn't actually try it out, merely ran the test in the appropriate environment under strace to ensure that it was testing the installed system and read the spec for the control file very carefully

 16:25:52 <jhunt> cjwatson: ok, ta.

 16:26:06 <slangasek> is the QA team involved with the autopkgtest discussions?

 16:26:11 <stgraber> slangasek: indeed, I'll add the versioned dep.

 16:26:51 <cjwatson> slangasek: there were QA people present at the appropriate UDS sessions, and jibel has a work item that came out of that; can't speak for after that

 16:27:01 <slangasek> stgraber: please check that such a versioned dep doesn't cause upgrade problems, too...

 16:27:29 <slangasek> cjwatson: ok

 16:28:11 <slangasek> cjwatson: just wondering if this is something that should be set up to run as part of the QA lab

 16:30:39 <cjwatson> eventually, yes; the blueprint calls for initial metadata to be added to a few key packages, and for something to be written that's able to feed it into a putative "should this be allowed to migrate from -proposed" tool

 16:30:48 * slangasek nods

 16:31:45 <slangasek> any other questions?

 16:32:30 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:33:29 <bdmurray> I've run across a couple this week worth discussing

 16:33:46 <bdmurray> Is bug 930304 something our team should fix?

 16:33:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930304 in eglibc (Ubuntu) "gdm is attempted to be reloaded even when not runnning" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930304

 16:34:01 <slangasek> yes

 16:34:22 <bdmurray> okay

 16:34:28 <slangasek> I'll probably wind up doing that one with my Debian eglibc committer hat

 16:34:39 <slangasek> (feel free to assign to me)

 16:34:51 <doko> ohh, nice =)

 16:35:17 <bdmurray> regarding bug 818760 should the timeout be increased or might it be something with the server?

 16:35:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818760 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager crashed with timeout in readline(): timed out" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818760

 16:35:33 <bdmurray> uri=urllib2.urlopen(req, timeout=20)

 16:35:34 <cjwatson> in principle it's always possible for network communication to fail for all kinds of reasons

 16:35:41 <bdmurray> from the traceback

 16:36:04 <cjwatson> u-m has to cope somehow without crashing

 16:36:26 <cjwatson> and preferably without stalling the UI forever while it tries to talk through a firewall that's dropping all its outbound packets, say

 16:37:17 <slangasek> right, so it needs to be fixed to not crash

 16:37:58 <bdmurray> got it

 16:39:37 <bdmurray> bug 926581 - that should have tasks for the meta package or the package manager?

 16:39:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 926581 in msttcorefonts (Ubuntu) "eula not shown when installed via restricted-extras" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/926581

 16:39:46 <mvo> (fwiw, this stuff should be running in a thread already, but indeed, it should not crash)

 16:40:46 <ev> ah, debconf. Can we set fire to it yet?

 16:40:54 <cjwatson> :-P

 16:41:12 <ev> :D

 16:41:15 <slangasek> no, but feel free to fix its protocol ;)

 16:41:26 <cjwatson> what's the protocol-level problem here?

 16:41:31 <slangasek> here? none

 16:41:40 <ev> sure, I'll just make it NOP every instruction

 16:41:43 <slangasek> but I was offering ev productive outlets for his anger ;)

 16:42:35 <ev> give me the source code to dpkg and hook me to a turbine. I'll power London with my rage. ;)

 16:42:40 <slangasek> bdmurray: seems like a synaptic problem

 16:42:59 <bdmurray> and software-center (that's what I tested)

 16:43:17 <bdmurray> er, not software-center

 16:43:20 <bdmurray> okay, thanks!

 16:43:23 <slangasek> oh

 16:43:27 <slangasek> sorry, read to fast

 16:43:35 <slangasek> I read comment 3 but didn't digest 4

 16:44:02 <bdmurray> well my grammar didn't help I'm sure

 16:44:45 <slangasek> that's a puzzling one

 16:44:52 <slangasek> anyone want to take a closer look at it?

 16:46:24 <slangasek> well, I'll have a peek then

 16:46:40 <slangasek> bdmurray: any other bugs?

 16:47:22 <bdmurray> just wubi bug 862003

 16:47:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 862003 in Wubi "wubi installs successfully but ends in 'permission denied' error due to the presence of a virtual or readonly drive; this only happens running wubi.exe standalone i.e. when installing using the tar.xz preinstalled image" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/862003

 16:48:48 <cjwatson> ... how's that Windows hire going? ;-)

 16:49:11 <slangasek> ... workin' on it

 16:49:16 <slangasek> add that bug to the queue :P

 16:49:58 <bdmurray> I'll have to make a queue but okay

 16:50:12 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:50:15 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:51:20 <ev> filing a freeze exception for the crash database stuff as mentioned above

 16:51:30 <ev> not a lot more work, just more than I think I'll manage tonight

 16:52:01 <cjwatson> the freeze is actually 2100 tomorrow, I believe

 16:52:22 <ev> yay, that buys me a bit more time

 16:52:26 <slangasek> :)

 16:52:42 <ev> should I request an exception, just in case, or is mentioning it here enough to make the release team aware that I'm cutting it close?

 16:53:02 <slangasek> it's already on Kate's list

 16:53:11 <slangasek> as a "late-landing change"

 16:53:25 <cjwatson> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/FeatureLanding

 16:53:29 <slangasek> yep
