 18:25:20 <stgraber> sorry if I'm a bit distracted, I'm being poked on a few channels at the moment ;)

 18:25:37 <stgraber> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Agenda

 18:25:55 <ajmitch> it's ok, I'm still trying to wake up :)

 18:25:57 <stgraber> #topic Apps which modify system settings (ubuntu-tweak, grub-customizer) -- AndrewMitchell

 18:26:57 <ajmitch> we had a brief discussion about this one in #ubuntu-arb yesterday, that we have some submissions which fiddle with the system (installing packages, touching files in /etc)

 18:28:01 <ajmitch> currently we have a general policy that such things aren't allowed, but there's no definitive place we can point people at for what's acceptable

 18:28:15 <wendar> that's true

 18:28:26 <wendar> there's the early documents, but it's not a clear list

 18:28:36 <wendar> it would be better to have one page

 18:28:39 <stgraber> right, I think we should go with a whitelist on that rather than a blacklist

 18:28:42 <ajmitch> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Review has some of our other rules, PostReleaseApps/SecurityChecklist has a whole lot more

 18:29:24 <wendar> stgraber: I like that, it has a more positive tone

 18:29:27 <stgraber> along the lines of is allowed to write to an app specific directory in the user's home directory and can use gconf/gsettings to affect desktop settings if that's the result of a user's direct action in the UI and is revertable

 18:29:28 <ajmitch> I'd like to be able to reject those apps with a good response, and get information on developer.ubuntu.com linking to what we'll accept

 18:30:19 <highvoltage> stgraber: pong

 18:30:26 <stgraber> I don't want an app that starts messing in gconf/gsettings when it opens without it being a visible opt-in switch

 18:30:54 <ajmitch> alright

 18:31:23 <ajmitch> you've probably seen that there's a fair discussion on ubuntu-desktop about ccsm & related apps

 18:31:42 <wendar> indeed

 18:32:45 <stgraber> indeed and I'm not necessarily against apps like that in extras, but they shouldn't do anything by default, make it clear to the user about what will be changed when they click something and ensure that reverting the change works

 18:33:04 <stgraber> (so effectively, that'd be a no-go for ccsm as the part about reverting changes doesn't seem to work too well ;))

 18:33:09 <ajmitch> unfortunately ubuntu-tweak is a bit of a kitchen sink, it adds/removes packages & manages PPAs as well

 18:33:36 <stgraber> right, ubuntu-tweak is a clear no-go if only for its use of gksudo, touching /etc and adding repositories

 18:34:02 <stgraber> we don't even allow packages in the archive to add PPAs (well, except the packaging tools themselves) :)

 18:34:08 <highvoltage> stgraber: so is ccsm being dropped from the archive?

 18:34:24 <ajmitch> highvoltage: as it stands, it's likely

 18:35:01 <Pendulum> Before you drop it can someone see how much work it's going to be to make the screen magnifier accessible in other ways? (including the options to set type of zoom and level of zoom)

 18:35:04 <ajmitch> grub-customizer has an open debian ITP, so probably better to help the author get it in there

 18:35:35 <stgraber> highvoltage, Pendulum: it might get dropped, anyway, that's not a discussion for the ARB to have, please discuss it on the mailing lists :)

 18:35:38 <ajmitch> Pendulum: we're not the ones dropping it, we're trying to sort out what's acceptable for extras.ubuntu.com

 18:35:51 <Pendulum> ajmitch: okay, couldn't tell who was making the final decision. Sorry!

 18:36:18 <wendar> ajmitch: yes, agreed grub-customizer is better through the Debian process

 18:36:32 <stgraber> ajmitch: right, I don't believe grub-customizer would be suitable for the ARB, so we should indeed drop it and help get it in Debian

 18:36:42 <ajmitch> ok, I'll try & put aside some time for that & tell them in the rejection email :)

 18:37:31 <ajmitch> so as a general rule, the AppReviewBoard/Review page is a good place to put the guidelines about what an app can do?

 18:38:27 <wendar> ajmitch: It might be worth creating a simple AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines page

 18:38:36 <ajmitch> alright

 18:38:37 <wendar> that's just a list of "what we accept"

 18:39:25 <ajmitch> I can add that, and a canned response on the Responses page

 18:39:48 <stgraber> that'd be grat, thanks

 18:39:52 <stgraber> *great

 18:40:13 <wendar> awesome, thanks!

 18:40:32 <stgraber> #action ajmitch to reply to grub-customizer and have the packaging process continue in Debian

 18:40:32 * meetingology` ajmitch to reply to grub-customizer and have the packaging process continue in Debian

 18:40:56 <ajmitch> stgraber: thanks, you're quicker than I am :)

 18:40:58 <stgraber> #action ajmitch to work on AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines (basic list of guidelines for app going to extras.u.c and some canned responses)

 18:40:58 * meetingology` ajmitch to work on AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines (basic list of guidelines for app going to extras.u.c and some canned responses)

 18:41:37 <stgraber> I guess based on that page we can then go through the queue and do some mass rejection? (not sure how many we have but at least ubuntu-tweak should be rejected)

 18:41:56 <ajmitch> there shouldn't be too many

 18:42:40 <stgraber> good

 18:42:47 <stgraber> #topic Complexity criteria of app submissions

 18:43:06 <stgraber> so to quote what I said yesterday on IRC

 18:43:28 <stgraber> 23:46 < stgraber> 15:41 <stgraber> I believe they are basically "no bundled libraries" (which gets us rid of 99% of the java stuff) and "no more code than a human can reasonably  read and  understand in an hour"

 18:43:46 <stgraber> (yeah, I've been copy/pasting that one a few times ;))

 18:44:09 <wendar> no bundled libraries at all?

 18:44:11 <ajmitch> we did allow bundling some libraries if necessary, last time we sorted out rules

 18:44:26 <ajmitch> just not bundling updated copies of what's in the archive

 18:44:32 <wendar> like, if a python game uses a couple of self-written objects for data?

 18:44:37 <wendar> ah, yes agreed

 18:44:39 <ajmitch> certainly not bundling .jar files though :)

 18:44:44 <highvoltage> that sounds very nice, especially for the arb reviewers, but wouldn't that make it hard to ship games?

 18:45:03 <stgraber> if the "library"/"module" is part of the upstream code, fine

 18:45:25 <stgraber> I just don't want to have apps containing bundled external libraries in their code

 18:45:27 <highvoltage> (actually, scratch that, I was thinking of things like Oil Rush, but that's not even an ARB app in the first place)

 18:45:36 <stgraber> because it becomes a security/bugfix/legal nightmare pretty quickly

 18:45:47 <wendar> yup, we don't want to be maintaining that

 18:47:05 <stgraber> not sure how we want to word it in the guidelines, but the idea is that we'd reject anything that bundles libraries/modules/whatever that can be found as a separate entity (so outside of the upstream project)

 18:47:41 <wendar> We can word it mostly positively

 18:49:00 <wendar> You can include any libraries that are part of your app, for example...

 18:50:04 <stgraber> yeah, we should try to be a bit positive about it (though it's a bit difficult to make that kind of criteria positive ;)).

 18:50:13 <wendar> If your app depends on external libraries, please make sure that your app runs on the current versions shipped in Ubuntu.

 18:50:27 <ajmitch> it's also hard to make "your source is too big" positive :)

 18:50:41 <wendar> (that implies a negative, but states it as a positive)

 18:50:43 <stgraber> I'm sure we'd have submissions arguing on the "are part of your app" part saying that their upstream "source" tarball contains all these .jar and so it's "part of their app" :)

 18:51:06 <stgraber> wendar: +1 for that one

 18:51:08 <ajmitch> stgraber: fine, but we also have requirements that the app be buildable from source, afaik

 18:51:39 <stgraber> ajmitch: indeed, which is why we should have rejected all of these with bundled .jar a long time ago

 18:51:40 <ajmitch> the page links to the licensing policy which requires full source

 18:52:02 <ajmitch> yeah, I should have rejected those that I've seen, sorry

 18:52:46 <wendar> ajmitch: How about something like "Our focus is on lightweight apps. To give you a general idea, we're looking for the kind of apps that could be reviewed in about an hour reading through the code."

 18:53:03 <ajmitch> wendar: that sounds good

 18:53:15 <stgraber> wendar: that in addition to the "If your app depends on external libraries, please make sure that your app runs on the current versions shipped in Ubuntu." would be great

 18:53:22 <ajmitch> an hour might be a little too lightweight, but it's a start

 18:53:42 <wendar> yeah, I could see spending a couple of hours

 18:53:52 <wendar> it's just to give them a rough guideline

 18:54:12 <stgraber> with review here meaning just scanning through the code and figuring out what the app does, in that hour I didn't count licensing review or any actual testing of the app and packaging

 18:54:16 <wendar> (and programmers always underestimate, so if we say one hour, we'll probably get 5)

 18:55:11 <ajmitch> There's an empty page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines if you want to put them there

 18:55:32 <stgraber> wendar: can you add these two to the guidelines?

 18:55:52 <wendar> yes, will do

 18:57:06 <stgraber> #action wendar to update AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines to include a note on bundling libraries and complexity (review time) criteria

 18:57:06 * meetingology` wendar to update AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines to include a note on bundling libraries and complexity (review time) criteria

 18:57:21 <stgraber> #topic General status of the ARB queue

 18:57:59 <stgraber> so the queue still looks pretty long

 18:58:35 <ajmitch> it seems like the budapest sprint knocked a few off the list, and you've done a good job with getting some lenses in

 18:59:03 <ajmitch> I'm trying to find spare time to focus on 1 or 2 apps at a time & try & get them through

 18:59:11 <highvoltage> if there's something I should/could look at let me know

 18:59:28 <ajmitch> highvoltage: 'all of the above'? :)

 18:59:55 <stgraber> I'm not sure all the changes that were listed on the mailing list by non ARB members have been applied to the queue (these from Daniel and Michael), would be good to make sure they didn't do these reviews for nothing

 19:00:11 <ajmitch> the myapps page looks to be sorted by submission date (or ID) now

 19:00:51 <stgraber> ajmitch: seems to be by ID

 19:01:27 <ajmitch> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/app-review-board/2012-January/000274.html

 19:01:36 <ajmitch> ^ dholbach's reviews

 19:01:43 <wendar> which would end up being by submission date, since they're auto-incrementing

 19:02:12 <ajmitch> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/app-review-board/2012-January/000314.html

 19:02:18 <ajmitch> ^ mvo's reviews

 19:03:02 <stgraber> wendar: right, by initial submission date, not by last submission (which is shown as the Since. column)

 19:03:55 <ajmitch> doesn't really matter about the particulars of the sorting, I was more suggesting we work from the top down, to get the oldest ones moving

 19:04:01 <stgraber> highvoltage: can you look at these two e-mails and make sure the changes have been sent through myapps?

 19:04:17 <highvoltage> stgraber: ok, I can do so tomorrow

 19:04:48 <stgraber> #action highvoltage to make sure Daniel and Michael's review have been sent through MyApps

 19:04:48 * meetingology` highvoltage to make sure Daniel and Michael's review have been sent through MyApps

 19:04:51 <wendar> stgraber: aye, I guess last submission could be useful for watching what's been updated

 19:05:13 <stgraber> wendar: indeed

 19:05:56 <stgraber> anything else about the queue?

 19:06:18 * ajmitch has nothing more to add at the moment

 19:06:24 <stgraber> Just a quick reminder to not touch the PendingQA ones, hopefully these will be moved to published soon (still waiting for the updated software-center)

 19:06:27 <ajmitch> voting on the list seems to be a good way to do it

 19:07:16 <stgraber> at the moment we need to use some hybrid MyApps/package metadata hack to get things to show up on the software-center, so before uploading a package to extras.ubuntu.com, please let me know and I'll make sure everything is right

 19:07:21 <stgraber> #topic Chair for next meeting

 19:07:25 <ajmitch> ok

 19:07:27 <stgraber> any volunteer?

 19:08:01 <highvoltage> ok I'll bite

 19:08:08 * ajmitch can do it, with sufficient caffeine

 19:08:10 <stgraber> #action highvoltage to chair the next ARB meeting

 19:08:10 * meetingology` highvoltage to chair the next ARB meeting

 19:08:22 <stgraber> #topic AOB

 19:08:25 <stgraber> anything else?

 19:08:36 <ajmitch> none from me

 19:09:04 <highvoltage> nope, exhausted busy conferencing :)

 19:09:05 <ajmitch> just a general note that filing bugs on developer-portal can be useful if there are things that annoy you about myapps

 19:09:14 <highvoltage> (or from too much pizza)

 19:09:42 <stgraber> #endmeeting
