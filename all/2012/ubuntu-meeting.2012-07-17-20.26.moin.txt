 20:30:27 <huats> so is there anyone from ubuntu-pe ?

 20:30:32 <JoseeAntonioR> Yeah, it's me

 20:30:33 <JoseeAntonioR> Hello, guys! I'm Jose Antonio Rey, and I'm the team contact for Ubuntu-PE. Our Reapproval Application is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PeruvianTeam/ReapprovalApplication2012. Any questions you have, please ask them, and I'll gladly answer them.

 20:30:38 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: :)

 20:30:47 <huats> anyone else ?

 20:30:52 <SergioMeneses> hello JoseeAntonioR

 20:30:57 <huats> hey JoseeAntonioR

 20:30:57 <JoseeAntonioR> hmm, nope, everyone's at work

 20:31:00 <czajkowski> yay photos!

 20:31:01 <huats> ok

 20:31:04 <JoseeAntonioR> :P

 20:31:12 <huats> Where is nxvl ???

 20:31:23 <JoseeAntonioR> huats: at work

 20:31:29 <huats> pfff

 20:31:32 <SergioMeneses> huats, working

 20:31:34 <SergioMeneses> I guess

 20:31:38 <huats> I know he don't want to talk to us

 20:31:39 <huats> ;)

 20:31:50 <SergioMeneses> huats, jeje

 20:32:16 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: thanks for coming, so I was wondering, is there any reason why the loco doesn't use the LTP more ? http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-pe/events/history and is there plans to use it more in the future?

 20:33:15 <JoseeAntonioR> czajkowski: Yep, we've stopped a few months ago as we had a problem (I will talk about that later, I think you already know it), and all meetings/events were announced via ML

 20:33:33 <JoseeAntonioR> We're re-starting to use it, we have a couple events in there

 20:33:38 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: can you elaborate more as to the issues please

 20:34:45 <JoseeAntonioR> Sure. A few months ago, I came into Ubuntu-PE, and found out our team was pretty inactive. That was because the team leader stopped working. So, I took initiative and got everyone to work again. In that while, the team was fully inactive except by some people making announcements via the ML and some chit-chat in the IRC channel.

 20:35:12 <SergioMeneses> I testified about that!

 20:35:17 <JoseeAntonioR> That's why you may find some empty logs in irclogs.ubuntu.com, and, as you said, it seems we've stopped using the LoCo Portal.

 20:35:59 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: thanks

 20:36:20 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: so how do you plan to get people involved and keep the activity going?

 20:37:25 <JoseeAntonioR> czajkowski: well, we've got meetings every month, and we've got a couple activities in the upcoming weeks. When we have talks/booths/conferences/whatever, we announce it via ML and get volunteers to work with us, personally, in getting more people involved with the project, so we keep growing and growing.

 20:37:45 <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: ok

 20:37:50 <JoseeAntonioR> We're also planning on starting a couple Ubuntu Hours, and contacting local FLOSS teams to talk to them about Ubuntu.

 20:37:52 <czajkowski> thanks for answering

 20:37:58 <SergioMeneses> JoseeAntonioR, I wanna know more about the future goals!

 20:38:58 <JoseeAntonioR> Sure! We've got lots of invitations to different events. There is where we're going to help people to get involved with the project. They are presented to Ubuntu, and told to join the LP team and all resources.

 20:39:14 <JoseeAntonioR> Once we've done that, we contact them, and start planning what we'll be doing in the meanwhile.

 20:39:34 <huats> ok great action !

 20:39:37 <JoseeAntonioR> By now, we've got some plans, as getting Ubuntu in local stores. There are PCs with Ubuntu, but the amount is minimal.\

 20:39:47 <SergioMeneses> JoseeAntonioR, perfect!

 20:39:59 <huats> Ok I think we are ready to vote then !

 20:40:02 <huats> #startvote

 20:40:03 <JoseeAntonioR> We're also trying to get people involved with translations and development. We offer mentoring if necessary, to get them to reach the member status.

 20:40:03 <JoseeAntonioR> Sure

 20:43:59 <huats> Gwaihir: you are not even living in Italy !!!

 20:44:01 <huats> :)

 20:44:14 <Gwaihir> yeah... blame on me :-)

 20:44:19 <czajkowski> nice #link http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-it/events/history

 20:44:59 <huats> I have a question

 20:45:03 <huats> youj mention the RAI3

 20:45:07 <Gwaihir> huats, sure

 20:45:16 <huats> what are your experience with press ?

 20:45:18 <huats> and medias ?

 20:45:25 <Gwaihir> yeah, that is an old interview

 20:45:30 <huats> are you able to communicate on a large scale ?

 20:45:36 <Gwaihir> experience is ups and lows

 20:45:54 <czajkowski> 27 Ubuntu members :o WOW

 20:46:07 <huats> (is t is not a tricky question I am just curious)

 20:46:13 <Gwaihir> sometimes we are able to reach big names in the press, sometimes it is harder, but we have some good people trying to reach out them as much as we can

 20:46:39 <huats> ok GwaihirI think we are all facing the same difficulties

 20:46:41 <Gwaihir> usually for every release we have a release press article that we send out, sometimes it is picked up

 20:47:05 <Gwaihir> yeah, I guess it is hard, need to make a lot of good contacts, but it is not easy

 20:47:05 <czajkowski> Gwaihir: does the team face any issues as you're rather large ?

 20:47:24 <Gwaihir> czajkowski, not really, we are rather large, but the team is well structured

 20:47:39 <Gwaihir> we have different working teams that are more or less independent

 20:47:53 <czajkowski> Gwaihir: can you tell us about the structure please?

 20:47:54 <Gwaihir> so they do not strictly depend on our Council

 20:48:01 <jokrebel> bye

 20:48:13 <Gwaihir> we have a similar structure to the international community

 20:48:22 <Gwaihir> we have a Community Council

 20:48:43 <Gwaihir> plus small working teams, specialized in their field

 20:49:03 <Gwaihir> a translation team, a doc team, form admins and staff, developers, testers and so on

 20:49:09 <Gwaihir> s/form/forum

 20:49:11 <czajkowski> nods

 20:49:12 <xdatap1> graphical schema of the italian team: http://www.ubuntu-it.org/comunita

 20:49:25 <czajkowski> aww that is rather cute

 20:49:28 <SergioMeneses> xdatap1, nice

 20:49:30 <czajkowski> Gwaihir: Team reports ?

 20:49:39 <Gwaihir> they basically sets up themselves as they need to, we just watch other in the beginning

 20:49:53 <Gwaihir> czajkowski, ah... we actually are not really good at that

 20:49:59 <czajkowski> Gwaihir: :(

 20:50:01 <huats> Gwaihir: hum....

 20:50:07 <huats> I am so disapointed

 20:50:22 <czajkowski> Gwaihir: is that something perhaps the team could work on

 20:50:25 <huats> I won't say it aloud since I want to spend nice holidays in italy in 2 weeks

 20:50:32 <Gwaihir> we tried to have single teams write small reports and then re-wrote them in the team report page, but didn't work nice

 20:50:34 <huats> but you should work on that

 20:50:44 <Gwaihir> huats, indeed, we have to

 20:50:52 <czajkowski> ok am ready to vote

 20:53:07 <huats> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RussianTeam/ReApprovalApplication2012

 20:53:14 <ghosthost> great!

 20:53:15 <huats> Is thre anyone from russia ?

 20:53:19 <ghosthost> yes

 20:53:19 <Agafonov> o/

 20:53:24 <yurau> o/

 20:53:27 <Malamut> yes

 20:53:30 <huats> Thanks for joining us

 20:53:43 <huats> Who will speak to present your activity ?

 20:54:01 <SergioMeneses> hello ubuntu russia!

 20:54:03 <yurau> Agafonov will

 20:54:08 <czajkowski> Agafonov: hey there

 20:54:19 <Agafonov> I was workking to geather application, so yes

 20:54:53 <huats> Agafonov: great we are listening to you :)

 20:54:58 <czajkowski> yay photos make me happy

 20:55:09 <huats> are there any points you want to specifically present ?

 20:55:10 <czajkowski> #link http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ru/events/history

 20:55:53 <Agafonov> please note we are big country and it is really hard to be a loco as a one single team

 20:56:14 <Agafonov> so there many teams involved in activity

 20:56:30 <czajkowski> Agafonov: ah ok, so do you think the Russian loco would benefit from being broken up into smaller locos like USA for example ?

 20:56:38 <yurau> we dont know english )

 20:56:49 <SergioMeneses> Agafonov, I like the community numbers, but what is Vkontakte LoCo?

 20:56:51 <Malamut> czajkowski: I don't think so

 20:56:53 <Agafonov> some are doing things we are really do not know :)

 20:57:23 <Agafonov> vkontakte is a big russian social network

 20:57:29 <ghosthost> please, don't say I about all of us, yourau :)

 20:57:37 <ghosthost> *it

 20:58:01 <Agafonov> regarding breakage - there are some teams already in your list

 20:58:19 <Agafonov> http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ru-loco-spb

 20:58:25 <Agafonov> for example

 20:58:26 <SergioMeneses> Agafonov, I think so but it is a great number of members

 20:58:41 <czajkowski> well it would mean areas that are active and went for approved loco would get stuff like cds and other areas that werent could work wtih approved areas and maybe share resoources

 20:58:50 <Agafonov> most are users :)

 20:59:20 <Malamut> well, we have some very active teams in some cities, but in general there is not enough active members((

 20:59:24 <czajkowski> so what do you see as the issues for the russian loco ?

 20:59:42 <Agafonov> not enough *active* members

 21:00:09 <czajkowski> ok, and do you have any plans to change this ?

 21:00:20 <Agafonov> this is a question of leadership more or less...

 21:00:23 <Malamut> czajkowski: one global team to help regional subteams

 21:00:30 <Malamut> czajkowski: yes, of cource
