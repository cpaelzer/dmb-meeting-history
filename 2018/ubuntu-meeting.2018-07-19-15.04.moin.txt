 15:16 <cyphermox> #topic http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-cc-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:16 <cyphermox> mostly point-release

 15:17 <cyphermox> anything point-release related we need to dsicuss?

 15:17 <bdmurray> juliank: Have you looked at bug 1766890 any more?

 15:17 <ubottu> bug 1766890 in gnome-menus (Ubuntu) "package gnome-menus 3.13.3-6ubuntu3.1 failed to install/upgrade: triggers looping, abandoned" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1766890

 15:18 <juliank> bdmurray: Not really yet. Was about to restore apt-clone and try some stuff, but not done yet

 15:18 <juliank> Could add a Pre-Depends somewhere I guess, but sounds a bit scary too

 15:18 <bdmurray> juliank: Okay, I think I still have that vm running if you need some logs

 15:19 <juliank> Basically I'd try adding a Pre-Depends _somewhere_ so that stuff gets configured in two runs

 15:19 <juliank> but it might do more harm than it helps

 15:20 <juliank> With systemd fixed, we could set Immediate-Configure to 0, and it _should_ work

 15:20 <juliank> Regression potential being that if the upgrade fails, essential packages will be unconfigured too

 15:21 <bdmurray> That seems worse

 15:21 <juliank> s/will/might/

 15:22 <juliank> Well, they are designed to work unconfigured.

 15:22 <juliank> But we did hit bug 1771791

 15:22 <ubottu> bug 1771791 in systemd (Ubuntu Cosmic) "Need to pre-depend on stuff used by systemctl, so systemctl works in other package's preinst" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1771791

 15:23 <cyphermox> #topic Any Other Business?

 15:23 <bdmurray> sil2100: Do you need any help with SRU stuff?

 15:24 <sil2100> bdmurray: not sure, I'll still be looking at the xenial queue later today but from bionic I'll only look at u-u

 15:24 <sil2100> Didn't see anything there critical for .1

 15:25 <bdmurray> What about all the noawait changes?

 15:25 <juliank> I think we do want all of those in before 18.04.1 is released

 15:26 <juliank> But that's mostly in xenial

 15:26 <sil2100> bdmurray: for bionic I guess all landed?

 15:26 <bdmurray> I think infinity mentioned testing upgrades with them

 15:26 <sil2100> bdmurray: ah, ok, I see guile-2.2 there

 15:26 <juliank> guile-2.2 will be needed for 18.04->18.10 and later only I think

 15:26 <bdmurray> Does doing an upgrade test seem worthwhile?

 15:28 <juliank> Well, I would not expect it to regress w/ trigger changes

 15:28 <cyphermox> we all good?

 15:29 <bdmurray> Sure, we can talk about this elsewhere.

 15:29 <cyphermox> well, if it's AOB relevant to the meeting it would be good to have it in minutes

 15:29 <cyphermox> 18.04.1 and upgrading qualifies I think ;)

 15:30 <bdmurray> I'll test an upgrade just in case.

 15:30 <cyphermox> #endmeeting!
