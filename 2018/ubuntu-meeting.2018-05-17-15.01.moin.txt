 15:16 <slangasek> questions over status?

 15:16 <sil2100> No questions from me

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:17 <slangasek> anything we need to look at today for bugs?

 15:17 <slangasek> (presumably in 18.04 SRU rather than 18.10, at this point?)

 15:18 <bdmurray> rbalint was concerned about bug 1767875 and a couple more like it

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1767875 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/update-manager:ValueError:restart_icon_renderer_data_func:pkg_requires_restart:__get_candidate" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1767875

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1767876

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1767876 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/update-manager:ValueError:foreach_cb:is_selected:marked_install" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1767876

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1768780

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1768780 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/update-manager:ValueError:foreach_cb:<listcomp>:packages_are_selected:is_selected:marked_install" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1768780

 15:18 <bdmurray> oh and bug 1768782

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1768782 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/update-manager:ValueError:pkg_toggle_renderer_data_func:is_selected:marked_install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1768782

 15:19 <bdmurray> juliank: you know what needs to happen here right?

 15:19 <rbalint> bdmurray, i fixed the similar errors in u-u

 15:20 <rbalint> bdmurray, basically not keeping references to python objects becoming invalid, just keeping package names in u-m

 15:20 <juliank> bdmurray: um, it's a bit complex I think

 15:21 <juliank> But yes, basically just keep name/version/id or something and use that

 15:21 <juliank> s/id/hash/

 15:21 <rbalint> imo we should take this bug because it totally breaks upgrades

 15:23 <bdmurray> I just upgraded packages today

 15:24 <bdmurray> This specific bucket has 12k instances https://errors.ubuntu.com/problem/d9c36d9ae61a1fcae2f3f442e0b43890c93a262f

 15:24 <bdmurray> So it seems like we should get on fixing it.

 15:28 <bdmurray> Okay, so we'll create a card and getting it prioritized quickly.

 15:28 <rbalint> +1

 15:29 <gaughen> +1

 15:29 <bdmurray> I've also seen a few bugs like bug 1768905 regarding triggers being unprocessed.

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1768905 in menu (Ubuntu) "package menu 2.1.47ubuntu2 failed to install/upgrade: dependency problems - leaving triggers unprocessed" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1768905

 15:29 <bdmurray> dpkg: dependency problems prevent processing triggers for menu:

 15:29 <bdmurray> menu depends on libstdc++6 (>= 4.6); however:

 15:29 <bdmurray> Package libstdc++6:amd64 is not configured yet

 15:36 <slangasek> well, ubuntukylin and ubuntu-mate both ship menu, so I guess we should care about that

 15:37 <juliank> I'm more worried about the ordering bug

 15:37 <juliank> in general :D

 15:37 <bdmurray> Me too!

 15:40 <bdmurray> There are also a couple of friendly-recovery bugs.

 15:40 <bdmurray> One has a patch, bug 1766872 and the other I haven't recreated.

 15:40 <ubottu> bug 1766872 in friendly-recovery (Ubuntu) "'Enable Network' in recovery mode not working in Bionic" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1766872

 15:41 <bdmurray> I mean I just haven't tried.

 15:41 <bdmurray> Bug 1767685

 15:41 <ubottu> bug 1767685 in friendly-recovery (Ubuntu) "recovery mode: recovery-menu linke 75: file or directory not found" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1767685

 15:46 <xnox> bdmurray, it's mine, it's in progress.

 15:46 <xnox> bdmurray, let's move on.

 15:47 <bdmurray> That's it then.

 15:49 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:50 <rbalint> LP: #1770224 is something i can't workaround in u-u

 15:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1770224 in apt (Ubuntu) "unattended-upgrades crashes with: apt_pkg.Error: E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1770224

 15:50 <xnox> maybe postpone this one for next week?

 15:50 <rbalint> but i was late :-)

 15:51 <slangasek> ok deferred for now, thanks

 15:51 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:51 <cyphermox> no ob from me

 15:51 <gaughen> nothing from me
