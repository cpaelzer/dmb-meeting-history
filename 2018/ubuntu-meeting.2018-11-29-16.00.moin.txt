 16:15 <vorlon> questions over status?

 16:16 <vorlon> [TOPIC] Bugs

 16:16 <vorlon> bdmurray:

 16:17 <bdmurray> bug 1805183

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1805183 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "systemd-resolved constantly restarts on Bionic upgraded from Xenial" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1805183

 16:17 <vorlon> hmm

 16:19 <bdmurray> I haven't investigated it but it might be worth having someone look at.

 16:20 <vorlon> agreed, putting it in the queueu

 16:20 <bdmurray> I had bug 1591427 languishing in some forgotten tab and tested it again with the 18.04 server, not subiquity, iso and was able to recreate it.

 16:21 <ubottu> bug 1591427 in pkgsel (Ubuntu) "Installer gives user option to deactivate automatic updates, yet automatic upgrade of security packages are on by default" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1591427

 16:21 <bdmurray> Maybe its not worth investigating with the move to subiquity.

 16:21 <juliank> wgat's the option doing?

 16:22 <bdmurray> -security is setup in Unattended-Upgrades Allowed-Origins

 16:23 <bdmurray> which conflicts with "no automatic updates"

 16:24 <vorlon> I think in terms of overall expected experience, the bug is in pkgsel's description of the option, not in the behavior

 16:24 <rbalint> i think the debconf question being ignored causes that

 16:24 <vorlon> i.e. we don't want the user to have an option in d-i that actually disables automatic security updates

 16:25 <bdmurray> ah, that makes sense

 16:25 <rbalint> the fix in LP: #1577215

 16:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1577215 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu) "Origin pattern is unexpected on dpkg-reconfigure" [Low,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1577215

 16:25 <vorlon> (so probably medium-low priority bug on the non-default installer)

 16:26 <bdmurray> cyphermox: is there any reason to keep you assigned?

 16:26 <sil2100> eh...

 16:26 * sil2100 forgot about the meeting again

 16:26 <cyphermox> wat?

 16:26 <sil2100> I'm bad with meetings this week

 16:26 <bdmurray> if you were paying attention you'd know you were assigned. ;-)

 16:26 <vorlon> sil2100: hi :) want to give us status after bdmurray finishes up?

 16:27 <sil2100> I'll prep one real quick

 16:27 <cyphermox> well, if someone else wants to do the pksel part of it

 16:27 <bdmurray> bug 1803786 I gess we should just do it

 16:27 <ubottu> bug 1803786 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "ubuntu-support-status should report 10 years of support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1803786

 16:28 <vorlon> uh

 16:28 <vorlon> the 5 years beyond the 5 years is ESM

 16:28 <rbalint> is this public?

 16:28 <vorlon> so I don't think that should be advertised in ubuntu-support-status as the support length?

 16:28 <bdmurray> there's a url in the bug

 16:30 <vorlon> commented now on the bug, disagreeing with the proposed change

 16:30 <bdmurray> well the quote in the blog is misleading then as it doesn't mention ESM

 16:30 <vorlon> yes

 16:32 <chiluk> As someone on the outside, I had no clue it was just ESM.

 16:33 <chiluk> Good luck with that communication.

 16:33 <vorlon> https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2018/11/16/%23ubuntu-release.html#t19:24

 16:34 <rbalint> so it is not official really

 16:35 <bdmurray> bug 1797335 looks interesting

 16:35 <ubottu> bug 1797335 in glibc (Ubuntu) "strstr() on ubuntu18.04 8 times slower than on ubuntu16" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1797335

 16:35 <juliank> wow

 16:35 <doko> that's open for a long time, untouched.

 16:36 <bdmurray> 2 months isn't a long time in Launchpad

 16:38 <bdmurray> Okay so somebody will comment on that bug then, yes?

 16:39 <vorlon> I guess so :)

 16:40 <bdmurray> bug 1801439 is the last one

 16:40 <ubottu> bug 1801439 in software-properties (Ubuntu) "Unable to add software sources via the software-properties" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1801439

 16:42 <bdmurray> that seems worth taking on

 16:44 <rbalint> bdmurray, the software-properties-qt is in universe

 16:44 <rbalint> does -gtk work ok?

 16:45 <bdmurray> I suspect it'll fail but will test it create a card if needed.

 16:45 <bdmurray> that's it

 16:46 <sil2100> Should I just paste my status update?

 16:47 <rbalint> i'm already on twisted

 16:47 <doko> currently doing java-common

 16:47 <doko> anyone automake-1.16? s390x only

 16:48 <doko> and ubuntu-image?

 16:49 <sil2100> I'm looking at ubuntu-image, I *fixed* it

 16:49 <sil2100> I mean, still might need some re-runs here and there

 16:49 <gaughen> sil2100, did you find some rand?

 16:49 <sil2100> But I did the 'xnox' thing to get rid of the py36 env thing

 16:49 <sil2100> gaughen: not yet!

 16:51 <doko> sil2100: then please give back the tests (I did it now for the pyyaml trigger)

 16:51 <vorlon> sil2100: yes; is that your status?

 16:54 <sil2100> * Iterated on the cosmic image, making it build on livefs, pushing out missing fixes

 16:54 <sil2100> * Iterating on the bionic image, finding missing pieces and making it build the image

 16:54 <sil2100> * Checking on the spamming of firmware messages on the console on bionic
