 15:18 <gaughen> ha

 15:18 <cyphermox> no Qs.

 15:19 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:19 <slangasek> bdmurray: anything to discuss?

 15:19 <bdmurray> bug 1574351

 15:19 <gaughen> oh yes

 15:19 <ubottu> bug 1574351 in perl (Ubuntu) "package libperl5.22 5.22.1-9 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite shared '/usr/share/doc/libperl5.22/changelog.Debian.gz', which is different from other instances of package libperl5.22:i386" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1574351

 15:19 <bdmurray> Its been around for a bit and seems to still be an issue on bionic

 15:19 <juliank> eww

 15:19 <slangasek> interesting

 15:20 <slangasek> people are installing !amd64 libperl?

 15:20 <bdmurray> I thought I saw a bug about installing some printer drivers maybe.

 15:20 <slangasek> ah

 15:20 <slangasek> so that's "easy", just requires fixing the package build so that the changelog is compressed reproducibly

 15:20 <bdmurray> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/perl/+bug/1770682

 15:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1574351 in perl (Ubuntu) "duplicate for #1770682 package libperl5.22 5.22.1-9 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite shared '/usr/share/doc/libperl5.22/changelog.Debian.gz', which is different from other instances of package libperl5.22:i386" [High,Confirmed]

 15:21 <slangasek> +1, worth fixing

 15:21 <bdmurray> Well that wasn't helpful. "Scanner driver failed to install"

 15:21 * juliank looks at libperl in cosmic

 15:21 <juliank> it's broken too

 15:22 <bdmurray> okay, I'll card it for 18.04.1. What queue should it go in?

 15:22 <slangasek> bdmurray: gen distro

 15:22 <slangasek> bdmurray: I wouldn't consider it 18.04.1-critical however, if it's been outstanding for this long

 15:22 <bdmurray> ack

 15:22 <rcj> bug 1775219 bdmurray? I don't think the hack is appropriate so I'm looking to know if an error message change could be made.

 15:22 <ubottu> bug 1775219 in apport (Ubuntu) "incorrectly reports package as unsupported if apt cache is empty" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1775219

 15:23 <bdmurray> rcj: for what release?

 15:23 <bdmurray> rcj: an error message change seems reasonable

 15:24 <rcj> cosmic to start but I'd hope for an SRU back to bionic and xenial.  All the cloud images clear out the package lists to save space so they're all affected until first refresh

 15:24 <rcj> bdmurray: thx

 15:24 <rcj> bug 1775291 (forgot to add coreutils until today)

 15:24 <ubottu> bug 1775291 in coreutils (Ubuntu) "'df /dev/sda1' (rootfs) returns result for /dev on gce minimal images" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1775291

 15:24 <bdmurray> rcj: And an apt update isn't run after install? I think a ubiquity install does an update on first boot.

 15:25 <rcj> bdmurray: apt update isn't run until first unattended upgrade window (otherwise we'd hammer cloud mirrors when people spin up many VMs)

 15:26 <bdmurray> rcj: okay, fair enough.

 15:26 <rcj> bug 1775291 (forgot to add coreutils until today)  This is an oddity seen on minimal images slangasek

 15:26 <ubottu> bug 1775291 in coreutils (Ubuntu) "'df /dev/sda1' (rootfs) returns result for /dev on gce minimal images" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1775291

 15:26 <bdmurray> rcj: What are you looking for there?

 15:26 <slangasek> rcj: is that because we're booting initramfsless?

 15:27 <slangasek> right, description confirms

 15:27 <slangasek> so, that's cool

 15:27 <bdmurray> xnox: Could you have a look at bug 1767299.

 15:27 <ubottu> bug 1767299 in partman-auto (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu 18.04 Installer creates swap partition too small" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1767299

 15:27 <rcj> we've worked around it in our testing but it's odd behavior.  df says / is /dev/root but mount still says /dev/sda1.

 15:27 <slangasek> yeah

 15:27 <rcj> So when you 'df /dev/sda1' it gives you /dev

 15:27 <slangasek> that's a tough one

 15:27 <rcj> (closest match)

 15:28 <slangasek> so, I guess we should dig into it, we don't want initramfsless cloud images to have broken df behavior

 15:28 <rcj> yeah, and I was surprised 1) by the change in behavior and 2) by the mount/df difference

 15:28 <slangasek> I'm not sure if coreutils is the right way to fix it

 15:28 <gaughen> slangasek, is it a release blocker?

 15:28 <slangasek> I wouldn't say so

 15:28 <gaughen> k

 15:28 <rcj> sorry, I found it with 'df' so I opened on coreutils.  But brought it up here because I'm not sure where it should go.

 15:30 <slangasek> rcj: yeah, reasonable place to start

 15:30 <slangasek> so, probably worth taking into the backlog

 15:31 <slangasek> any other bugs?

 15:31 <bdmurray> bug 1771845

 15:31 <ubottu> bug 1771845 in grub-installer (Ubuntu) "grub-installer raid handling code missing nvme from sed filter" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1771845

 15:32 <bdmurray> cyphermox: ^^

 15:36 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll create a card for that for 18.04.1

 15:36 <slangasek> oh is that the root cause? neat

 15:36 <bdmurray> xnox: bug 1651818 is assigned to you

 15:36 <ubottu> bug 1651818 in cryptsetup (Ubuntu) "busybox-initramfs needs different compile options to work with cryptroot-unlock" [Low,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1651818

 15:36 <bdmurray> someone also added a patch to that fwiw

 15:37 <slangasek> I've been aware of that bug and it warrants fixing, but also AFAIK it doesn't impact any configurations that you arrive at via our installer?

 15:38 <bdmurray> Ah, I see xnox's comment, #3, about that now.

 15:39 <bdmurray> So let's skip that one.

 15:39 <bdmurray> doko: are you aware of bug 1663280?

 15:39 <ubottu> bug 1663280 in glibc (Ubuntu Zesty) "Serious performance degradation of math functions" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1663280

 15:42 <bdmurray> let's have infinity take a look at that one

 15:43 <bdmurray> slangasek: that's all I have

 15:43 <slangasek> ok

 15:43 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:43 <slangasek> anything else today?

 15:43 <bdmurray> I'll be out tomorrow
