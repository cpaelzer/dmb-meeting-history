 15:14 <cyphermox> glorry?

 15:14 * xnox can't spell

 15:14 <rbalint> xnox: can't spel :-)

 15:15 <xnox> cyphermox, basically yeah it lies when responding to EDNS0 queries... with valid EDNS0 responses.... which are wrong

 15:15 <xnox> i guess it trips up on D0 bit set to zero....

 15:15 <cyphermox> cool

 15:15 <cyphermox> #topic http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:16 <cyphermox> what do we need to discuss here? should we wait for our fearless leaders?

 15:16 <bdmurray> That's the wrong release

 15:16 <cyphermox> oops

 15:17 <cyphermox> #topic http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:17 <bdmurray> bug 1759732 is new

 15:17 <ubottu> bug 1759732 in partman-auto-crypto (Ubuntu) "[Lubuntu] Having zram support means that encrypted LVM installs don't work" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1759732

 15:17 <cyphermox> I thought we had fixed this before last release?

 15:18 <cyphermox> or some similar issue with encrypted

 15:18 <cyphermox> oh, nevermind I guess it was crypted swap

 15:19 <cyphermox> anyway, seems like reshuffling zram appropriately in partman-auto-crypto is the right thing to do

 15:19 <bdmurray> so worth taking then?

 15:19 <cyphermox> my opinion is yes, but I shouldn't be signing up the team alone.

 15:20 <cyphermox> I can certainly fix this, I know about this issue

 15:20 <bdmurray> Okay, let's take it then.

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1756595 seems like something worth fixing right?

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1756595 in apport (Ubuntu) "disk space info inadvertently provides all installed snaps" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1756595

 15:21 <cyphermox> err

 15:21 <cyphermox> df is doing what it's supposed to

 15:22 <cyphermox> do we do anything special for other such mountpoints

 15:22 <nacc> server team suggested (internally) maybe it should exclude some paths / mountpoints by regex

 15:22 <bdmurray> I haven't looked to see if it does

 15:23 <xnox> we had some regexeps in the past, to e.g. exclude things from Unity sidebar, nautilus, etc.

 15:23 <cyphermox> xnox: sure, but this is df, not some graphical thing

 15:23 <nacc> well it'd be in apport, no?

 15:24 <cyphermox> nacc: what do you mean?

 15:24 <cyphermox> when you look at df, you're supposed to look at the whole line, not just "oh is this 100%"

 15:24 <nacc> cyphermox: the regex in this case, would be in apport -- it could simply not show the snap paths

 15:24 <nacc> cyphermox: right, but would the snap paths ever be relevant to apport?

 15:24 <cyphermox> oh, I see

 15:24 <cyphermox> for apport, sure, but it might actually be relevant to some bugs

 15:25 <nacc> right, the above bug was against apport (based upon the bot)

 15:25 <rbalint> maybe we can skip loop devices in general, too

 15:25 <cyphermox> ie. "I'm running xyzzy, but it blows up" and it turns out the user has both the deb package and the snap installed?

 15:25 <nacc> cyphermox: wouldn't `snap list` output be the same?

 15:25 <nacc> dunno if we grab that

 15:25 <cyphermox> do we do that?

 15:25 <nacc> :)

 15:25 <nacc> bdmurray: --^ ?

 15:26 <cyphermox> I don't see extra lines in df output in an apport crash report being all that much an issue

 15:26 <cyphermox> more info, as long as it's not identifying info, is potentially helpful to fix a bug

 15:26 <nacc> yeah, me  neither

 15:27 <cyphermox> bdmurray: your opinion as bug master?

 15:27 <cyphermox> or should we just take the bug and decide later?

 15:27 <bdmurray> It'd be easy to fix so lets decide later.

 15:27 <cyphermox> great

 15:28 <bdmurray> I'm going to target bug 1756446 no discussion necessary.

 15:28 <ubottu> bug 1756446 in whoopsie (Ubuntu) "Include JournalErrors.txt" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1756446

 15:28 <cyphermox> +1

 15:28 <rbalint> how about this line appearing:  /dev/loop23 102144 102144 0 100% /snap/tinder/23 ?

 15:29 <bdmurray> yes, I think that'd be surprising

 15:29 <rbalint> nevermind, discuss later

 15:29 <bdmurray> I think that's it for bugs

 15:30 <cyphermox> #topic AOB

 15:30 <cyphermox> anyone?

 15:30 <bdmurray> There are some holidays approaching right?

 15:30 <cyphermox> yeah

 15:30 <cyphermox> I'm off friday, and all of next week

 15:31 <tdaitx> there's a holiday tomorrow, but I will swap it

 15:31 <rbalint> i'll be off tomorrow and on Monday, too

 15:31 <fginther> I'm out Friday and Monday (see the calendar)

 15:32 * juliank too

 15:32 <cyphermox> cool

 15:32 <cyphermox> well, happy Easter, for those who celebrate it

 15:33 <cyphermox> that's it

 15:33 <cyphermox> ?
