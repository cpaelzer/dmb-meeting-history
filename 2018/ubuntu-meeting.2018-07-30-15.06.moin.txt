 15:06 <meetingology> Meeting started Mon Jul 30 15:06:16 2018 UTC.  The chair is jbicha. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:06 <meetingology> 

 15:06 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:06 <blackboxsw> hello hello rbasak

 15:06 <blackboxsw> yep, just back from 2 week vacation o/

 15:06 <slashd> jbicha, I can chair the next one, I never did it yet.

 15:06 <tsimonq2> I can take the one after that then.

 15:07 <jbicha> * cyphermox to sort out ML / IRC channel accesses

 15:07 <jbicha> I believe that's all taken care of

 15:08 <jbicha> #topic Package Set / Per Package Uploader Applications

 15:08 <jbicha> #subtopic blackboxsw requesting PPU for cloud-init & curtin

 15:09 <jbicha> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChadSmith/DeveloperPerPackageUploadApplication

 15:09 <blackboxsw> thanks jbicha.

 15:09 <jbicha> blackboxsw: could you start by introducing yourself? :)

 15:09 <blackboxsw> certainly...

 15:10 <blackboxsw> I'm a member of the Canonical server team and work closely with Scott Ryan and Josh as primary contributors of cloud-init and curtin  upstream

 15:11 <blackboxsw> I've been at Canonical since Nov 2011 and worked with Landscape, Charm Curtin and cloud-init

 15:11 <blackboxsw> sorry typo..  Landscape, maas juju, openstack curtin and cloud-init in my time here.

 15:12 <blackboxsw> I love system management problems and improving enterprise software to make it easier to use and understand.

 15:12 <blackboxsw> I've been exclusively on the ubuntu server team since Apr 2017 I believe and focused solely on cloud-init and curtin.

 15:13 <blackboxsw> prior to Canonical I was at HP in the open source and linux lab setting up system management on HP Itanium and ProLiant as well as HP cloud infrastructure(devops)

 15:14 <blackboxsw> also, a soccer fan, and former competitive ultimate frisbee player  :)

 15:14 <jbicha> blackboxsw: I'm looking at https://launchpad.net/~chad.smith/+uploaded-packages and I see 2 uploads for cloud-init (and SRUs) and 2 for curtin

 15:15 <blackboxsw> jbicha: that view only shows latest of any packege/series  since Debian's retirement of alioth  we couldn't search upload history well for ubuntu packages so I wrote a script to help folks

 15:15 <slashd> jbicha, there is more than that here: https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Chad+Smith&sponsoree_search=name

 15:15 <jbicha> I think normally the DMB expects more sponsored uploads before granting direct upload rights

 15:15 <blackboxsw> it's linked from my proposal let me get it

 15:15 <blackboxsw> and please feel free to use the script :)

 15:15 <blackboxsw> for others since that app is dead

 15:15 <blackboxsw> jbicha: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChadSmith/PackageUploads

 15:16 <blackboxsw> I thought about writing a simple web microservice to host basically the same querystring search terms as the old   ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi which no longer exists

 15:17 <blackboxsw> I may get to that soon, but vacation got in the way :)

 15:17 <blackboxsw> ahh thanks for th enew link for ubuntu-sponsorships.... I thought it was dead and gone

 15:18 <blackboxsw> sorry,  launchpad seems to limit the uploaded-packages view to only the latest release per series

 15:18 <blackboxsw> slashd: I hadn't known about that app showing up. thanks

 15:18 <slashd> blackboxsw, yw

 15:19 <blackboxsw> hey ahasenack

 15:19 <ahasenack> fly on the wall

 15:19 <slashd> blackboxsw, can you tell me a few thing things you would look at as a sponsor before uploading a patch in the upload queue and why ?

 15:22 <blackboxsw> slashd: I'm all about tooling and generating documented, repetitive results. So, most of the work I'm doing for cloud-init and curtin is to improving tooling and automated documentation around our SRU upload process. Limit our SRU exceptions by making our automated and manual testing  simpler and faster so we can cover more integration friction points

 15:24 <blackboxsw> I've started extending tooling to allow us to launch instances on various clouds for integration testing, improved our customer visible documentation content on cloudinit.readthedocs.orc and curtin.readthedocs.org and been the primary driver and test validation developer during most of the last 5 cloud-init srus.

 15:24 <blackboxsw> what I'm hoping to do is keep smoser out of the equation when we actually have to physically upload the bits after SRU validation has passed on all platforms. :)

 15:25 <blackboxsw> we can't have a single point of failure on curtin or cloud-init and I want to allow us to have more than one person who can fix the products of critical public-facing issues arise

 15:26 <blackboxsw> in case someone gets sick. which scott never does :)

 15:27 <slashd> blackboxsw, good where would you look for a package stuck in -proposed for more than 2 weeks for instance ?

 15:28 <blackboxsw> also, I've started building a history of our SRU validation tests which help us better collect and document scripts developed to test certain feature aspects and results  so we can leverage them into some of our automated tooling.   https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/tree/master/20180620

 15:28 <blackboxsw> I collect that content for each SRU so when we get enough use-cases we can develop integration tests that cover certain features in our  CI.

 15:29 <tsimonq2> blackboxsw: After slashd's question, where would you go to look if an SRU has regressed and has not been fully phased in?

 15:29 <blackboxsw> slashd: not sure if you were asking about queues

 15:29 <blackboxsw> I generally check the following during SRU process: ttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=cloud-init

 15:29 <blackboxsw> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=cloud-init    for each series under test

 15:30 <slashd> blackboxsw, the package has is built in -proposed, verification-done-$RELEASE, the 7 days waiting is done, but package doesn't move into -update for instance

 15:30 <blackboxsw> if something was stuck there I'd bing in ubuntu-devel channel so ask for assistance

 15:30 <blackboxsw> I normally also look over the age and related bugs @ https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html

 15:30 <slashd> blackboxsw, thanks

 15:30 <tsimonq2> blackboxsw: Thanks.

 15:31 <blackboxsw> for each series I've targeted, make sure that I've tagged those bugs accordingly once I finish attaching validation results

 15:31 * rbasak has a couple of questions when you're ready

 15:32 <blackboxsw> so I thought there was an sru regresson tag like sru-verification-failed if I did hit a regression bug during testing

 15:32 <blackboxsw> like"verification-failed-$RELEASE"

 15:32 <blackboxsw> per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates

 15:34 <blackboxsw> tsimonq2: was that your question? I would tag it sru-verification-failed to ensure it didn't get phased in.

 15:34 <blackboxsw> or just the pending-sru.html dashboard as the place to validate status of a queued sryu

 15:34 <blackboxsw> or just the pending-sru.html dashboard as the place to validate status of a queued sru

 15:34 <blackboxsw> rbasak: fire away

 15:34 <tsimonq2> blackboxsw: Correct, but let's say an SRU team member lets it into -updates. It goes through a phasing process before actually being landed to all users.

 15:35 <tsimonq2> Where do you find the status of that?

 15:35 * rbasak holds on

 15:35 <blackboxsw> ahh. I actually don't know where to look for that

 15:36 <blackboxsw> rmadison tells me once package has actually published to -updates... but hmm

 15:37 <tsimonq2> blackboxsw: For future reference, https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/phased-updates.html and http://www.murraytwins.com/blog/?p=127 are worth looking into.

 15:37 <tsimonq2> That's it for me.

 15:37 <blackboxsw> I can find that the package is in accepted state in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+queue?queue_state=4&queue_text=cloud-init   ... but hmm

 15:37 <jbicha> blackboxsw: btw, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Phasing

 15:37 <blackboxsw> ahh good deal, bookmarking now thanks tsimonq2

 15:37 <tsimonq2> jbicha's link too; that's where I got to both links.

 15:38 <rbasak> blackboxsw: how would you handle a feature release to cloud-init that happens after feature freeze in Ubuntu?

 15:39 <blackboxsw> since cloud-init has an SRU exception, I would go through the exception testing process for cloud-init documented here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CloudinitUpdates

 15:40 <blackboxsw> if it is a large changeset, not a single cherry pick of a bug, I would create an SRU process bug like the following...

 15:40 <blackboxsw> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1777912

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1777912 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Bionic) "sru cloud-init (18.2-4-g05926e48-0ubuntu1) to (18.3-9ubuntu1)" [Medium,Fix committed]

 15:41 <blackboxsw> within it we have to capture any ubuntu-specific functional changes made from a documentation standpoint

 15:42 <blackboxsw> minimally we allow CI to cover most cases (which integration tests on lxd,ec2 and kvm platforms, and we manually integration test  on platforms like : azure, gce,  openstack

 15:43 <blackboxsw> I do clean install and  upgrade testing on each platform to make sure we don't have regresssions during that process for instances or 'pets' which are upgraded

 15:43 <blackboxsw> *new* instances or 'pets'

 15:44 <tsimonq2> blackboxsw: What about in the development release of Ubuntu, prior to it being declared stable?

 15:44 <blackboxsw> after verification is done and all logs attached to the SRU bug pass, we request validation from MAAS and CDOQA

 15:46 <blackboxsw> there's an exception process that we went through this last time I thought. I'll see if I can dig that up. in this case for IBM we had a bug that needed fixing after bionic transitioned after feature freeze.

 15:46 <blackboxsw> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess

 15:48 <rbasak> OK, thanks. Second question: have you ever done an SRU that isn't a backport from a latest upstream release? Or a development upload that isn't a new upstream release?

 15:48 <blackboxsw> so the FFE required an FFE bug and then a resulting set of verification steps.

 15:50 <blackboxsw> rbasak: I believe I've been involved in at least two cloud-init SRUs that were cherry picks of individual bugs backported to a given series. there was content in tip that we didn't want to leak back to xenial or artful  as it changed behavior.

 15:50 <blackboxsw> we have tooling in both cloud-init and curtin to support cherry picks or upstream snapshots very easily

 15:51 <rbasak> blackboxsw: would you be able to find me an example of one of those uploads please?

 15:51 <blackboxsw> depending on the need. but for all of the content we currently allow into tip/trunk we make sure we develop a simple config switch or enable tiny patch to allow the default behavior of a feature to be preserved in the stable releases.

 15:52 <smoser> 17.2-35-gf576b2a2-0ubuntu1~16.04.2

 15:52 <blackboxsw> rbasak: cloud-init (18.2-4-g05926e48-0ubuntu1~16.04.2) xenial-proposed; urgency=medium

 15:52 <rbasak> Thanks

 15:53 <blackboxsw> my version was IBM specific changes into xenial

 15:53 <blackboxsw> trying to find others

 15:53 <blackboxsw> thanks smoser

 15:54 <blackboxsw> true and smoser's was a break that a community contribution  introduced into Google's datasource which dropped all user-data :/

 15:54 <blackboxsw> so we had to patch that up quick and didn't want to leak all of tip into xenial

 15:54 <jbicha> blackboxsw: maybe a bit off-topic, but… I'm familiar with cloud-init but could you explain more about what curtin is for? it's not installed by default in Ubuntu Server, is it?

 15:56 <blackboxsw> jbicha: curtin is a simple/fast installer for ubuntu onto baremetal, it's primary consumer at the moment is maas.

 15:56 <smoser> (if you search for 04.2 at https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/tree/debian/changelog?h=applied/ubuntu/xenial-devel you'll see many of Chad's cherry-pick uploads)

 15:56 <blackboxsw> it allows you to quickly configure network and storage and deploy ubuntu images very quickly as well as passthrough additional cloud-init configuration to the target machine

 15:57 <jbicha> thanks, I haven't really used MAAS much :)

 15:57 <jbicha> last call for questions…

 15:58 <blackboxsw> also it's used by the subiquity installer too (again that'll be under-the-hood for most users).

 15:59 <jbicha> ok

 16:01 <tsimonq2> jbicha: You probably have to set the people that can vote first.

 16:01 <rbasak> blackboxsw is technically my colleague, though we don't cross paths much (working in different areas). I intend to follow my usual method of abstaining unless there is a unanimous vote and I need to vote to make quorum.

 16:02 <jbicha> +1

 16:02 <meetingology> +1 received from jbicha

 16:02 <blackboxsw> heh s/curtain/curtin :)

 16:02 <jbicha> blackboxsw: I told you I wasn't familiar with it! 😳 thanks

 16:03 <blackboxsw> we'll have to get broader market adoption.... I'll add it to my list ;)

 16:04 <tsimonq2> I would typically abstain because I don't already have upload access to these packages myself, but since I think we're short enough people on the DMB for this meeting, I'll go ahead and vote.

 16:12 <ahasenack> congrats blackboxsw

 16:12 <blackboxsw> as always I'll continue to lean on you all if there are questions that arise ;) thanks for all the help in the past

 16:12 <jbicha> this will also grant you Ubuntu membership

 16:13 <jbicha> any volunteers to handle adding him to the appropriate groups and setting up the PPU?

 16:13 <rbasak> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/KnowledgeBase#Actions_after_a_successful_application is what is needed.

 16:13 <rbasak> I'll be happy to do it.

 16:14 <jbicha> #action rbasak to handle setting up PPU for blackboxsw

 16:14 * meetingology rbasak to handle setting up PPU for blackboxsw

 16:15 <jbicha> #topic MOTU applications

 16:15 <jbicha> Unit193's application is deferred until the next meeting.

 16:15 <jbicha> Please see the discussion on the list about the pseudonym concern. I think we'll want that to be resolved, at least for Unit193's case, by that meeting.
