 16:17 <bdmurray> that which?

 16:23 <slangasek> huh, incoming queue is looking quite large

 16:24 <slangasek> update-manager-text?  do-release-upgrade's ugly cousin?

 16:24 <bdmurray> So I wonder if we should just drop it.

 16:24 <slangasek> I agree

 16:25 <bdmurray> So target and card it?

 16:26 <slangasek> yes

 16:26 <slangasek> (inprogress)

 16:26 <slangasek> (done)

 16:26 <bdmurray> I ran into bug 1749036 during a partial upgrade

 16:26 <ubottu> bug 1749036 in e2fsprogs (Ubuntu) "package libcomerr2 1.43.8-2 failed to install/upgrade: libcomerr2:all 1.43.9-1 (Multi-Arch: no) is not co-installable with libcomerr2 which has multiple installed instances" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1749036

 16:27 <xnox> didn't infinity fix it?

 16:27 <slangasek> sounds like it; infinity to close out the bug

 16:28 <bdmurray> bug 1747711 seemed like something we might want to keep an eye on

 16:28 <ubottu> bug 1747711 in file (Ubuntu) "file mis-identifies modern executables as application/x-sharedlib" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1747711

 16:31 <slangasek> bdmurray: it doesn't seem important to me; am I missing something?

 16:31 <bdmurray> slangasek: No, probably not.

 16:32 <slangasek> "Consequently, only non-PIE executables can be opened in graphical file managers such as nautilus" - I don't think that's a common method for opening programs on a modern desktop

 16:32 <slangasek> declining then

 16:32 <bdmurray> Also when I tested with nautilus I didn't see that behavior.

 16:33 <slangasek> bdmurray: should LP: #1749199 have an assignee?

 16:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1749199 in upstart (Ubuntu) "purge conf files on removal of upstart (was session fails to start after an upgrade from xenial to bionic)" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1749199

 16:33 <xnox> i've hit that bug

 16:34 <bdmurray> then you sound like a good candidate for fixing it!

 16:37 <slangasek> ok, I think we should take this for bionic

 16:38 <slangasek> interestingly I don't have those here

 16:38 <slangasek> oh because I purged

 16:40 <slangasek> LP: #1512322

 16:41 <slangasek> taking

 16:44 <bdmurray> it looks like rbalint is working on bug 1698159 already

 16:45 <rbalint> yep

 16:45 <bdmurray> slangasek: so should we target that then?

 16:45 <rbalint> need the apt-side fix however, too

 16:45 <rbalint> imo the apt-side part is more important

 16:46 <bdmurray> is that something juliank is aware of?

 16:46 <rbalint> the u-u part comes as part of kernel autoremoval - and protecting running kernel

 16:46 <juliank> I vaguely recall something about that

 16:47 <slangasek> agreed that we should take it

 16:47 <bdmurray> okay

 16:47 <slangasek> the patterns in the generated /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels just need to be updated to include linux-cloud-tools-foo

 16:47 <juliank> We can fix that in the next apt upload, that should just be some line added in the conf file with the proper regex :-)

 16:47 <slangasek> /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal

 16:48 <juliank> No, /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove

 16:48 <juliank> needs linux-cloud-.* I guess as VersionedKernelPackages

 16:48 <juliank> Well, I guess both works

 16:49 <juliank> We use that for headders, and linux tools, too, though, so it's probably the right location

 16:50 <slangasek> juliank: ah, you're right, /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove, I was vague on the specifics of where the code lived

 16:51 <slangasek> I think that's enough within bugs, shall we move on?

 16:51 <bdmurray> sure

 16:51 <rbalint> slangasek: i have a candidate

 16:51 <rbalint> LP: #1737441

 16:51 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1737441 in python-apt (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/unattended-upgrade:11:__GI___libc_free:operator:__gnu_cxx::new_allocator:std::allocator_traits:std::__cxx11::basic_string" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1737441

 16:51 <rbalint> i'm hitting it frequently now in u-u testing

 16:52 <rbalint> like 2 out of 3 runs when upgrading a lot of packages

 16:54 <slangasek> ok, taking

 16:55 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:55 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:55 <bdmurray> I'll likely be out tomorrow

 16:56 <slangasek> #endmeeting
