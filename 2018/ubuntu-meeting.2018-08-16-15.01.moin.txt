 15:12 <slangasek> and sil2100 is out

 15:12 <slangasek> any questions?

 15:13 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:13 <slangasek> bdmurray: ?

 15:14 <bdmurray> jibel tagged bug 1704510 for us

 15:14 <ubottu> bug 1704510 in partman-efi (Ubuntu) "Partman should warn about not having an EFI system partition" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1704510

 15:15 <juliank> Didn't we ensure this does not happen in bionic?

 15:15 <juliank> or did we only look at automatic stuff?

 15:16 <slangasek> well, that bug is older than our changes

 15:16 <cyphermox> no, this sounds exactly like what sil2100 was changing

 15:16 <cyphermox> yup

 15:16 <slangasek> so maybe jibel wants to give us a fresh bug report

 15:17 <bdmurray> okay, I'll follow up with him

 15:18 <bdmurray> Then bug 1772374

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1772374 in OEM Priority Project "ubiquity need mount point /sys/firmware/efi/efivars" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1772374

 15:19 * cyphermox to jfdi

 15:19 <bdmurray> That's all from me.

 15:20 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:20 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:21 <bdmurray> when was bug 1704510 fixed?

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1704510 in partman-efi (Ubuntu) "Partman should warn about not having an EFI system partition" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1704510

 15:21 <bdmurray> There are some recent duplicates of it so I'm curious about what version it was fixed in.

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: before 18.04.1

 15:22 <slangasek> looking for version

 15:23 <slangasek> bdmurray: I think ubiquity 18.04.14.3

 15:24 <tdaitx> not sure this counts as a bug (as in I'm using i3wm instead of the default wm), but keyboard-configuration generated a bogus keyboard config for my system when it migrated to /etc/default/keyboard

 15:25 <tdaitx> I'm still taking a look at its migration scripts to understand what happened

 15:27 <slangasek> is that a recent migration? I don't recall where it was before

 15:29 <slangasek> tdaitx: anyway, I don't think there's anything that should be wm-specific about that, please file a bug report

 15:30 <tdaitx> slangasek: ack, just wondering as other desktops usually have their own tool to deal with keyboard model/layout/etc

 15:30 <slangasek> tdaitx: sure, perhaps that masks the bug on those desktops, but /etc/default/keyboard shouldn't be invalid

 15:31 <tdaitx> slangasek: the new file is dated 10th August, so I'm assuming it is a recent one, I rebooted recently then I noticed that keyboard was 'broken' on X and console

 15:31 <tdaitx> still looking into that

 15:36 <slangasek> anything else? :)
