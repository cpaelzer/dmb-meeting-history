 12:10 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 18 December 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:10 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:10:28 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:10 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:11 <Wild_Man> Gyuseok, you are up first

 12:11 <Wild_Man> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 12:12 <Gyuseok> yes I agree

 12:12 <Wild_Man> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:13 <Wild_Man> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:13 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 12:13 <Wild_Man> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:14 <Wild_Man> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:15 <Wild_Man> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:15 <Wild_Man> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:16 <Wild_Man> #topic Gyuseok

 12:16 <Wild_Man> topic Gyuseok

 12:17 <Wild_Man> So, first up we have Gyuseok, could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement, and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad account…

 12:18 <Gyuseok> hello

 12:18 <Gyuseok> I'm Gyuseok, I joined the Ubuntu Korea community in 2019 and have been in charge of infrastructure since then, and I'm also involved as an event organizer, starting with Ubucon Asia 2021.

 12:20 <mapreri> Hello Gyuseok !

 12:21 <Gyuseok> Hello mapreri

 12:23 <Wild_Man> Please stand by while the board members review the details you've provided, and then I'll invite them to ask any questions they may have

 12:24 <mapreri> I have a question for you: do you see yourself being involved more in the international community side?  I.e., LoCo Council, docs, other ubuntu.com things too, besides "only" Asia?

 12:24 <mapreri> big props for taking part in organizing events btw! ♥

 12:25 <Gyuseok> I also want to be active in the international community, but most of my activities these days are focused on the LoCo.

 12:26 <mapreri> ack, thank you.

 12:46 <mapreri> 0 - I think I would prefer to see some more clear contributions, and stronger testimonials here.  And perhaps some wider continued involvement in the community besides mostly discourse.
