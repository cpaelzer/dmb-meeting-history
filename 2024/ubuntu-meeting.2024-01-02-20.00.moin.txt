 20:00 <sil2100> #startmeeting Ubuntu Technical Board

 20:00 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:00:33 UTC.  The chair is sil2100.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:00 <sil2100> #topic Apologies

 20:00 <sil2100> I guess seb is out, right?

 20:01 <amurray> he doesn't appear to be online from what I can see

 20:01 <sil2100> I can't remember if he sent anything, but I think he's still out-of-office

 20:01 <sil2100> #topic Action review

 20:01 * sil2100 seb128/amurray/sil200 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage

 20:02 <sil2100> Not sure about seb or amurray, but I didn't work on this yet

 20:02 <rbasak-mobile> My actions all need carrying over please.

 20:02 <amurray> I recall seeing some update to the doc but I need to look at it again - carry over please

 20:02 <sil2100> Hopefully I can contribute more in the nearest month

 20:02 <sil2100> ACK

 20:03 <vorlon> (confirmed that Seb is OoO)

 20:03 <sil2100> #action seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage

 20:03 * meetingology seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage

 20:03 <vorlon> my action is also carry-over

 20:03 <sil2100> Now some actions from rbasak-mobile, carrying-over as requested

 20:03 <sil2100> #action rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification

 20:03 * meetingology rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification

 20:03 <sil2100> #action rbasak to follow up on finding consensus on question of test plans for third party apps

 20:03 * meetingology rbasak to follow up on finding consensus on question of test plans for third party apps

 20:04 <sil2100> #action rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy

 20:04 * meetingology rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy

 20:04 <sil2100> Next is:

 20:04 <sil2100> CTION: seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations

 20:04 <sil2100> I guess best would be if we had seb here

 20:05 <sil2100> I am certainly still responsible for the Release team documentation. As the release team knows, I have a short draft that I need to make public somewhere

 20:05 <sil2100> I'll discuss with the release team on the best placement for that

 20:05 <sil2100> Anything to add before I carry it over?

 20:05 <vorlon> no; I think it's clearly carry-over

 20:05 <sil2100> #action seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations

 20:05 * meetingology seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations

 20:06 <rbasak-mobile> I think the SRU side is done on the ML and just meeds transferring to formal docs

 20:06 <sil2100> Some carry overs:

 20:06 <sil2100> #action vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet

 20:06 * meetingology vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet

 20:06 <sil2100> #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request

 20:06 * meetingology seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request

 20:06 <sil2100> Now an action for me, but I think it's actually done:

 20:06 * sil2100 sil2100 to follow-up with ubuntu studio on 24.04 request

 20:07 <sil2100> In my latest reply to the LTS qualification, I signed off it with my TB hat

 20:07 <sil2100> So I consider this one done

 20:08 <sil2100> (no carry over)

 20:08 <tsimonq2> I have Lubuntu's draft LTS qualification on my desk and ready for a final ack today. Expect that soon.

 20:08 * sil2100 amurray to follow-up with edubuntu on 24.04 request

 20:08 <sil2100> amurray: how's your item looking? ^

 20:08 <sil2100> tsimonq2: excellent

 20:09 <amurray> I was waiting on them posting the support policy in some public location but I don't think they have anything (are apparently waiting on IS for their web hosting iirc)

 20:09 <Eickmeyer> amurray: Hi! As far as I was aware, that wasn't a hard requirement.

 20:09 <vorlon> sil2100: you're signing off as an individual TB member?  I think it's better governance-wise to have TB votes on these, as in the example of ubuntu-unity

 20:10 <sil2100> vorlon: oh, I was not aware that was the process

 20:10 <vorlon> well the wiki page says "TB" not "a member of the TB"

 20:10 <sil2100> vorlon: I thought in the past I saw it being single people signing off

 20:10 <sil2100> Then we can vote for that for sure

 20:11 <sil2100> #vote Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request

 20:11 <meetingology> Please vote on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request

 20:11 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 20:11 <sil2100> +1

 20:11 <meetingology> +1 received from sil2100

 20:11 <vorlon> +1

 20:11 <meetingology> +1 received from vorlon

 20:11 <amurray> +1

 20:11 <meetingology> +1 received from amurray

 20:12 <rbasak-mobile> +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here.

 20:12 <meetingology> +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here. received from rbasak-mobile

 20:12 <vorlon> addendum: we ought to make sure we have some central place collecting the state of LTS sign-off for all the flavors

 20:12 <sil2100> #endvote

 20:12 <meetingology> Voting ended on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request

 20:12 <meetingology> Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0

 20:12 <meetingology> Motion carried

 20:12 <sil2100> vorlon: +1 on that too!

 20:12 <sil2100> For now I'll follow up on the thread, let me add an action for that

 20:13 <sil2100> #action sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04

 20:13 * meetingology sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04

 20:13 <sil2100> Back to the previous action item

 20:13 <vorlon> do we want it in the 24.04 release notes in the discourse, or do we want it in a wiki page?

 20:14 <tsimonq2> addendum> There is an existing Discourse thread tracking information about 24.04 participation that also includes these details. I would suggest to the TB that they should manage a Discourse post with the official list.

 20:14 <sil2100> amurray: do you consider this a hard requirement for the policy to be made available right now, or would you be happy for this happening later?

 20:14 <tsimonq2> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/responses-needed-flavor-participation-for-24-04-lts/40075

 20:14 <amurray> no I don't consider it a hard policy but I think we would definitely want it before the release goes live

 20:14 <amurray> s/policy/requirement/

 20:15 <sil2100> amurray: +1 indeed

 20:15 <sil2100> amurray: if you're fine with the request otherwise, do you want to vote for it now?

 20:15 <vorlon> as long as the flavor commits to having it up by release time, regardless of domain hosting status

 20:16 <sil2100> Eickmeyer: ^ is that something you can commit to?

 20:16 <Eickmeyer> That puts Edubuntu in a rough situation with our current hosting situation. We simply do *not* have a place to put it.

 20:16 <rbasak-mobile> It seems weird to be waiting just because of an issue with publication in a particular place. I suggest just using Discourse in the meantime and so whether it is blocking or not shouldn't even need to be a question.

 20:16 <Eickmeyer> We're working with Aaron Prisk to get IS to work on this, but they don't have it as a priority item.

 20:17 <sil2100> So maybe like this: if by around release time the hosting situation is still not solved, would it be possible for you to publish a discourse post with all the details instead?

 20:17 <Eickmeyer> sil2100: It will be in the release notes for sure if the hosting situation isn't resolved. Our release notes have been published to Discourse in the meantime.

 20:17 <vorlon> NB hosting of per-flavor websites is not listed on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors as part of what Canonical commits to

 20:18 <sil2100> Eickmeyer: that sounds like a good plan B to me

 20:18 <sil2100> amurray WDYT?

 20:18 <amurray> works for me

 20:18 <sil2100> Let's vote

 20:18 <Eickmeyer> vorlon: Edubuntu used to be hosted by Canonical, and Ubuntu Studio currently is, along with Kubuntu, so there's precident.

 20:19 <sil2100> #vote Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request

 20:19 <meetingology> Please vote on: Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request

 20:19 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')

 20:19 <rbasak-mobile> No precedent for an SLA though. I didn't think hosting at all or not was in question?

 20:19 <sil2100> +1 (with the compromise as we discussed above)

 20:19 <meetingology> +1 (with the compromise as we discussed above) received from sil2100

 20:19 <amurray> +1

 20:19 <meetingology> +1 received from amurray

 20:20 <vorlon> the point is that from a governance perspective, the flavors are responsible for meeting the LTS requirements, and this isn't a buck that can be passed to Canonical IS

 20:21 <arraybolt3> There's already a workaround in place, there's no buck being passed that I can see.

 20:21 <sil2100> (vorlon, rbasak-mobile ^)

 20:22 <vorlon> +1

 20:22 <meetingology> +1 received from vorlon

 20:22 <rbasak-mobile> +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here.

 20:22 <meetingology> +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here. received from rbasak-mobile

 20:22 <sil2100> #endvote

 20:22 <meetingology> Voting ended on: Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request

 20:22 <meetingology> Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0

 20:22 <meetingology> Motion carried

 20:23 <sil2100> amurray: can you follow up with the final decision on the thread? Thank you!

 20:23 <amurray> yep

 20:23 <sil2100> #action amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04

 20:23 * meetingology amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04

 20:23 <sil2100> Carrying over seb's item

 20:23 <sil2100> #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request

 20:23 * meetingology seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request

 20:23 * sil2100 amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request

 20:24 <sil2100> amurray: ^ any luck with Kylin? I might have missed any ML threads regarding this

 20:24 <amurray> I proposed voting via email yesterday

 20:24 <tsimonq2> rbasak-mobile: There is existing precedence for flavors to ask Canonical to host infrastructure, however, to my knowledge it's been a courtesy rather than a requirement. For example, our domain is hosted by Canonical, and if that goes down, that would certainly reflect poorly on our qualification efforts.

 20:25 <vorlon> since the UbuntuKylin vote has already been called on the mailing list I propose we continue it there rather than voting in the meeting

 20:25 <sil2100> amurray: do you want to vote here instead?

 20:25 <amurray> I think email is fine

 20:26 <sil2100> ACK o/

 20:26 <sil2100> I'll carry it over then

 20:26 <rbasak-mobile> I agree but again this shouldn't be relevant or seen as blocking. We can be pragmatic and just publish somewhere else eg. Discourse. Not need for this to formally block anything.

 20:26 <sil2100> #action amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request

 20:26 * meetingology amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request

 20:26 <sil2100> Okay, let's move on

 20:26 <sil2100> #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed

 20:26 <vorlon> note that there is also CFV on the mailing list for Ubuntu Unity

 20:27 <vorlon> which wasn't assigned to me in the TB meeting when they were being assigned because I wasn't able to attend, instead I just picked up the ones that hadn't been assigned

 20:27 <sil2100> I'll try to follow up on those with votes then

 20:27 <sil2100> I think there are no actionable items on the ML that do not have actions already, from what I know?

 20:28 <sil2100> Since we have the participation e-mails, the process thread, and all those have action items assigned

 20:28 <rbasak-mobile> I think it's worth following up on a multitude of issues raised by the mutter regression but I'll follow up on the list first, hopefully this week.

 20:28 <sil2100> rbasak-mobile: thanks

 20:28 <sil2100> #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs'

 20:29 <sil2100> Nothing new there

 20:29 <sil2100> #topic Select a chair for the next meeting

 20:29 <sil2100> That would be amurray, with rbasak-mobile as backup

 20:29 <sil2100> If that'

 20:29 <vorlon> I'm very confused by that

 20:29 <sil2100> If that's fine

 20:30 <sil2100> Well, amurray is next after me, right?

 20:30 <vorlon> the wiki page said it was supposed to be seb128 with me as backup

 20:30 <vorlon> are we just jumping the pointer?

 20:30 <sil2100> I have volunteered today as I have not chaired for quite a long time

 20:30 <vorlon> I don't mind, it's just not historical practice :)

 20:31 <sil2100> #topic AOB

 20:31 <amurray> fwiw I think I am on leave during the next scheduled TB meeting so not sure if I will be able to make it at this time

 20:31 <sil2100> Ah, so maybe back to the scheduled chairs then? seb and vorlon as backup?

 20:32 <sil2100> If there are no objections, I'd propose that then

 20:32 <sil2100> Any other business?

 20:33 <vorlon> nothing else from me

 20:33 <amurray> nor from me

 20:34 <rbasak-mobile> Please don't wait on everyone to say no :-)

 20:35 <sil2100> ;)

 20:35 <sil2100> #endmeeting
