 15:07 <mclemenceau> o/

 15:08 <bdmurray> Hmm, I don't think I've seen this wiki page on mirrors

 15:10 <bdmurray> dbungert: shouldn't you have use â‰ˆ4 minutes ?

 15:11 <bdmurray> Or â‰… ?

 15:11 <dbungert> your unicode skills exceed my own

 15:13 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:13 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-oo-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <juliank> bug 2075183 is in universe but of high interest to Ubuntu QA I suppose

 15:15 <juliank> I'd like to argue Skia found it so Skia can fix it

 15:16 <bdmurray> ðŸ™„

 15:16 <juliank> Heh

 15:16 <waveform> oh dear, his unicode skills include emojis...

 15:16 <juliank> I think it might get lost

 15:16 <juliank> if unassigned

 15:16 <juliank> But oh well

 15:17 <juliank> Tagged

 15:17 <juliank> All other incoming lists are empty

 15:17 <bdmurray> It was reported upstream so maybe ...

 15:17 <juliank> Including the unknown ones not having anything for us

 15:17 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:17 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:18 <juliank> glibc blocking linux-meta remains with schopin

 15:19 <juliank> systemd blocking linux-meta: enr0n

 15:19 <juliank> (Yes I know this might be a linux bug but investigation)

 15:20 <juliank> initramfs-tools blocking  iproute2: vpa1977

 15:21 <juliank> systemd blocking iproute2: pushkarnk

 15:21 <juliank> No wait

 15:21 <juliank> I guess consult with enr0n

 15:22 <juliank> libxs-parse-keyword-perl remains with waveform

 15:22 <juliank> libheif remains with chriscoulson

 15:23 <juliank> glibc: schopin for the time being

 15:23 <juliank> man-db vs apparmor: vorlon

 15:24 <juliank> man-db vs linuxptp/4.2-1ubuntu1: uralt

 15:26 <juliank> sorry

 15:26 <juliank> man-dbg vs dgit/11.10: uralt

 15:26 <juliank> man-db vs firejail: dbungert

 15:26 <dbungert> ack

 15:26 <juliank> man-db vs lintian: liushuyu

 15:28 <juliank> man-db vs streamlink: mateus-morais

 15:28 <mateus-morais> ack

 15:29 <juliank> germinate: juliank

 15:30 <juliank> apt blocking valgrind: juliank

 15:30 <juliank> this passes but needs a retry for race condition

 15:30 <juliank> oh that's with ginggs

 15:32 <juliank> boost1.83 blocking python3-defaults: rkratky

 15:33 <juliank> python3-defaults vs sphinx/7.4.7-2: danilogondolfo

 15:33 <danilogondolfo> ack

 15:33 <juliank> python3-defaults vs wesnoth-1.18/1:1.18.2-1: ravikant_

 15:33 <ravikant_> juliank: ack

 15:34 <juliank> boost1.83 blocking {bzip2,icu} seem the same boost failure

 15:34 <rkratky> juliank: ack

 15:35 <juliank> rkratky: So I think all the boost1.83 tests just need retrying, so you can just collect all the triggers as retry-autopkgtest-regressions tends to do, and retry them all

 15:36 <juliank> there is a newer boost that migrated

 15:38 <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth  upils (potentially same as ravikant_'s issue)

 15:38 <juliank> icu vs  mysql-8.0/8.0.39-1  paride

 15:39 <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth: bdmurray

 15:39 <juliank> sorry

 15:39 <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth: bdrung

 15:39 <dbungert> juliank: if you want to give me one more, ginggs already ran the man-db vs firejail retest and it passed

 15:39 <rkratky> juliank: thanks

 15:40 <juliank> dbungert: Pick yourself from the grey list :)

 15:40 <juliank> #topic AOB

 15:40 <bdmurray> It finished during the meeting? \o/

 15:41 <dbungert> it did finish during the meeting

 15:41 <waveform> I'll be out next week

 15:42 <juliank> #endmeeting
