 20:03 <lucyllewy> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1st February 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:03 <lucyllewy> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:03 <lucyllewy> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <lucyllewy> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <lucyllewy> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:03 <lucyllewy> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:03 <lucyllewy> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:03 <lucyllewy> We only have one applicant today, Jason Nucciaarone

 20:04 <nuccitheboss> Hello everyone o/

 20:06 <nuccitheboss> Okay - time for intro

 20:10 <nuccitheboss> My name is Jason C. Nucciarone and I am an HPC engineer at Canonical, and a "Not so Ancient Elder" of the Ubuntu HPC community. Outside my primary duties at Canonical, I like to work with all things community. I started the HPC community team with several folks in the Ubuntu community to work on "Charmed HPC," which is a supercomputing stack that we are developing for Ubuntu. I am dedicated to this project because I want

 20:10 <nuccitheboss> to see Ubuntu more represented in the HPC ecosystem and be a viable alternative to the RHELatives. I do all sorts of things HPC, such as working with Simon, Aaron, and Mauro to organise Ubuntu-related conference, and I submit to lots of conference to speak about using Ubuntu for supercomputing

 20:11 <Kilos> ty

 20:12 <lucyllewy> ok. I'll let the board peruse those links and post and questions with the first question, which is mandatory:

 20:12 <lucyllewy> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 20:12 <nuccitheboss> Yes!

 20:21 <lucyllewy> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them! (2/2)
