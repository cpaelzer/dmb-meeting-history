 14:33 <cpaelzer> uh

 14:33 <cpaelzer> a lot today

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I feel we have talked udisk2 -> exfatprogs last time

 14:34 <sarnold> "But fakeroot FTBFS on armhf/oracular" .. how..?

 14:34 <sarnold> exfatprogs feels new to me

 14:34 <sarnold> I don't see it in /lastlog

 14:34 <cpaelzer> me neither

 14:35 <cpaelzer> maybe it was years ago

 14:35 <sarnold> ah that can happen :)

 14:35 <didrocks> yeah, sounds new to me too

 14:35 <cpaelzer> udisk2 is desktop - jbicha or didrocks - can you have a look what you want to do with thta

 14:35 <cpaelzer> now to the long list in -proposed

 14:35 <didrocks> I’ll defer to jbicha and track it if it’s not handled

 14:35 <slyon> no fakeroot is new

 14:35 <cpaelzer> rust pulls in docs and that pullsin  fonts and JS

 14:35 <slyon> I marked it as false-positive

 14:36 <cpaelzer> we asked for an auto-exclude last time, that already existed

 14:36 <cpaelzer> so it is about demoting the -doc

 14:36 <cpaelzer> which didn't happen

 14:36 <cpaelzer> is that otherwise ready to move? checking excuses ...

 14:36 <slyon> cpaelzer: I did the extra-exclude for rust-docs... but the -doc package needs demotion, so far no AA did it for me, could you?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I will slyon

 14:36 <slyon> thx

 14:36 <cpaelzer> also  main cannot depend on libstd-rust-1.76-dev in universe

 14:37 <cpaelzer> which also needs movement

 14:37 <cpaelzer> but is covered by the former MIRs

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ...

 14:37 <cpaelzer> more of the same

 14:37 <sarnold> i'm surprised that doesn't show up in this report

 14:37 <cpaelzer> there are also autopkgtest issues, so it won't move even if I fix where they live

 14:38 <cpaelzer> next is freeradius

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I'll carry this to the server team

 14:39 <cpaelzer> libusbmuxd -> libimobildedevuce-glue

 14:39 <cpaelzer> that is desktop

 14:39 <cpaelzer> jbicha: didrocks ^^ could you make someone have a look please to file a bug or resolve the reason it is pulled in?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> next is websockify by openstack

 14:39 <cpaelzer> jamespage: ^^ is that expected?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> python-redis sounds intense for something that just websockifies

 14:40 <didrocks> cpaelzer: ack

 14:40 <cpaelzer> python-jsonschema also is for openstack jamespage

 14:40 <cpaelzer> It seems one of you merged a bunch :-)

 14:41 <jamespage> yep aware

 14:41 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage thanks didrocks

 14:42 <cpaelzer> just a sec

 14:43 <cpaelzer> all others are known too

 14:43 <cpaelzer> next agenda item

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:43 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/highway/+bug/2070807

 14:43 <cpaelzer> it got its tests added a few hours before

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thereby ready for MIR review

 14:44 <cpaelzer> The package highway is required in Ubuntu main as a build and runtime dependency of jpeg-xl (LP: #2070882)

 14:44 <cpaelzer> the related jpeg-xl one is on joalif since two weeks

 14:45 <cpaelzer> looking for a volunteer to review

 14:45 <slyon> I can

 14:45 <cpaelzer> slyon: you or me - should I throw a coin?

 14:45 <slyon> throw the coin ;-)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> dice also said it is you 1-3 me 4-6 you - rolled a 6

 14:45 <didrocks999> if it doesn’t need to be this week, I can maybe handle it next one

 14:45 <cpaelzer> as managers I have all my old roleplaying dices here at the desk :-)

 14:45 <slyon> haha, that's fine

 14:46 <cpaelzer> we will soon enough have somethinf else for you didrocks999

 14:46 <cpaelzer> f->g

 14:46 <didrocks999> unsure if I’m relieved or scared :p

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thank you slyon

 14:46 <cpaelzer> remind me next time :-)

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:47 <sarnold> didrocks999: https://paste.debian.net/1323440/

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> one recent update

 14:47 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libdisplay-info/+bug/2071396

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:48 <didrocks999> sarnold: thanks! I won’t have to wait for an hour to have irclogs updated :)

 14:48 <slyon> I'd still like to see an update to the most recent version

 14:48 <cpaelzer> the update only is referring to dependencies

 14:48 <sarnold> :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> it is still incomplete

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I assume jbicha will come back to use once it is ready

 14:48 <cpaelzer> on him and incomplete - no action to be taken here

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:48 <cpaelzer> nothing new

 14:49 <cpaelzer> this section is muhc quicker since we did our cleanup

 14:49 <cpaelzer> thanks!

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:49 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:49 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:49 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:49 <cpaelzer> sarnold: you said progress is slow and time is scarce - any improvement?

 14:50 <sarnold> cpaelzer: a little, I had another conversation with management yesterday, who have promised some movement -- but nothing concrete yet, I think (I haven't checked scrollback yet this morning)

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I see the backlog growing relative to the things in progress

 14:50 <cpaelzer> we know two more currently in MIR review that likely will be added

 14:51 <cpaelzer> there is not much more to be said

 14:51 <cpaelzer> hoping for you to get people or time and if possible both sarnold

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:51 <slyon> nothing for me

 14:51 <sarnold> none here

 14:51 <cpaelzer> you all please raise awareness in your respective teams of the coming feature freeze in less than a month

 14:51 <sarnold> *gasp*

 14:51 <cpaelzer> yes, time flies that fast

 14:52 <cpaelzer> nothing else from me today

 14:52 <cpaelzer> didrocks: jamespage: anything you need to raise?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> or joalif if you read this today?

 14:52 <didrocks> nothing either. I’ll have some forwarding to do :)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:52 <cpaelzer> I'll put my reminder for the AA movements

 14:52 <cpaelzer> that is all for today then

 14:52 <sarnold> I misread "do any of you need a raise?" :)

 14:52 <didrocks> heh

 14:53 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I can't help with that

 14:53 <cpaelzer> ok then
