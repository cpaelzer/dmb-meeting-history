 16:02 <juliank> busy day!

 16:04 <bdmurray> juliank: Is your status still live?

 16:04 <juliank> no sorry

 16:05 <juliank> Forgot to update the timestamp

 16:05 <juliank> So yes, the DEP17 migration to /usr is at full steam

 16:05 <juliank> and should hopefully be also done tomorrow

 16:05 <juliank> The one for essential anyhow

 16:06 * juliank had one primary goal: Make mmdebstrap work on noble

 16:08 <bdmurray> dviererbe: regarding unzip autopkgtests for i386 I've seen the same thing with gzip

 16:08 <bdmurray> dviererbe: I think there is a bug for that

 16:09 <dviererbe> bdmurray: is there anything I can do?

 16:09 <bdmurray> write a patch? ;-)

 16:09 <dviererbe> :D

 16:13 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:13 <bdmurray> wait

 16:13 <bdmurray> I finally found it!

 16:13 <bdmurray> dviererbe: bug 1881504

 16:13 <dviererbe> thx

 16:13 <juliank> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:13 <juliank> bug 2049904

 16:17 <bdmurray> juliank: yes, and?

 16:17 <mkukri> removing rustc, it's not really a bug, rustc does weird things but i think it's "by diesng"

 16:17 <mkukri> *design

 16:19 <juliank> Sorry doing DEP17 /usr move coordination in parallel

 16:19 <bdmurray> Focus man

 16:19 <juliank> Lots of talking to helmut :)

 16:20 <juliank> so this is fixed already and the report is out to date

 16:20 <bdmurray> Thursday, 22. February 2024 14:31 UTC hardly?

 16:20 <juliank> ugh no rustc is open, but meson is done

 16:21 <mkukri> removed rustc

 16:21 <juliank> thanks

 16:21 <juliank> bug 2054319

 16:21 <bdmurray> I think the problem here is polkit

 16:21 <juliank> We already have one for tracker anyway, so let's remove that

 16:22 <juliank> tracker-extract crashing is in u-r-u backlog

 16:22 <juliank> the polkit crash could eventually crash gnome-shell

 16:23 <juliank> I don't really want to tag this with 3 packages as we get three JIRA issues which will be awkward

 16:23 <juliank> I guess desktop is doing some analysis too

 16:24 <juliank> I suggest we skip it until next week

 16:24 <juliank> maybe the culprit has been seen by then :)

 16:24 <juliank> bug 2054341

 16:25 <juliank> fwiw I expect we'll see a bunch more diversions fail next week due to stuff from /bin /sbin moving to /usr

 16:25 <juliank> I'd argue the idea to make the diversion script a no-op if real script is not present is the right choice, and lets take it

 16:26 <juliank> Nothing going on in other releases

 16:27 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:27 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs
