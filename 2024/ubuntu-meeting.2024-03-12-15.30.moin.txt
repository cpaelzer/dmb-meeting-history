 15:30 <joalif> o/

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:32 <slyon> for c-m: We got trace-cmd seeded while the MIR is not yet fully ready. But It's beeing worked on. I linked the most recent MIRs for libtraceevent and libtracefs this morning

 15:32 <slyon> libtraceevent is making some progress (patch adding tests needs review & sponsoring), libtracefs is stuck currently reaching out for help from the Foundations system squad

 15:33 <slyon> c-m-proposed: we have a bunch of new stuff in here..

 15:33 <slyon> gst-plugins-good1.0 and roc-toolkit are desktop-packages. So I'd like to ask didrocks to investigate those (later on)

 15:34 <slyon> jaraco.text and python-openstacksdk are ubuntu-openstack packages, for jamespage to look into.

 15:34 <slyon> Everything else seems known/explained

 15:34 <jamespage> will look

 15:34 <slyon> thx!

 15:34 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 15:34 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:34 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:35 <slyon> bug #2056099

 15:35 <slyon> was this discussed last week? (I wasn't here)

 15:36 <slyon> looks like foundations agreed to own the package. So it could go through MIR review.

 15:36 <sarnold> I think last week we decided to see if foundations would accept it

 15:36 <ahresse_> Hello, this has been discussed last year and a owner was missing but foundation is actually willing to take it.

 15:36 <sarnold> and the last comment suggests that they have :)

 15:36 <ahresse_> last week*

 15:36 <slyon> do we have any volunteers? (I'd like to abstain, as this will be foundations owned)

 15:36 <slyon> joalif or cpaelzer maybe?

 15:37 <joalif> slyon: I can take it

 15:37 <slyon> thank you!

 15:37 <slyon> assigned.

 15:37 <slyon> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:37 <slyon> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:37 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:39 <slyon> there are two *trace* updates (bug #2051916 & bug #2051925) that I explained earlier. Nothing actionable for the MIR team, yet.

 15:39 <slyon> Finally, bug #2054480

 15:39 * slyon reading...

 15:40 <slyon> MIR reviewer asked for additional/improved testing. Upstream developers are involved. So this is correctly set to "Incomplete" and back to the reporter for now until resolved.

 15:40 <slyon> Nothing to do for us

 15:41 <slyon> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:41 <slyon> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:41 <slyon> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:41 <slyon> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:42 <slyon> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/52 which is related to the `tree` MIR above

 15:42 <slyon> being addressed via https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/53

 15:43 <slyon> let's put our +1 or suggestions for improvement on GitHub, so paelzer can mere once ready

 15:43 <slyon> merge*

 15:44 <slyon> Then we have eslerm's https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/51

 15:45 <slyon> consensus seems to be adding per-package hacks in debian/rules to delete unnecessary vendored crates. Which was my understanding, too.

 15:46 <slyon> This is not nice, but probably better than shipping (and reviewing) lots of unused code.

 15:46 <slyon> I brought the cause up with the Foundations toolchaing squad. They are currently busy, so we should not expect a centralized solution soon. I'll try to push it for next cycle's roadmap, though.

 15:47 <slyon> so I guess that it's mostly for didrocks to look into fixing/cleaning up his package manually

 15:47 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:47 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:47 <slyon> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 15:47 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:47 <slyon> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:47 <slyon> sarnold: what's the security-team's status?

 15:49 <slyon> bug #2055434 looks like it needs a `sec-*` tag

 15:49 <sarnold> slyon: I belivee that we're still doing alright, but some departures from the team may impact our velocity if we have late additions in the cycle

 15:50 <slyon> The number of new MIRs has been relatively low (or rather balanced before feature freeze) this cycle. Let's hope it stays this way and we don't get a lot of late additions.

 15:50 <sarnold> there we go, https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-3971

 15:50 <slyon> sweet thanks!

 15:51 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 15:51 <sarnold> yeah, it's felt very calm .. a little too calm .. *harmonica music*

 15:51 <joalif> sarnold: wrt https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-3971 it may not need a sec review after all

 15:51 <sarnold> none here (well, I've got a very small nagging feeling that I've forgotten something. sigh. but if I can't remember it now...)

 15:53 <slyon> joalif: that's because it's not a root daemon?

 15:53 <sarnold> joalif: it sounded a bit like it's got a root daemon and a client of some sort, but I couldn't quickly tell if non-root was supposed to be able to use it, etc ..

 15:53 <sarnold> if non-root processes are communicating with a root daemon as part of the task, then it's probably worth a quick look

 15:54 <joalif> well it's not a deamon, and th i spent quite some time if this needs a sec review and decided to play on safe side and put it for sec review

 15:55 <joalif> ok lemme discuss it with waveform  on the bug and if need be i'll remove it from sec review

 15:55 <slyon> thanks joalif!

 15:55 <sarnold> nice, thanks :)

 15:56 <slyon> If nothing else, that's all for today.

 15:56 <joalif> nothing else from me

 15:56 <slyon> thanks all!

 15:56 <slyon> #endmeeting
