 15:03 <schopin> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-2024-03-28/43534/1

 15:03 <dviererbe> o/

 15:04 <slyon> upils: is the patch for MIR libtraceevent ready, yet?

 15:04 <upils> nope, I still need to re-add a patch I removed, as spotted by enr0n

 15:05 <slyon> ok

 15:11 <schopin> vorlon: when you say "the migration has landed", is the publisher done yet?

 15:11 <vorlon> schopin: not afaik

 15:11 <vorlon> but it's landed from the perspective of buttons that can be pushed from the Release Team side

 15:12 <bdmurray> vorlon: Should we drop the `all-proposed` changes to britney and autopkgtest-cloud now?

 15:12 <bdmurray> I mean the forcing of all-proposed.

 15:13 <vorlon> bdmurray: yes, due to pytest being broken in -proposed. I left that to juliank to sort out with the QA Team overnight, but I guess he didn't :)

 15:13 <adrien> well, he's officially off

 15:14 <juliank> vorlon: We have prepped the merges for it, but I left final decision to sil2100

 15:15 <bdmurray> off?

 15:15 <schopin> Alright, moving on :)

 15:15 <schopin> unless juliank wants to take over ? ;)

 15:15 <juliank> Nah I'm cleaning my kitchen

 15:15 <schopin> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:15 <schopin> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:16 <schopin> bug 2054343

 15:17 <schopin> it's already foundations-todo, so untagging from incoming.

 15:17 <vorlon> also not clear it applies to noble at all?

 15:18 <blackboxsw> I also have a question about whether we shoud treat https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/needrestart/+bug/2059337 as rls-incoming? hence my dropping into the call today.

 15:18 <vorlon> blackboxsw: you should tag rls-nn-incoming anything that you want to escalate to the corresponding engineering team for consideration

 15:19 <vorlon> anyway I'll say we should take that one

 15:19 <blackboxsw> +1 thanks , wanted a pre-flight check before I do. will do I'm uncertain about whether this is a default behavior that'll affect a any package/script which invokes apt upgradedist-upgrade and happens the be targetted for needrestart operation. :)

 15:19 <vorlon> tagging it foundations-todo now

 15:19 <blackboxsw> thank you

 15:20 <vorlon> blackboxsw: "any package/script" - it looks at systemd units

 15:21 <blackboxsw> ahh, limits my concern a bit then. but still a potentially broad net of services which we may or may not know about.

 15:22 <schopin> bug 1951491

 15:24 <vorlon> this is weird, the bug is from 2021

 15:24 <schopin> fairly regular activity on it, though.

 15:25 <vorlon> yeah but if it's been open for 3 years already I don't think we should prioritize it

 15:25 <vorlon> also the systemd task is incomplete and the snapd task is open

 15:25 <vorlon> I think we should leave this as-is and maybe ping snapd team about it

 15:25 <schopin> Alright, moving on.

 15:25 <schopin> bug 2058930

 15:25 <slyon> This got resolved the other day

 15:26 <slyon> I just removed the tag

 15:26 <schopin> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:26 <schopin> bug 2041518

 15:27 <schopin> that's an old one, it's with desktop.

 15:27 <schopin> bug 2041831

 15:29 <schopin> I agree with juliank on that one, it's likely a pygobject issue, leaving the tag for Desktop to triage.

 15:29 <schopin> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:29 <schopin> Nothing for us there.

 15:30 <schopin> Plus EOL already. Someone should update the script :)

 15:30 <schopin> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:30 <schopin> bug 2058743

 15:31 <slyon> This one is most probably related to dnsmasq and should be investigated by ~ubuntu-server

 15:31 <schopin> So nothing for us to do there?

 15:31 <slyon> not currently

 15:32 <schopin> Alright then :)

 15:32 <schopin> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:32 <schopin> Nothing for us.

 15:33 <schopin> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:33 <schopin> vorlon: ^

 15:33 <vorlon> Traceback (most recent call last):

 15:33 <vorlon> File "/home/ubuntu-archive/bin/generate-team-p-m", line 382, in <module>

 15:33 <vorlon> main()

 15:33 <vorlon> File "/home/ubuntu-archive/bin/generate-team-p-m", line 312, in main

 15:33 <vorlon> if 'implicit-deps' in item['policy_info']['implicit-deps']:

 15:33 <vorlon> haha the by_team report broke when I turned off the terrible britney policy

 15:33 <vorlon> KeyError: 'implicit-deps'

 15:33 <vorlon> so since the report isn't *yet* updated there's nothing to do on this topic

 15:34 <schopin> except maybe fix the script :P

 15:34 <schopin> #topic AOB

 15:36 <bdmurray> I gather there is a holiday weekend coming up

 15:37 <schopin> Yes, apparently most of the team is out Monday, and most of those also Friday.

 15:38 <bdmurray> Poor Steve, Dan, Chris and I

 15:38 <zhsj> i'm out on next thu and fri.

 15:38 <schopin> bdmurray: most of the French part of the team will at least be there on Friday :)

 15:39 <pushkarnk> I am out on a public holiday tomorrow

 15:39 <mateus-morais> I'm out tomorrow, but I'm here on monday

 15:39 <bdmurray> I also heard upgrading to Noble now is a bad idea?

 15:39 <dviererbe> I am out tomorrow & monday too

 15:39 <mclemenceau> I'll be here friday / monday

 15:39 <schopin> bdmurray: referring to https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2024-March/042954.html I guess?

 15:40 <slyon> you beat me to it :)

 15:41 <vorlon> schopin: the report is regenerated but not visible until rsync

 15:47 <vorlon> is the meeting over?

 15:47 <bdmurray> I think so

 15:48 <schopin> #endmeeting
