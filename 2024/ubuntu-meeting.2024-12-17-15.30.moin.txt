 15:31 <cpaelzer> and I'm slightly distracted with a sick rabbit on my lap

 15:31 <cpaelzer> but we will get this done

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <sarnold> aww poor bunny :(

 15:32 <cpaelzer> normal view is good

 15:32 <cpaelzer> proposed has a bit

 15:32 <cpaelzer> hmm, I didn't pick up sanlock as new

 15:32 <cpaelzer> but it is there

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I'll ask sergio

 15:32 <sarnold> hah, and I missed augeas entirely

 15:33 <sarnold> it's already got an approved MIR?

 15:33 <sarnold> is this *ancient* MIR bug really "the bug"? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/augeas/+bug/434836

 15:33 <cpaelzer> it was there in the long past

 15:34 <cpaelzer> anyway conside this to be done

 15:34 <sarnold> .. I have to wonder if charms would have been easier if this were part of main

 15:34 <sarnold> but apparently it was, and they weren't? :)

 15:34 <cpaelzer> yep

 15:34 <cpaelzer> abseil -> google test sounds like a memory

 15:35 <cpaelzer> seb128: jbicha: would one of you plesae look afte rabseil?

 15:35 <seb128> will do

 15:35 <cpaelzer> highway is a known case

 15:35 <cpaelzer> so is jemalloc

 15:35 <cpaelzer> all in reviewstages

 15:35 <cpaelzer> and then the set of openstack packages which grind their way to proper cases

 15:35 <cpaelzer> all good, actions distributed

 15:35 <cpaelzer> going on

 15:36 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:37 <cpaelzer> three caes with recent updates

 15:37 <slyon> o/

 15:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rust-sequoia-sqv/+bug/2089690 - non change, just more incomplete bug task states

 15:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgit2/+bug/2080872

 15:37 <cpaelzer> assigning to people

 15:37 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480

 15:38 <cpaelzer> discussions between Pragyansh and sarnold

 15:38 <sarnold> libgit2 is more than that

 15:38 <sarnold> near the very top there's a new merge proposal

 15:38 <cpaelzer> readiny ...

 15:38 <cpaelzer> I ee, asssigned to sponsors

 15:38 <sarnold> I wish the 'flow' of comments could indicate that, I also jumped right past it yesterday when talking it over with eslerm :)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> nice

 15:39 <sarnold> is there anything we need to do to encourage this one along?

 15:39 <cpaelzer> this is what we wanted and discussed as least worse option

 15:39 <cpaelzer> no it will be picked up by patch pilots of foundations sponsors I'd assume

 15:40 <sarnold> cool cool

 15:40 <slyon> well... it's still "on hold", why's that?

 15:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: your comment on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480 - do you consider it a hint or a blocking (all arch need to be enabled)

 15:40 <slyon> latest comment was "Currently pending review from the security team"

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I need to read more what the recent comments are about

 15:40 <cpaelzer> seems the apparmor profile

 15:41 <cpaelzer> indeed slyon

 15:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold:  is that review what you've been going over with eslerm?

 15:41 <cpaelzer> should we add a ubuntu-security review slot maybe?

 15:41 <slyon> well, sarnold already did the quick approval here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgit2/+bug/2080872/comments/5

 15:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: libgit2, eslerm raised it with me, I think he's mostly interested in making sure that goes all the way to completion

 15:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: nbd, I don't think anybody has raised that one

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I like that they work on tests and appamor - I wonder at what point we should call the propose sufficient

 15:44 <cpaelzer> I want to avoid some others rushing through without by saying they tried and can't - and those that spend the effort to be punished by small thing in it

 15:44 <sarnold> ugh I think they went off into the weeds on this one

 15:44 <cpaelzer> to be clear - all I am is unsure

 15:45 <cpaelzer> but I'm tending to want to reward that go for tests and isolation with a positive posture

 15:45 <cpaelzer> so when they come back for review or sponsoring I'd feel +1'ish (plus actually looking at it in depth)

 15:45 <cpaelzer> sarnold:  this feels they tried to explain to you in the last comment

 15:46 <cpaelzer> I'm unsure if more pings there help much, maybe send a DM and discuss this whenever you are both online?

 15:46 <cpaelzer> and then add a comment on the bug with whatever your closing state is afte rthat discussion?

 15:46 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I'll write up a comment

 15:47 <cpaelzer> slyon: do you know if Pragyansh is in EOY already?

 15:47 <sarnold> "both online" is going to be a Big Challenge, I have a few hours left in the year :)

 15:47 <cpaelzer> not sure if you still see the foundations calendar

 15:47 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ok I see why you therefore consider a bug comment

 15:47 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:47 <cpaelzer> let us go on

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:47 <slyon> cpaelzer: sarnold:, no r41k0u still seems to be around

 15:48 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/72 is still draft - not touching this one

 15:48 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/75 would be ready if you like it slyon and sarnold?

 15:49 <cpaelzer> it is what we discussed, allowing for doing a bit more than "auto-yes" when we see renames - AND - the case is super duper old

 15:49 <cpaelzer> and allowing this to be non gating

 15:49 <sarnold> reading

 15:49 <cpaelzer> and furthermore allowing teams to suggest for re-review - which is a nice offering but has to be balanced

 15:49 <cpaelzer> e.g. we recently had a full rewrite in rust - that is worth re-checking and I've done so

 15:50 <cpaelzer> there is no rush, if you both are happy in 3 min - fine. Otherwise leave your comments and I can evolve it until the meeting next year

 15:51 <slyon> +1, lgtm

 15:51 <sarnold> > We'd appreciate if the owning team could file a MIR-reporter bug for it, but would not insist on it if they can't. In that case we create a stub for it.

 15:52 <sarnold> if the goal is to get packages onto our queue, asking for the bug doesn't seem to be too much to ask, right/

 15:52 <sarnold> as a percentage of effort ..

 15:52 <cpaelzer> if they self-ask then it would be no challenge

 15:52 <cpaelzer> but if all that happened is auto sync libfoo3 over libfoo2

 15:52 <cpaelzer> then I thought we can ask, but not insist

 15:53 <sarnold> ahhh, to avoid a potential case of a team needing to do a dozen of them in one cycle?

 15:53 <cpaelzer> yes

 15:53 <slyon> right. Filing a MIR bug takes quite some investigation, and people might not like that. We could still file a stub and do the review/recommendations in there

 15:53 <sarnold> okay, sounds good. baby steps.

 15:53 <cpaelzer> hence all of this is optional - a first step to a better world but acknowledging the shrotages

 15:53 <cpaelzer> also Schrott :-) but actuall shortages

 15:53 <slyon> :)

 15:54 <cpaelzer> BTW I also have more ruls to put down out of archive admin work on multivers/restricted - but one at a time

 15:54 <sarnold> :D (I had to look that one up)

 15:54 <cpaelzer> ok 2x good

 15:54 <cpaelzer> merging

 15:54 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:54 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:54 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 15:54 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:54 <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl was on my mind

 15:54 <cpaelzer> it is still in TODO but now has a name

 15:54 <cpaelzer> is that good sarnold?

 15:55 <sarnold> yes, it is good, but likely very little has been done recently :)

 15:55 <jbicha> I just uploaded a jpeg-xl security fix to plucky today 😐

 15:55 <cpaelzer> hope for increased progress in january?

 15:56 <sarnold> also, our poor coverity server seems unhappy after repatriating :( we're looking into charming it up to deploy into one of the prodstacks now that we have decent vm capacity

 15:56 <sarnold> I also hope so, I'll certainly be a bit pointier in asking for status updates post-holidays :) -- december is not a month for getting things done :/

 15:56 <cpaelzer> ok, so TL;DR many reasons, the queue is not moving much but gladly not (yet) huge either

 15:57 <cpaelzer> it is THE month to get things done, get into the close-out-before-EOY feeling

 15:57 <sarnold> rodrigo did sound optimistic to push exfatprogs over the finish line soon :)

 15:57 <cpaelzer> great

 15:57 <sarnold> we shouldn't schedule our use-it-or-lose-it-PTO rally in the same month

 15:57 <cpaelzer> I think that is it then for today

 15:57 <cpaelzer> yes @sarnold

 15:57 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:57 <slyon> nothing.

 15:57 <jbicha> btw, Desktop intends to file a MIR soon for https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glycin as a dependency for the loupe image viewer. Probably more of a 25.10 project but we are trying to give Security more time.

 15:57 <cpaelzer> enjoy the downtime for some fresh energey next year

 15:57 <sarnold> see you next year :)

 15:58 <jbicha> it's a bit of a next gen gdk-pixbuf

 15:58 <cpaelzer> yeah jbicha, doing that early will help

 15:58 <slyon> jbicha: thanks for the heads up!

 15:58 <sarnold> jbicha: hopefully without a scary warning to the console every single upgrade? :)

 15:58 <cpaelzer> but I assume it will need to exist alongside gdk-pixbuf for a whiel

 15:58 <slyon> if you could file a stub MIR already, that might help to keep it on our radar

 15:58 <sarnold> > The decoding happens in sandboxed modular image loaders

 15:58 <cpaelzer> indeed

 15:58 <sarnold> WOOOHOOO

 15:59 <jbicha> yes, this was filed recently but it's very early: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/issues/53

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I want to keep the feeling of hope and call it done for today

 15:59 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 15:59 <cpaelzer> nice to show advantages AND drawbacks

 15:59 <cpaelzer> that background in a stub would indeed already help

 15:59 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
