 15:05 <bdmurray> Skia: What was the kernel bug regarding autopkgtest that might have been related to bug 2063094?

 15:08 <bdmurray> adrien: There was a thought that bug 2056461 might be related to your unattended-upgrades bug.

 15:09 <Skia> there, you found it, sorry for the delay, I was busy posting my status late :/

 15:10 <Skia> (I also lost some time diving into adrien's new excuse page, it looks great!)

 15:10 <adrien> oh, that's a bit surprising

 15:10 <adrien> host kernel is 6.1.0-15-amd64

 15:11 <adrien> Skia: :)

 15:11 <bdmurray> I was seeing it on noble as was apw

 15:11 <adrien> it's not the first time I see that issue but I can't tell when was the first time

 15:11 <adrien> bdmurray: considering that seb had a very different backtrace, I wouldn't be surprised there are several bugs

 15:12 <bdmurray> Hrm, I'm not seeing bug 2056461 in the changelog for our linux package though...

 15:14 <adrien> also, I'll be running dbus-monitor for a while; we'll see if something changes from there

 15:14 <bdmurray> Skia: Could you check with the kernel team about the fix?

 15:15 <Skia> sure

 15:16 <bdrung> done with reading and ready to move on?

 15:17 <bdmurray> I've finished reading

 15:17 <bdrung> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:17 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:18 <bdrung> bug #2066995

 15:18 <schopin> No oo incoming?

 15:18 <bdrung> (doing nn before oo)

 15:19 <bdrung> that bug needs triaging.

 15:20 <bdrung> schopin, could you have a look at it?

 15:21 <schopin> hem, that's a weird one?

 15:22 <bdrung> yes

 15:23 <bdrung> should we keep it in incoming until next week to have it triaged by then?

 15:23 <schopin> OK with me. I'll spend some time looking over the logs in details.

 15:24 <bdrung> ok. next: bug #2067120

 15:25 <bdrung> @bdmurray, i suggested a fix for what i could see. Can you test if that fixes it for you as well?

 15:25 <bdrung> IMO we can tag this one as foundations-todo

 15:25 <bdmurray> bdrung: I will test it today

 15:26 <bdrung> okay. tagged.

 15:27 <bdrung> bug #2063094

 15:31 <bdrung> this is the bug @Skia talked about previously

 15:32 <bdrung> should we tag it? it looks important enough to me and @adrien provided logs (i did not look into unattended-upgrades-bt.tar.xz)

 15:33 <ogayot> I also think we should tag it

 15:34 <bdrung> tagged

 15:34 <Skia> I think it's bdmurray that mentionned it, I don't have any context on this one, but I only know that it might be linked to LP#2056461 that I investigated from a very different angle

 15:34 <schopin> do we have enough to debug it?

 15:34 <bdmurray> Based of what adrien said I'm somewhat concerned issues are being conflated here

 15:35 <adrien> I'm a bit surprised with the stacks I've been seeing: I would have assumed they don't take CPU time

 15:36 <adrien> maybe the same operation fails repeatedly and is re-tried however

 15:36 <adrien> but I was also planning to wait for Julian to look at the traces before thinking more about the issue

 15:36 <bdrung> adrien, will you carry that bug forward?

 15:37 <bdrung> next: bug #2067071

 15:37 <bdrung> oh, i see "TypeError: apport_excepthook() missing 1 required positional argument: 'exc_tb'" in there

 15:38 <bdrung> the python stack trace looks simple enough to debug that. any objections to tagging it?

 15:38 <adrien> bdrung: no, I don't have time for that, especially since I'm not familiar with that and also since python-auth2client will be quite some work

 15:39 <bdmurray> Let's hold leave the uanttended-upgrades bug for next week then

 15:39 <bdmurray> enr0n: Are there any duplicates of bug 2067071?

 15:39 <enr0n> Yeah we should definitely take this. I wanted Julian's input on why the _cand would be None

 15:39 <enr0n> bdmurray: maybe, but I have not had time yet to go through all the recent bug reports

 15:40 <bdrung> tagged

 15:40 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-oo-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:40 <bdrung> bug #2063204

 15:42 <bdrung> looks like there is a foundation discussion how to address it. objections to tagging it?

 15:45 <bdrung> tagged then.

 15:45 <bdrung> bug #1969394

 15:46 <bdmurray> that might be more desktop

 15:46 <bdrung> Seems more like an UI task that we can leave to the desktop team

 15:46 <bdrung> bug #2063467

 15:48 <bdrung> leaving it for next week for juliank to be back

 15:48 <bdrung> bug #2067350

 15:49 <bdrung> looks valid to me. schopin should we tag it?

 15:50 <schopin> as far as glibc is concerned I'm OK with this, but I'd like doko's ACK on it for the gcc part?

 15:50 <bdrung> schopin, can you get dokos response in the ticket? then let's keep it till next week.

 15:51 <bdrung> bug #2015538

 15:51 <bdrung> leave that to the desktop team

 15:51 <bdrung> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:55 <adrien> I started on the python-oauth2client and I think removal is doable but it will take some time as revdeps are not updated in packages :/
