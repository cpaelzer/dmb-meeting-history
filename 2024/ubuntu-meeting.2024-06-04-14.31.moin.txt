 14:32 <joalif> o/

 14:32 <cpaelzer> abseil -> googletest on desktop

 14:32 <eslerm> o/

 14:32 <cpaelzer> IIRC they said they will have a look

 14:32 <cpaelzer> but there was jbicha saying hi

 14:32 <cpaelzer> maybe he knows a current state

 14:33 <slyon> o/

 14:33 <cpaelzer> the other are python-inflect and pytohn-arrow pointing to pytohn-typeguard and typeshed

 14:33 <cpaelzer> that was openstack and jamespage

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I didn't see a reply

 14:33 <jbicha> I haven't looked into abseil -> googletest yet

 14:33 <cpaelzer> no problem jbicha, as long as it is in your todo-queue we are ok

 14:33 <cpaelzer> the cycle is early still :-)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I'll send a mail to jamespage in case he missed the IRC pings

 14:34 <sarnold> good morning

 14:36 <cpaelzer> mail sent

 14:36 <cpaelzer> going on

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:36 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I've got mine reivewed of last week

 14:36 <cpaelzer> many others wnated to do their assignment this week IIRC

 14:36 <cpaelzer> let us look what is new

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysprof/+bug/2066269

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ah, that is why jbicha is here :-)

 14:37 <jamespage> o/

 14:37 <sarnold> jbicha is always here :)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> true

 14:37 <cpaelzer> but even more

 14:37 <jbicha> I plan to finish filling out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/Sysprof and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/GnomeBuilder today

 14:38 <cpaelzer> awesome

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I can have a look at a review tomorrow

 14:38 <cpaelzer> If the test process is complete by then that would be great

 14:38 <cpaelzer> assigned myself

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:40 <jbicha> cpaelzer: oops, I forgot to subscribe ubuntu-mir to #2066262 and #2066272 (done now): those are deps of sysprof

 14:40 <cpaelzer> uh

 14:40 <cpaelzer> thanks jbicha

 14:40 <cpaelzer> more reviews to share then

 14:40 <jbicha> bug 2066272 bug 2066262

 14:40 <cpaelzer> liiking for volunteers now

 14:40 <cpaelzer> "looking"

 14:40 <joalif> i can have one

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I also like review volunteers though

 14:41 <cpaelzer> libdex or libpanel - any preference joalif?

 14:41 <slyon> I'm off next week, but could take one for the week after.

 14:41 <cpaelzer> btw jamespage - I saw your "o/" - sorry for sending you a mail - have you seen the two mismatches above?

 14:41 <cpaelzer> ok slyon, I think that is better than no reviewer :-)

 14:41 <joalif> libdex please

 14:42 <cpaelzer> done

 14:42 <joalif> thanks

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: maybe you can come to the "needs security review" yes/no this week - to enqueue it there before you are out?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> only if it is a trivial call to make, and anything in depth is fine for when you are back

 14:43 <slyon> my "distro day" for this week is almost over, not sure if I can make that

 14:43 <sarnold> good idea :)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> WDYT slyon - is that possible - or is that breaking your planned tasks before you leave?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: ok, give it a best effort try if you can

 14:43 <slyon> ok

 14:44 <cpaelzer> not wasting time discussing it further, you see sarnold would appreciate it :-)

 14:44 <cpaelzer> no recent incomplete bug updates, going on

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:45 <cpaelzer> two recent contribs by eslerm

 14:45 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/57

 14:45 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/56

 14:46 <cpaelzer> both blocked on the older libseed spelling

 14:46 <jamespage> cpaelzer: seen

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I like both PRs, short, concise and to the point

 14:46 <cpaelzer> slyon:  has approved one already

 14:46 <slyon> just approved the 2nd one

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I'll give both a check tomorrow

 14:47 <eslerm> thank you slyon and cpaelzer

 14:47 <cpaelzer> and if I'm +1 as well merge them and fix the silly spelling check issue

 14:47 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:47 <cpaelzer> going on ...

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:47 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:47 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:47 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I think we had no recent additions

 14:48 <cpaelzer> any update on those in the queue for longer?

 14:48 <slyon> I reviewed bug #2067373 today. I think it can be queued for security already, while desktop works out the kinks

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ok, I'm sure sarnold can add that there right?

 14:48 <sarnold> yup!

 14:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: maybe an expectation on when s3transfer and boto3 will get started?

 14:50 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I expect one should start this week, unsure of how many more

 14:50 <cpaelzer> as long as they not continue to just wait we are ok atm I guess

 14:50 <cpaelzer> but you can expect some more to come to your queue

 14:50 <cpaelzer> like 3 of sysprof we've seen above are likely

 14:51 <cpaelzer> with that in mind, going on ...

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:51 <cpaelzer> nothing from the server team atm

 14:51 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:52 <slyon> nothing from me

 14:52 <cpaelzer> joalif: jamespage: jbicha: eslerm: anything from you?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> countdown in 10

 14:52 <joalif> nothing

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 12

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 8

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 47

 14:52 <cpaelzer> 51

 14:52 <cpaelzer> kind of now ...

 14:52 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks

 14:52 <cpaelzer> I think we are good for today

 14:52 <joalif> thanks cpaelzer all :)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> about everyone got something to work on

 14:52 <eslerm> nothing :)

 14:52 <slyon> thanks all!

 14:52 <cpaelzer> but no one got an insane amount

 14:52 <cpaelzer> that is how it should be

 14:52 <cpaelzer> thanks!

 14:53 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
