 14:34 <slyon> looks much cleaner! and all known. with bug #2072621 blocked on security review.

 14:34 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 14:35 <slyon> bug #2069308

 14:35 <slyon> this looks mostly ready, but MIR requirement #1 should be looked at (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xdg-terminal-exec/+bug/2069308/comments/4) CC jbicha nteodosio

 14:35 <sarnold> nice to have a comment from vladirmir

 14:36 <slyon> indeed!

 14:36 <slyon> bug #2070025

 14:36 <jbicha> the component-mismatches reported haven't updated in almost a week

 14:37 <sarnold> uhoh

 14:37 <slyon> uh oh.. so we might be up for some surprise

 14:38 <slyon> wsdd got security ACK, but cpaelzer had a bunch of MIR requirements, that I'm not clear if they got resolved. Maybe he can check and comment on that after the meeting

 14:38 <jbicha> I can handle 1 and 2 for xdg-terminal-exec. We won't be promoting it to main for oracular though

 14:39 <slyon> thanks!

 14:39 <nteodosio> jbicha, there is https://salsa.debian.org/freedesktop-team/xdg-terminal-exec/-/merge_requests/1.

 14:40 <slyon> bug #2080965

 14:40 <jbicha> oops I wasn't subscribed to merge request notifications at that time

 14:40 <slyon> I guess I can take architecture-properties

 14:41 <slyon> bug #2080062

 14:41 <slyon> joalif: Could you take that for MIR review? ^

 14:43 <slyon> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:44 <slyon> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/67

 14:44 <slyon> thanks for reporting this sarnold! I could not reproduce on my end, but pinged dviererbe about it. I don't think it's super urgent.

 14:45 <slyon> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/66

 14:46 <slyon> Thanks for all your input on this so far. I integrated most of it today.

 14:46 <slyon> sarnold: I left a comment for you here https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/66#discussion_r1763003517

 14:47 <sarnold> ah thanks

 14:47 <slyon> I really like the <name>.orig-vendor.tar.xz approach suggested by the foundations/toolchain people and used by s390-tools. I'll double-check that and try to update the docs accordingly by next week.

 14:47 <slyon> So I'll keep this a pending for now

 14:47 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:48 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:48 <slyon> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:48 <sarnold> there's some progress lately :) and some packages are in progress <3

 14:49 <slyon> sarnold: we've seen a bunch of finished security reviews this week. Is velocity picking up?

 14:49 <sarnold> yes, thankfully :) we still have large deadlines with other projects so it may not represent a new consistency but it's an improvement at the moment

 14:50 <sarnold> the lenovo wwan one is weird enough that we want that to go through the weird OEM packages process

 14:50 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lenovo-wwan-unlock/+bug/2058192

 14:51 <slyon> who would we need to ping about this?

 14:51 <sarnold> very good question :)

 14:52 <slyon> sarnold: can you check back with the reporter (dirksu) about this?

 14:52 * joalif arrived late to the party

 14:53 <sarnold> slyon: I think they've got even less experience, heh :/

 14:53 <joalif> slyon ack, I can take it

 14:53 <slyon> thx joalif

 14:54 <slyon> sarnold: hm. so that "oem-packages-process" would be needed for what exactly? I see the package itself is already in Oracular

 14:54 <slyon> (multiverse)

 14:54 <sarnold> slyon: the idea / hope is to move it to http://oem.archive.canonical.com/dists/ instead

 14:55 <slyon> In which case we could avoid the MIR/security review?

 14:55 <sarnold> well, it's a binary blob, there's not a lot to review :(

 14:56 <sarnold> but yeah, it probably wouldn't need another look from anyone else here once it's over there

 14:56 <slyon> right. Well I have no idea about the OEM archive. Can you maybe add a comment to the LP bug and set it to "Incomplete", so we can bringt it up next time and the package owners have time to react to that comment in the meantime?

 14:57 <slyon> Oh there is a comment already

 14:58 <slyon> And they seem to be fine. I'll ping sil2100 about it in that case. He might be in the known

 14:58 <sarnold> thanks

 14:58 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 14:59 <sarnold> I thought I had one but can't remember it now :(

 14:59 <slyon> we still have 1 min left to think about it ;-)

 14:59 <sarnold> lol

 14:59 <sarnold> if the last half hour didn't bring it to the forefront I don't think anothe ten sceonds will help ..

 15:00 <slyon> heh

 15:00 <slyon> alright then. thanks all!

 15:00 <sarnold> thanks slyon :)
