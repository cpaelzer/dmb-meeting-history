 16:04 <jgrimm> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:04 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Feb  7 16:04:27 2017 UTC.  The chair is jgrimm. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:04 <meetingology> 

 16:04 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:04 <jgrimm> hi folks!  will be a light turnout as handful of server folks are sprinting on cloud-init/curtin atm

 16:05 <jgrimm> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:05 <rbasak> For reference, http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2017/ubuntu-meeting.2017-01-31-16.00.html is the last meeting.

 16:05 <rbasak> No action points there.

 16:05 <rbasak> I'll talk about minuting later :)

 16:05 <jgrimm> rbasak, ok i was about to ask you

 16:05 <jgrimm> thanks!

 16:06 <jgrimm> moving on then!

 16:06 <jgrimm> #topic Zesty Development

 16:06 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:06 <jgrimm> FeatureFreeze one week away!

 16:07 <jgrimm> anyone want to talk about anything explicitly?

 16:07 <rbasak> I've stuck squid3 and monitoring-plugins merges for review in the queue, if anyone has time.

 16:07 <rbasak> monitoring-plugins is relatively trivial.

 16:07 <rbasak> squid3 is complex but I'm reasonably confident about it now.

 16:07 <cpaelzer> I got as far as "opening the browser tab" :-/

 16:07 <rbasak> I've got some others to do. Remember to use "grep-merges" to see what you touched last.

 16:07 <rbasak> I intend to post the MPs for everything, but upload if nobody gets round to reviewing.

 16:08 <rbasak> Do we have any complex merges remaining?

 16:08 <jgrimm> nacc reviewed moin, openvpn, and python-boto for me.. i need ot rework moin, openvpn for some mostly trivial to address comments

 16:08 <cpaelzer> rbasak: for review you mean?

 16:08 <rbasak> cpaelzer: by remaining I mean no MP yet.

 16:09 <cpaelzer> ok, no not from me then

 16:09 <rbasak> I see quite a bit INPROGRESS in the blueprint.

 16:09 <jgrimm> rbasak, yes.. i'd like to understand status from everyone on INPROGRESS

 16:09 <jgrimm> its not a terribly long list

 16:10 <jgrimm> but just to make sure on target

 16:10 <rbasak> jgrimm: that's a good idea. Do you want to run through them one by one?

 16:10 <rbasak> Or just a report by-owner?

 16:10 <jgrimm> maybe by owner is more efficient

 16:10 <rbasak> There are also some unassigned TODOs that are FF-sensitive.

 16:11 <cpaelzer> I need to recheck on liblockfile

 16:11 <jgrimm> rbasak, some of those are 'nice to haves', where i think that is true i'll probably move out of the list

 16:11 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, would you like to go first

 16:11 <cpaelzer> for DPDK you all have seen my current stalling on ubuntu-devel

 16:11 <cpaelzer> qemu is stuck on a nova test, but coreycb and zul look into that

 16:11 <rbasak> So for me: squid3: done, MP pending. monitoring-plugins not listed but also done, MP pending. I have capacity now. I was going to hit up as much as I could remaining.

 16:11 <cpaelzer> all else done

 16:11 <rbasak> I noticed a minor dovecot bump in Debian that could do with re-merging (upstream microrelease).

 16:12 <jgrimm> #https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-z-server-core

 16:12 <jgrimm> rbasak, i asked cpaelzer to take dovecot remerge

 16:12 <rbasak> OK.

 16:12 <coreycb> zul, you still working on that ^^?

 16:13 <zul> coreycb: sort of...still cant reproduce it out of autopkgtest

 16:13 <rbasak> Also, I want to gather all the upload tags and get them into the importer repo. I have an item on my todo to sort that. So if everyone could just keep their outstanding ones lying around somewhere ready for my collection, that'd be great :)

 16:13 <nacc> rbasak: it's relatively important to do that promptly now

 16:13 <coreycb> cpaelzer, we'll get to it, we're way backed up on openstack release stuff

 16:13 <nacc> rbasak: as the importer will not integrate them at import-time if they're not there, and it's running automatically

 16:14 <rbasak> nacc: I'm not too worried if they don't get integrated, as long as they're there.

 16:14 <cpaelzer> I found my liblockfile status - in fact I tihnk it can become a sync

 16:14 <rbasak> If we do really want them integrated now, then we should sort where they're being collected from ASAP.

 16:14 <nacc> rbasak: ok, just makes re-merging non-trivial :)

 16:14 <cpaelzer> but the remaining Delta is all about special cross compilation, and the new versions are iterating fast

 16:15 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, i'll trust you are on it.

 16:15 <cpaelzer> that said I sent to infinity and doko but didn't hear yet

 16:15 <cpaelzer> currently I'd think we better keep it stable as it was for 5 years and sync early next cycle

 16:15 <cpaelzer> I get in touch with both again to get an ack on that

 16:15 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, ack

 16:16 <jgrimm> rbasak, did you have anything else.

 16:16 <rbasak> No that's all from me.

 16:16 <rbasak> Oh

 16:16 <jgrimm> rbasak, will you pick up some of the untaken packages then?

 16:16 <rbasak> What about the unassigned work items that are FF sensitive?

 16:16 <rbasak> Right.

 16:16 <rbasak> Sure. Shall I take one at a time, so as not to lock out others who might have capacity?

 16:16 * nacc is working on ldb/samba today

 16:16 <rbasak> Since I haven't looked at how big they are yet.

 16:17 <nacc> as we have a critical bug on samba

 16:18 <jgrimm> rbasak, nss, libpam-mount, and sorting the sssd related MIR seem to be the last bits unowned

 16:18 <rbasak> OK

 16:18 <jgrimm> the numad for qemu is essentially DONE

 16:18 <jgrimm> i just need to fix the blueprint to reflect, and as nacc said he is already working on ldb

 16:19 <jgrimm> so.. we have owners for most items.. that being said, i probably need to rescan what has come in since I last refreshed the list

 16:19 <nacc> jgrimm: yeah, sorry, have been heads-down on iscsi, will focus on getting caught up on merges the rest of the week and then bugs next week

 16:19 <jgrimm> nacc, thanks.. right we want to hit the merges hard this week for FF deadline

 16:20 <jgrimm> caribou, around?

 16:20 <caribou> yes

 16:20 <jgrimm> nut merge?

 16:20 <caribou> didn't have time to look at it, sorry

 16:21 <jgrimm> caribou, no worries. just wanted to see if its still on your radar.. able to get in before FF?

 16:21 <caribou> jgrimm: hoping so but UA workload is rather heavy these days

 16:22 <jgrimm> caribou, do you recall whether its big/little effort?

 16:22 <caribou> jgrimm: yes, not that big

 16:22 <jgrimm> i know it has been a long time since you've looked at it, but gauging whether its worth someone else picking up

 16:22 <jgrimm> caribou, ok.. i can snag it if you'd like?

 16:23 <jgrimm> you can be a reviewer! :)

 16:23 <caribou> jgrimm: I think that rbasak had already had a look at the merge and there was a tag missing or something

 16:23 <caribou> lemme check

 16:23 <jgrimm> caribou, ok, yes if its close that would be nice to knock out

 16:23 * rbasak doesn't recall

 16:23 <jgrimm> rbasak, was early in cycle iirc

 16:24 <jgrimm> rbasak, oh there is the MIR bug you opened against parallax to look at too

 16:25 <jgrimm> rbasak, MIR or otherwise resolve parallax (LP: #1653959): TODO

 16:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1653959 in parallax (Ubuntu) "[MIR] parallax, dependency of crmsh" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1653959

 16:25 <rbasak> Yeah that does need sorting.

 16:25 <jgrimm> caribou, we can come back to you at the end wrt what to do with 'nut'

 16:25 <caribou> jgrimm: btw, the MIR for tomsfastmath should turn the clamav merge into a straight sync

 16:26 <jgrimm> caribou, oh.. i thought that was done already

 16:26 <jgrimm> still universe. :(

 16:27 <cpaelzer> well it only gets to main once something pulls it in

 16:27 <cpaelzer> what is the status of the mir itself?

 16:27 <jgrimm> caribou, Fix Committed!

 16:27 <jgrimm> so my memory isn't failing me as bad as i thought

 16:27 <cpaelzer> so that should me one could trigger the sync now right?

 16:28 <jgrimm> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tomsfastmath/+bug/1619239

 16:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1619239 in tomsfastmath (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tomsfastmath (runtime dependency of clamav)" [High,Fix committed]

 16:28 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, sounds good

 16:28 <caribou> jgrimm: yes, but what is triggering the move from Universe to Main ?

 16:28 <rbasak> Is that MIR actually ready to go?

 16:28 <rbasak> It's not clear to me from the bug comments.

 16:28 <rbasak> I'll ask in #ubuntu-devel.

 16:29 <rbasak> But if it is, then we just sync, right?

 16:29 <jgrimm> i believe that is what caribou is saying

 16:30 <cpaelzer> caribou: in case it is read the upload of something in main that depends on it will cause a component mismatch, but the AA will find the MIR and move it (experts please trump my knowledge here)

 16:30 <cpaelzer> s/read/ready/

 16:30 <rbasak> Right.

 16:31 <jgrimm> ok.. anything else for FF milestone?

 16:31 <jgrimm> caribou, you'll let me know about 'nut' offline?

 16:31 <jgrimm> whether you can push it along, or prefer someone else to carry forward

 16:31 <caribou> jgrimm: yep, I'm on it

 16:31 <powersj> here's my update: htop MIR is in security review; iotop, nicstat MIR are done, need to add to seed; curtin SRU exception is in review by folks on the team; ISO sizes still seem to be below limits; etckeeper merge to be done hopefully this week :)

 16:32 <jgrimm> powersj, hold on hoss

 16:32 <nacc> heh

 16:32 <jgrimm> ok, now powersj!

 16:32 <jgrimm> :)

 16:33 <jgrimm> anyone else i missed

 16:33 <jgrimm> smb, how is xen?

 16:33 <smb> jgrimm, probably still waiting on a bunch of things

 16:33 <smb> there is a 4.8 in proposed for zesty

 16:33 <jgrimm> smb, ack.. thanks

 16:34 <jgrimm> ok, anyone else with blueprint/FF related items or discussion?

 16:34 <jgrimm> ...3...2...1...

 16:34 <caribou> jgrimm: I can update on 'nut'

 16:34 <caribou> :)

 16:34 <jgrimm> ha!

 16:34 <jgrimm> go

 16:34 <caribou> https://code.launchpad.net/~louis-bouchard/ubuntu/+source/nut/+git/nut/+merge/311471

 16:35 <caribou> there was some tag mismatch that I fixed in a new branch, but for some reason another one seems to be missing

 16:36 <jgrimm> rbasak, nacc ^^ any recommendations

 16:36 <caribou> jgrimm: well, rbasak ask to push a new MP, I'll try to do it by EOW

 16:36 <jgrimm> caribou, great! thank you

 16:36 <jgrimm> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:37 <jgrimm> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-z-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:37 <nacc> jgrimm: afaict, simple typo and then use of `usd tag` and then a push of tags should fix rbasak's linter

 16:37 <jgrimm> nacc, gotcha

 16:38 <jgrimm> anything on zesty bug list for discussion

 16:38 <jgrimm> nacc, i need to follow-up on python-django as we seem to be at an impasse

 16:38 <nacc> caribou: i would also suggest deleting those incorrect tags in the process (`git push lpusip :tags/{deconstruct,logical}/2.7.4-4ubuntu1`

 16:39 <nacc> jgrimm: ack, i don't think i've seen any movement on that bug

 16:39 <cpaelzer> sorry interrupt here, I need to drop

 16:39 <jgrimm> nacc, maybe take git-workflow tooling discussion out to #ubuntu-devel

 16:39 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, ok, will take interrupt from you.. i'm assuming for SRU status

 16:39 <caribou> nacc: there is a _v2 branch with what should be the correct tags, but one seems to be missing

 16:40 <cpaelzer> progress on libvirt, libvirt (next SRU), and strongswan

 16:40 <nacc> caribou: oh ok, sorry, didn't realize that

 16:40 <cpaelzer> qemu waiting for merge to complete

 16:40 <cpaelzer> cu

 16:40 <jgrimm> caribou, please take that thread out to #ubuntu-devel

 16:40 <caribou> jgrimm: k

 16:40 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, is that it?

 16:41 <jgrimm> by your cu, i'm assuming you left the building. :)

 16:41 <jgrimm> ok, getting back on track to the agenda

 16:41 <jgrimm> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (caribou)

 16:41 <caribou> #info SRU are pending for : os-prober, ifupdown, systemd, multipath-tools, qemu, sosreport

 16:41 <jgrimm> caribou, anything new in that list?

 16:42 <caribou> jgrimm: I think that the systemd is

 16:42 <caribou> jgrimm: no, that one was there last week

 16:42 <caribou> jgrimm: so no, don't think so

 16:42 <jgrimm> caribou,  ok great!

 16:42 <jgrimm> anything for discussion here from anyone?

 16:43 <jgrimm> cool, thanks Louis!

 16:43 <caribou> np

 16:43 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:43 <powersj> Last week, finished getting ppc64el ISO testing operational. Have 3 failures working through: raid1, lvm, multi-lvm. These are test issues, not actual failures yet. arm64 node is now running tests on jenkins. Few test merge requests for curtin and cloud-init.

 16:43 <powersj> This week, sprinting with cloud-init/curtin folks. Getting those merge reqeusts in and getting the SRU exception for curtin reviewed. Expanding curtin's vmtests to run on ppc64el and s390x. Finally, trying my first merge with jgrimm.

 16:43 <jgrimm> \o/

 16:43 <jgrimm> questions for powersj?

 16:44 <jgrimm> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:44 <jgrimm> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:44 <smb> Nothing new yet for zesty. Xenial point release delayed a bit / currently working on clearing up dkms list to build with 4.8 kernels in xenial. Are there questions?

 16:44 <jgrimm> anyone?

 16:44 <jgrimm> thanks smb!

 16:45 <jgrimm> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:46 <jgrimm> netdev CFP deadline on Feb 20

 16:46 <jgrimm> anything else?

 16:46 <jgrimm> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:47 <jgrimm> as mentioned previously, handful of folks sequestered away for a cloud-init/curtin sprint in austin. :)

 16:47 <xnox> powersj, but we did have vmtests running on s390x already =) or has that regressed?

 16:48 <jgrimm> #topic Open Discussion

 16:48 <rbasak> o/

 16:48 <powersj> xnox: we have not been running them, and learned yesterday that zipl is not getting installed in images.

 16:48 <rbasak> I'd like to cut some red tape on doing minutes. As you know, I have quite a backlog.

 16:48 <rbasak> I propose to change https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server into a manual list.

 16:48 <rbasak> Containing just URLs to the MeetBot automatic minutes.

 16:49 <rbasak> So all we need to do to prepare minutes in future is add that link.

 16:49 <jgrimm> rbasak, downsides?

 16:49 <rbasak> And rely on MeetBot to generate them sensibly, and for the chair to use the #info and related commands much more to fill it out.

 16:49 <rbasak> I don't really see any downsides. The full log is generated by MeetBot and still available.

 16:49 <xnox> powersj, fun

 16:49 <rbasak> I suppose we'd have a dependency on ubottu.com.

 16:50 <rbasak> We will no longer have an opportunity to edit the minutes later.

 16:50 <rbasak> But I don't think we care enough about it anyway. The full logs will always be present for anyone confused.

 16:51 <jgrimm> rbasak, i'm not opposed..

 16:51 <rbasak> I'll JFDI then.

 16:51 <rbasak> It'll save chair effort later.

 16:52 <jgrimm> rbasak, let's try it..

 16:52 <jgrimm> and if we don't like it, we can go back

 16:52 <rbasak> Sounds good, thanks.

 16:52 <jgrimm> i'm all for eliminating busy work

 16:52 <jgrimm> any one else?   wrt rbasak proposal, or other business?

 16:53 <nacc> seems reasonable to me

 16:53 <jgrimm> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:53 <jgrimm> Same bat-time, same bat-channel.  Feb 14

 16:54 <jgrimm> and chair is..rharper

 16:54 <jgrimm> :)

 16:54 <jgrimm> thanks everyone
