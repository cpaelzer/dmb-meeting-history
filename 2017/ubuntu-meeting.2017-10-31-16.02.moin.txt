 16:15 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:15 <smoser> this is your chance to pepper the kernel team with questions or flame or troll them..

 16:15 <smoser> comon... *someone* has something here.

 16:16 <smoser> ok then

 16:17 * smoser was hoping for *something*

 16:17 <smoser> bug 1726818

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1726818 in linux (Ubuntu) "vagrant artful64 box filesystem too small" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1726818

 16:17 <smoser> to my knowledge that hadn't got any kernel team eyes. i'll just mention it so that this isnt completely empty.

 16:18 <smoser> next

 16:18 <smoser> #topic Open Discussion

 16:18 <smoser> surely someone in this lively bunch will have some topics for discussion

 16:19 <smoser> if you couldnt be bothered to troll the kernel team take this chance to troll nacc

 16:19 <smoser> surely something is wrong with ubuntu-git

 16:19 <nacc> smoser: you can't remember the name ever?

 16:19 <blackboxsw> haha, working great so far!

 16:19 <smoser> perhaps you'd like to suggest that it woudl be more efficient if he ported it to bit keeper

 16:20 <nacc> i broke the edge snap yesterday, fix pushed just now, should be available shortly (only affected build-source)

 16:20 <nacc> we had a productive git-ubuntu roadmap discussion this AM, expect to see some ML discussions on that later

 16:20 <nacc> and some blogging, i suppose :)

 16:20 <smoser> if not bitkeeper, then maybe rationall clearcase ? or CMVC ?

 16:21 <nacc> things i don't miss?

 16:21 <smoser> ok... ok... everyone, settle down.

 16:21 <smoser> remember we're  supposed to act civilized.

 16:21 <smoser> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:22 <blackboxsw> someone needs to take the coffee away from smoser

 16:22 <smoser> this concludes this weeks wild adventure.

 16:22 <smoser> tune in next week, same time same channel

 16:22 <smoser> your emcee will be none other than rbasak.

 16:23 <smoser> #info Next meeting Tuesday, 2017-11-07 at 1600 UTC, chair will be rbasak
