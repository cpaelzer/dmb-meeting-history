 15:05 <tdaitx> - preparing my server for remote access

 15:05 <tdaitx> - had the dumb idea of using yubikey through usbip, which worked like twice, until it didn't; then found out about gpg/ssh unix socket fwd support + lxd socket bind, all nice and dandy now

 15:06 <bdmurray> xnox:

 15:06 <xnox> debconf17; systemd autopkgtest reboot-tests failing debugging with laney and canonistack => hopefully have a plausible fix now; removing system upstart jobs from all the things.

 15:06 <slangasek> xnox: are those removals being done via Debian or are we getting deltas for this?

 15:07 <xnox> slangasek, some are dropping deltas in ubuntu; some is done via uploads in debian; some are uploads into ubuntu.

 15:07 <slangasek> xnox: and are you (done) ?

 15:07 <xnox> (done)

 15:07 <Tribaal> (philroche out today)

 15:07 <slangasek> tdaitx: LP: #1711026 doesn't have sponsors subscribed?

 15:08 <xnox> slangasek, version numbers for rm_conffiles matter. so hoping no-deltas for this post-18.04.

 15:08 <slangasek> xnox: yep

 15:08 <slangasek> cyphermox:

 15:08 <tdaitx> slangasek, I submitted a merge proposal "upstream", should we add a ubuntu patch to it instead?

 15:08 <cyphermox> artful:

 15:08 <cyphermox> - debugging console-setup 1.166 build

 15:08 <cyphermox> - ubiquity slideshow merge

 15:08 <cyphermox> - upstream shim PR fixups/review

 15:08 <cyphermox> netplan:

 15:08 <cyphermox> xenial:

 15:08 <cyphermox> - helped slashd with cups upgrade issue

 15:08 <cyphermox> - mostly just answering questions about maintainer scripts

 15:08 <cyphermox> - investigated jfs filesystem bug on ppc64el (bug LP: #1708096)

 15:08 <cyphermox> - it appears now to be a pretty clear kernel bug, causing filesystem corruption

 15:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1708096 in linux (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu16.04.3 Installation fails for JFS file system" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1708096

 15:09 <cyphermox> - filed bugs for ppc64el jfs install (bug LP: #1711009, bug LP: #1711011)

 15:09 <cyphermox> - tracking down MaaS and server access

 15:09 <infinity> xnox: Speaking of purging the world of upstart-related things, I noticed my systemd was "degraded" due to cgmanager not starting, removing it made life happy.  Should we be forcefully removing it on upgrade (maybe with a conflict/replace from systemd-sysv?) to avoid that problem on upgrade?

 15:09 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:09 <Tribaal> * Some more vagrant work, which funnily enough triggered a bit of a security scare

 15:09 <Tribaal> * Some bitchin' around on the build system for cloud image daillies to go out

 15:09 <Tribaal> * Fixed a bug for a GKE

 15:09 <Tribaal> * Released a test image for GKE

 15:09 <slangasek> tdaitx: we don't wait for upstream to fix before we fix build failures in Ubuntu

 15:09 <xnox> infinity, yes, i was thinking of doing that. e.g. slangasek suggested that maybe systemd should conflict with cgmanager/upstart/etc.

 15:09 <xnox> infinity, or maybe Breaks

 15:10 <Tribaal> slangasek:

 15:10 <infinity> xnox: Conflict/Replace is the only thing that will make "nice" frontends (like "apt upgrade" or update-manager) remove packages on upgrade.

 15:10 <tdaitx> slangasek, ack

 15:10 <slangasek> * continued discussions around policy for snaps

 15:10 <slangasek> * partner image work

 15:12 <infinity> * tutoring Andy on some of the intricacies of britney

 15:14 <slangasek> any questions on status?

 15:15 <slangasek> [TOPIC] incoming bugs

 15:16 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:16 <slangasek> there are some 'undecided's on there, do we need to look at those?

 15:16 <bdmurray> bug 1574670 was brought up in ubuntu-dev the other day

 15:16 <ubottu> bug 1574670 in update-manager (Ubuntu Xenial) "ubuntu-support-status returns inaccurate information" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1574670

 15:18 <slangasek> bdmurray: yes, let's take that one

 15:18 <slangasek> (trello imported already)

 15:18 <bdmurray> sure let's set an importance for the undecided ones

 15:19 <slangasek> LP: #1692870?

 15:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1692870 in zlib (Ubuntu Zesty) "gzip compression broken in UniFi (built-in tomcat)" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1692870

 15:19 <rbalint> why do we run ahead of Debian with zlib?

 15:20 <doko> to not run behind fedora and suse

 15:20 <doko> looking at that, people can't reproduce this?

 15:21 <nacc> rbalint: LP: #1664595 is the reason in the changelog

 15:21 <ubottu> Error: Could not gather data from Launchpad for bug #1664595 (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1664595). The error has been logged

 15:22 <rbalint> nacc: i don't see the delta forwarded :-(

 15:23 <nacc> rbalint: i think the only delta is the watch file and the copyright changes?

 15:24 <slangasek> yes we should commit to fixing this

 15:24 <rbalint> nacc: i think at least a wishlist bug to BTS for updating to new upstream would be reasonable in those cases

 15:25 <bdmurray> slangasek: so bug 1477455

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1477455 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Incorrect instructions leave automatic updates blocked" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1477455

 15:25 <bdmurray> is that part of the kernel upgrade story card?

 15:26 <nacc> rbalint: +1

 15:26 * bdmurray looks and it is

 15:26 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm, did we discuss this one previously?  I think my sense was that this is lower priority than e.g. fixing the kernel's actually behavior

 15:26 <slangasek> oh is it linked from that card?

 15:26 <bdmurray> its in the description of it

 15:26 <slangasek> bdmurray: I would just drop the rls-aa-incoming tag then

 15:26 <slangasek> because we'll either get that card done to completion this cycle or not

 15:26 <slangasek> (or, set the notdoing tag)

 15:27 <bdmurray> and set it to medium or low?

 15:27 <slangasek> medium sounds good

 15:28 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:28 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:28 <bdmurray> I'm out next week Tuesday and maybe Monday

 15:29 <bdmurray> So about bug 1681528

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1681528 in apport (Ubuntu Artful) "Include information about python versions" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1681528

 15:30 <bdmurray> Is there a better way then 'ls' or 'file' to check /usr/bin/python?

 15:31 <slangasek> bdmurray: readlink -f ?

 15:32 <bdmurray> okay, so using readlink and which should be good enough?

 15:32 <bdmurray> which to check for python in /usr/local/bin

 15:33 <doko> did we make any proposals for sprint invitations?

 15:33 <xnox> hmmm, kees? =)

 15:33 <xnox> all of TB?

 15:33 <bdmurray> +1

 15:34 <slangasek> bdmurray: yes, I expect so

 15:34 <bdmurray> okay, that's it from me

 15:35 <slangasek> doko: the parameters of rally attendance evolved several times, and where things landed there aren't going to be a lot of external attendees

 15:36 <slangasek> xnox: LP #1711254

 15:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1711254 in snapd (Ubuntu) "16.04.3 deployments include non-existent directories in $PATH" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1711254

 15:36 <xnox> slangasek, yes

 15:36 <slangasek> xnox: I think that's wontfix

 15:36 <infinity> bdmurray: "`which python` --version"?

 15:36 <xnox> slangasek, i wanted a confirmation that it is ok.

 15:37 <slangasek> xnox: the logic to conditionally include directories in the path relies on you running shell code

 15:37 <slangasek> which is only true if you're running in a shell.  and we need the default path set for things like gnome sessions

 15:37 <bdmurray> infinity: that wouldn't show the path e.g. /usr/local/bin

 15:38 <infinity> bdmurray: Sure, you'd want which to find the path, readlink to see where it goes, and --version to see what it is, I guess.

 15:39 <bdmurray> ack

 15:42 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:43 <slangasek> #endmeeting
