 16:07 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:07 <powersj> Last week at the sprint we spent time on cloud-init and COPR build and testing. As of last night we are successfully building in COPR nightly and running tests against the built RPMs.

 16:07 <powersj> This week I am back to working on the proposed testing, additional metric generation, and if I have time, adding additional features (e.g. email notification, reporting) to the ISO tests.

 16:07 <powersj> questions?

 16:09 * smb wonders whether he missed his ping

 16:09 <rbasak> I did, sorry. I'll go back.

 16:09 <rbasak> #info No upcoming events noted.

 16:09 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:09 <smb> Nothing to report but a question: I noticed when doing installs with artful-server daily images, that the installed system (VM) takes a long time to come up due to waiting until timeout for systemd-networkd-wait-online.service. The VM is already pingable at that stage, so it is more likely a missing event (and maybe related to trying to move to netplan). Is that known already?

 16:09 <rbasak> #info Nothing to report.

 16:10 <ahasenack> I haven't seen that yet

 16:10 <rbasak> smb: can you file a bug on that please?

 16:11 <smb> rbasak, ok, will do

 16:11 <rbasak> Thanks smb!

 16:11 <rbasak> #topic Open Discussion
