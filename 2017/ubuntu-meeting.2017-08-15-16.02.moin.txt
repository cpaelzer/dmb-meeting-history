 16:09 <cpaelzer> I've heard of partners starting more tests - but no flurry of new issues related to that yet

 16:10 <dpb1> OK, let's move on, quiet day.  Maybe the lack of a nice hot camp fire this week is bumming people out

 16:11 <dpb1> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd, ddstreet)

 16:11 <nacc> dpb1: yes, sorry, carry forward

 16:11 <slashd> Business as usual for us, the only think I can think of is this bug (LP: #1657256), if a CoreDev have some cycle to sponsor the patch from my colleagues niedbalski for devel release.

 16:11 <dpb1> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-z-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:11 <dpb1> slashd: btw, have you looked at the git-ubuntu subcommand yet?

 16:12 <slashd> dpb1, no I don't remember this discussion can you refresh my mind ?

 16:12 <dpb1> slashd: I don't think it's ever been directly mentioned to you

 16:13 <slashd> dpb1, ok I'll gladly have a look

 16:13 <dpb1> slashd: when you have spare cycles.  just read up

 16:13 <dpb1> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/Merging/GitWorkflow

 16:13 <powersj> and https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/07/24/developing-ubuntu-using-git/

 16:14 <dpb1> (the bug you raised)

 16:14 <slashd> dpb1, ack will do someone in particular ?

 16:14 <dpb1> slashd: probably start with beisner

 16:15 <slashd> dpb1, ok thanks

 16:15 <dpb1> ok, moving on

 16:15 <dpb1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:15 <dpb1> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:15 <powersj> Last week I attended DebConf17 and gave a talk on cloud-init: https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/164/

 16:15 <dpb1> woop woop

 16:15 <powersj> This week I have finished setting up the new Xenial based VM slaves for jenkins and getting back to the cloud-init KVM backend. All that is left is figuring out the right set of commands to use with subp and mount-image-callback. Running into quote hell.

 16:15 <ahasenack> what's subp?

 16:15 <powersj> python subprocess

 16:16 <ahasenack> k

 16:16 <cpaelzer> "call a command"

 16:16 <dpb1> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:16 <smb> Artful kernel: 4.12 is in proposed (but its hard to say when exactly that can get out), 4.13 in progress (waiting for some apparmor updates). Any questions?

 16:16 <dpb1> smb: what's the hard to say bit?

 16:16 <cpaelzer> smb: do you have a link what new in apparmor is coming?

 16:17 <smb> dpb1, hard to say when aa 's are happy

 16:17 <dpb1> ah, the moods of the AAs

 16:17 <smb> cpaelzer, not right now

 16:17 <cpaelzer> ok

 16:18 <dpb1> Thanks smb

 16:18 <dpb1> (oh, and thanks for the update slashd, sorry missed you earlier)

 16:18 <dpb1> powersj doesn't get thanks

 16:18 <dpb1> ;)

 16:18 <dpb1> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:18 <powersj> lol

 16:18 <dpb1> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:18 <dpb1> #link http://www.open-zfs.org/wiki/OpenZFS_Developer_Summit

 16:19 <dpb1> Any other CFPs we should call out here of interest to the server crowd?

 16:20 <dpb1> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21 <dpb1> I wanted to mention here

 16:21 <dpb1> The server team will be sprinting the week of Sep25

 16:21 <dpb1> With many other teams at Canonical, hoping to get a jump start on the 18.04 roadmap

 16:22 <dpb1> #info Any suggested things people would like to see in 18.04 on the server side, please do give us feedback on IRC, or at ubuntu-server@lists.ubuntu.com

 16:23 <dpb1> #topic Open Discussion

 16:23 <dpb1> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase#Merge_Proposals_and_Reviewing

 16:23 <dpb1> Did someone want to discuss that one this week?

 16:23 <dpb1> ^

 16:23 <ahasenack> that was from last week

 16:23 <ahasenack> just not removed

 16:23 <cpaelzer> yep

 16:23 * dpb1 nods

 16:24 <cpaelzer> and we had a few people asking how they could help

 16:24 <cpaelzer> and this is the perfect doc to point them to to start

 16:24 <dpb1> slashd: btw, that is the eventual goal (that link), making merges operate with just merge proposals and git.

 16:24 <dpb1> merges, srus, bug fixes, etc

 16:25 <dpb1> ok

 16:25 <dpb1> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:25 <dpb1> #info Next meeting Tuesday, 2017-08-22 at 1600 UTC, chair will be rbasak

 16:26 <dpb1> teward: are you available for backup next week if rbasak is out?

 16:27 <dpb1> well, we will see when the time comes.

 16:27 <dpb1> ok folks

 16:27 <dpb1> that is it for now

 16:27 <ahasenack> thx dpb1

 16:27 <ahasenack> o/
