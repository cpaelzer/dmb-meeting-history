 16:10 <smoser> bug 1722566 will have an upload today for a fix

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1722566 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "ci-info: <cloudinit.simpletable.SimpleTable object at 0x7fa98d222748>" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1722566

 16:10 <nacc> smoser: great, thanks

 16:10 <nacc> #info bug 1722566 will have an upload today for a fix

 16:10 <nacc> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:11 <andreas> I've been working on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lighttpd/+bug/1707312

 16:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1707312 in lighttpd (Ubuntu) "reload does not shut down lighttpd gracefully" [Medium,In progress]

 16:11 <andreas> and I think the fix will introduce a change in behavior

 16:11 <andreas> so I'm not sure it's sru worthy

 16:11 <nacc> #info andreas is working on 1707312, for which the fix might be a behavior change, which might not be SRU-able

 16:11 <andreas> the change is that it changes any action involving "stop" into a graceful-stop, meaning that any stop could take up to 60s (that's the timeout)

 16:12 <andreas> I've prepared test packages for the reporter to try, but in parallel I'm thinking about declaring it a wontfix

 16:12 <nacc> andreas: does it need fixing in artful?

 16:12 <andreas> yes

 16:12 <andreas> well

 16:12 <andreas> sort of

 16:13 <andreas> I can't elaborate now

 16:13 <andreas> a new upstream will make this easier, but it's not released yet

 16:14 <nacc> ok

 16:14 <nacc> shall we move on?

 16:14 <nacc> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd, ddstreet)

 16:15 <slashd> Everything is under control for us this week. Here's the list of things we are currently working on : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/25714583/

 16:16 <nacc> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:16 <powersj> oh boy lost track of time

 16:16 <nacc> powersj: np

 16:16 <powersj> last week I worked on cloud-init integration tests and making small modifications that we agreed to during the rally

 16:16 <powersj> Getting all test cases setup with KVM working, however having discussions about the use of /tmp

 16:17 <powersj> This week continuing that work and starting work on aws/gce backend

 16:17 <powersj> (hopefully)

 16:17 <powersj> will probably also need to look at ISO results

 16:17 <powersj> and make sure we are still green for release

 16:17 <powersj> questions?

 16:18 <nacc> #info QA update: last week cloud-init integration tests and rally feedback; getting all tests working with KVM (with discussions ongoing on use of /tmp)

 16:18 <nacc> #info QA update: this week: continuing the same; starting on aws/gce backend; looking at ISO results (for artful release)

 16:18 <nacc> powersj: thanks!

 16:18 <powersj> nacc: thx

 16:18 <nacc> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:18 <smb> Not much to report. 4.13.0-12.13 should be the artful release kernel, pending no last minute issues. If there are any issues found, make sure to ping the kernel team directly and not rely on us noticing bugs.

 16:19 <nacc> #info 4.13.0-12.13 should be the artful release kernel; if any issues are found, ping the kernel team directly

 16:19 <nacc> smoser: thanks!

 16:19 <nacc> smb: rather

 16:19 <nacc> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:19 <nacc> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:20 <andreas> I have nothing new

 16:21 <nacc> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21 <nacc> nothing new there

 16:21 <nacc> #topic askubuntu.com questions (teward) - Better communication with community.

 16:21 <nacc> teward: around?

 16:22 <nacc> #topic Open Discussion

 16:22 * nacc wonders if teward's entry should be removed from the agenda

 16:23 <andreas> do you remember why it's about hikm?

 16:23 <andreas> him*

 16:23 <nacc> andreas: no

 16:23 <rbasak> He's an askubuntu.com moderator

 16:23 <rbasak> And active in ~ubuntu-server

 16:24 <rbasak> But I haven't seen him around recently. Perhaps he's busy with other things right now.

 16:24 <nacc> rbasak: right, but the agenda entry doesn't idicate that, or why that needs to be on the weekly meetinng

 16:25 <rbasak> I think someone suggested that we could discuss the proposal with him at the meeting.

 16:25 <rbasak> (possibly me)

 16:25 <nacc> rbasak: what proposal?

 16:25 <rbasak> I think I've summarised it in a previous ping to him in this meeting. One moment, I'll find that.

 16:26 <rbasak> Here we are

 16:27 <rbasak> https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2017/ubuntu-meeting.2017-09-26-16.02.log.html

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:16

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:16 <rharper> #topic askubuntu.com questions (teward) - Better communication with community.

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:17 <rbasak> teward: if you're around, we were wondering about expanding bug triage to watching relevant askubuntu.com questions.

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:17 <rbasak> We were thinking about watching a tag, and it would be nice if moderators and other editors knew that it could be used to get our attention by adding the tag.

 16:27 <nacc> #action nacc to add clarification to agenda entry for AU topic

 16:27 * meetingology nacc to add clarification to agenda entry for AU topic

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:18 <rbasak> Thought about communicating with relevant askubuntu.com people early to discuss this idea, and your name came up.

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:18 <rbasak> If you're not about, we can defer to a future meeting.

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:18 <rharper> #info discussion about expanding bug triage for ubuntu-server by watching relevant askubuntu.com questions, deferring to another irc meeting

 16:27 <rbasak> 16:19 <rharper> #action re-raise askubuntu.com questions (teward) - Better communication with community discussion

 16:28 <rbasak> 16:19 * meetingology re-raise askubuntu.com questions (teward) - Better communication with community discussion

 16:28 <rbasak> Thanks nacc

 16:28 <nacc> AOB?

 16:29 <nacc> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:29 <nacc> dpb is up next, 2017-10-17 at 1600 UTC

 16:29 <nacc> #info dpb is up next, 2017-10-17 at 1600 UTC
