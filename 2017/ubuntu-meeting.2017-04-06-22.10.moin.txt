 22:10 <tsimonq2> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 22:10 <tsimonq2> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 22:10 <tsimonq2> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:10 <tsimonq2> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:11 <tsimonq2> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant.

 22:11 <tsimonq2> Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:11 <tsimonq2> #topic clvx

 22:11 <tsimonq2> Hi clvx, introduce yourself. :)

 22:11 <clvx> My name is Luis Michael Ibarra. I'm from Peru, but now I'm living in the States.  Why would I want to join Ubuntu as a contributor asked myself a few weeks back. At first, I thought .. hey it's Ubuntu, the most used distribution globally, but that didn't check out well in my mind. Then, I remembered the first time I was introduced to the Linux world. It was in a Linux conference sponsored by Red Hat

 22:11 <clvx> in a college in Lima. I was a college student in my first years at that moment. I loved Linux a lot, because of how much flexibility you can have with it. So, a friend of mine who was in that time a little more experienced installed in my desktop PC Fedora 1(I think). I started playing with gnome a lot, and learning a new world. Until that moment I was just a Windows XP user who programmed in Java.

 22:11 <clvx> After that, everything changed. I started asking many people over the years and gaining experience with a lot of screw ups using many distros. Until someday in late 2010 I tried Ubuntu after being a serious OpenSUSE user for many years. I found something reliable and simple. Little by little I started digging in the system and playing with it. I liked it a lot, because everything worked without a

 22:11 <clvx> hassle(not so true when you tried to connect to your wifi, but it was way better than the rest of distros).  Starting 2012 I got a job where Linux was my day today, and it's being like that since then. I gained a lot of experience with Linux. I gave talks about many things around technology and Linux. I asked about a lot of issues in IRC, forums and mailing lists related to Linux and Ubuntu. I was

 22:11 <clvx> answered about many of those issues. And you know, only few times I had the opportunity to say THANKS MATE YOUR TIME HELPED ME TO SOLVE MY ISSUE. I think becoming a formal contributor is more than contributing back, it's committing myself to keep helping others, so they can say THANKS MATE in return. A thank you that goes for each developer, contributor and person who helped me. I think those are the

 22:11 <clvx> reasons why I'd like to join Ubuntu as an official member.

 22:12 <clvx> My wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Clvx

 22:12 * ahoneybun drops jaw

 22:12 <clvx> yeap.. it was more than 5 lines.. =/

 22:12 <tsimonq2> That's fine. :)

 22:13 <clvx> These are my contributions: https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Lima/, https://github.com/clvx/openvpn, https://github.com/clvx/easy-rsa, https://github.com/clvx/ubuconla-lxd

 22:14 <ahoneybun> VPN stuff will be big in the states now

 22:14 <tsimonq2> Any questions for clvx then?

 22:15 <Kilos> why did you take so long to take this step clvx ?

 22:16 <clvx> I always being involved in tech communities, but I had to be sure with myself if this was something that I wanted to do. Hopefully, It is. Also, Jose Antonio Rey gave me a huge bump in my back to do it.

 22:17 <tsimonq2> clvx: Could you tell us a little more about UbuCon LA?

 22:17 <clvx> I've always been*

 22:18 <tsimonq2> clvx: And by that, I mean, your involvement with the conference.

 22:20 <clvx> yes.. I wasn't involved in the preparation of the event, in fact I just sent my talk to the organizers(in this case Jose), but during the event I joined the group, talked with peers and speaker, helped them with information around the city.

 22:21 <clvx> I also helped Jose(in that moment I barely knew him) to many little tasks that needed to be done to keep having a wonderful event.

 22:21 <tsimonq2> Ah, ok.

 22:22 <tsimonq2> Does anyone have any more questions for clvx before we vote?

 22:22 <ahoneybun> clvx: do you plan to join your LoCo at all?

 22:23 <clvx> I think there's a LoCo in Fort Laudardale, but I already met Chris(I don't recall his last name) at the Docker Orlando meetup and he's in my area. I'll contact him to make something interesting in the space coast. So, yes.

 22:24 <clvx> Fort Laudardale is a little bit far from where I am.

 22:24 <ahoneybun> I've met Chris

 22:24 <ahoneybun> yea I know we do stuff around that area and south

 22:25 <nzoueidi> o/ board and clvx
