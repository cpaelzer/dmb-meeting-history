 16:10 <rbasak> Anything to discuss on current work?

 16:10 <nacc> nothing other than upcoming FF

 16:10 <nacc> check your merges!

 16:10 <rbasak> If someone would like to take my squid3 merge, please do.

 16:11 <rbasak> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:11 <rbasak> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:11 <rbasak> Anything from this list that needs discussing?

 16:11 <cpaelzer> the qemu one will be addressed by upcoming merge

 16:11 <cpaelzer> jamespage is aware

 16:12 <ahasenack> the python django merge,

 16:12 <ahasenack> is it pending on something from maas? A +1?

 16:12 <nacc> ahasenack: hrm? the python django merge has been uploaded

 16:12 <ahasenack> shouldn't it be fix released then?

 16:12 <nacc> i just need to update it, i guess

 16:13 <ahasenack> is it in the release pocket, or still -proposed?

 16:13 <nacc> ahasenack: no, 1.11 is still in -proposed

 16:13 <ahasenack> ok, then committed is right

 16:13 <ahasenack> and I see a comment from maas in that bug

 16:14 <nacc> right, but the reason it's in a-p is a regression in the dep8 tests

 16:14 <ahasenack> is that why django is in proposed still? And maybe openstack's horizon?

 16:14 <ahasenack> ah, ok

 16:14 <ahasenack> so we have work to do there still

 16:14 <ahasenack> do we need to reopen the bug? Or file a new one?

 16:15 <rbasak> Does someone want to take an action to sort out the django situation please?

 16:15 <nacc> rbasak: i'm doing it/have been doing it

 16:15 <nacc> ahasenack: no, that's not needed

 16:15 <rbasak> Thanks!

 16:15 <rbasak> I guess no action needed then.

 16:15 <ahasenack> ok

 16:15 <rbasak> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd, ddstreet)

 16:15 <rbasak> slashd, ddstreet: o/

 16:15 <slashd> Business as usual... Here's what we are working on at the moment -> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/25270564/

 16:15 <slashd> There is a CUPS bug fix everywhere but Xenial (it fails for Xenial) that seems to be causing some headaches (LP: #1642966).

 16:15 <slashd> I haven't read the whole details yet, but I was wondering if someone has some cycle to look at this bug before I have some cycle myself ? It is blocking any future CUPS Xenial SRU to happen.

 16:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1642966 in cups (Ubuntu Xenial) "package cups-daemon 2.1.3-4 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 1" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1642966

 16:16 <ahasenack> systemd related?

 16:16 <slashd> ahasenack, seems like it

 16:16 <ahasenack> ugh

 16:17 <ahasenack> that bug has 107 comments (!)

 16:17 <slashd> xnox had an idea on how to fix it, but he is also running out of time

 16:18 <slashd> last time I talked to him 2 weeks ago -ish

 16:18 <ahasenack> the ladnscape-client one is just needing verification?

 16:19 <slashd> ahasenack, it is currently building in -proposed, yes need verification + additional packaging QA stuff

 16:19 <slashd> testing

 16:19 <ahasenack> ok

 16:19 <slashd> ahasenack, amorphous and davecore will perform the testing

 16:19 <ahasenack> cool

 16:20 <rbasak> Shall we move on?

 16:20 <slashd> yes

 16:20 <rbasak> Thanks slashd!
