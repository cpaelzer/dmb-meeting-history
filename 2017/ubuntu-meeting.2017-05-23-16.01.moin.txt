 16:06 <cpaelzer> I have made some changes to the doc

 16:06 <cpaelzer> in regard to DPDK not moving to 17.05 in artful

 16:06 <cpaelzer> Reason is that latest Openvswitch only supportes up to the latest DPDK stable release

 16:06 <smoser> anyone else have things of note here ?

 16:12 <ahasenack> it's in the queue :)

 16:12 <ahasenack> this was just a nudge

 16:13 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:13 <powersj> Last week I think I finally closed with others in the Desktop side on ISO testing and have server ISO testing going smoothly again for now. Still work to do there to make it more robust, resilient, and visible.

 16:13 <powersj> This week working on metric collection for various ubuntu server projects and data points. Plan to also start laying out some of the proposed testing jobs in jenkins that I have wanted to do.

 16:14 <powersj> questions?

 16:14 * smoser is excited to see metric collection

 16:14 <dpb1> +1!

 16:14 <smoser> will you post links and what you have when you have them to ubuntu-server mailing list ?

 16:14 <powersj> sure

 16:14 <smoser> \o/

 16:15 <smoser> anyone have questions for mr. powers ?

 16:15 <smoser> ok then

 16:15 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:15 <smb> Progress towards a 4.11 kernel in artful is looking good, though I have no ETA when exactly it will go in. Apart from that no news. Are there questions?

 16:15 * smoser has no on-topic questions for smb

 16:18 <smoser> Anything here ?

 16:18 <smoser> Actually...

 16:19 <cpaelzer> well, sprint soon - but since it is a non public event not that important here I guess

 16:19 <dpb1> Let's do another bug squashing day the first full week of June when the Canonical server folks are sprinting?

 16:19 <ahasenack> that was my thought

 16:19 <cpaelzer> that is a good idea

 16:19 <dpb1> might be good to get that on the calendar

 16:19 <smoser> yeah.

 16:20 <smoser> i'm going to action dpb1 to do that

 16:20 <dpb1> ...

 16:20 <dpb1> taken!
