 15:14 <tdaitx> * setup tinc to access lxd containers directly

 15:14 <tdaitx> * testing vnc and pulseaudio redirection from containers

 15:14 <tdaitx> - latency is so-so (avg 500 ms)

 15:14 <tdaitx> - playing around and reducing resolution/colors/quality to improve vnc responsiveness without affecting the stuff under test (readability, right colors, etc)

 15:14 <tdaitx> - audio is okay-ish, few tests use/need it so latency does not hurt as bad

 15:14 <tdaitx> = Other

 15:14 <tdaitx> * Reproduced openjdk's (8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2) awt bug a couple times, but it is not a realiable reproducer (ie. open eclipse, hope to trigger it)

 15:15 <bdmurray> caribou: Did you see my comment about checking for other filesystems for unattended-upgrades?

 15:15 <caribou> bdmurray: yes, I scanned through the source & added /var/lib to the RequiresMountsFor=

 15:15 <bdmurray> was /boot already in there?

 15:16 <sil2100> Is robru around?

 15:16 <caribou> bdmurray: nope

 15:16 <caribou> bdmurray: think it should also be added ?

 15:16 <bdmurray> caribou: Well it wouldn't hurt.

 15:17 <caribou> bdmurray: sure, I'll add it too once I fix my systemd-helper issue

 15:17 <sil2100> I'll go ahead maybe

 15:17 <sil2100> - Snooping around systemd being blocked in zesty-proposed because of hanging autopkgtest

 15:18 <sil2100> (done)

 15:19 <cyphermox> sil2100: I will fix the nplan autopkgtests, but they're lying in that things don't work. I think it's an issue of too short timeouts given the stack of virtual devices that need to come up

 15:19 <sil2100> cyphermox: you mean the nplan tests are lying, right? Since besides those we also have systemd tests failing for unknown reasons I guess

 15:20 <cyphermox> yes

 15:20 <sil2100> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1672542

 15:20 <sil2100> cyphermox: ok, thanks, that would fix part of the issues then

 15:20 <cyphermox> I wouldn't know about the systemd tests but if you need help don't hesitate

 15:21 <sil2100> Sure, I only recently started looking, don't know much about the tests yet

 15:21 <sil2100> But will poke in case of any issues

 15:22 <sil2100> Will have to try and reproduce this in some safe environment where I can easily revert packages and find out which ones cause all those problems

 15:23 <bdmurray> Is it AOB time?

 15:24 <bdmurray> Does anybody know how I could get some upstream to look at my gdb bug?

 15:28 <tdaitx> bdmurray, whats the bug #?

 15:28 <bdmurray> https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21324

 15:28 <tdaitx> i might be able to help

 15:28 <ubottu> sourceware.org bug 21324 in threads "gdb hangs when 'thread apply all bt full' is used" [Critical,New]

 15:28 <slangasek> cyphermox: so should we badtest all of the nplan autopkgtests right now?

 15:28 <slangasek> any other questions on status?

 15:29 <cyphermox> slangasek: yeah, probably should

 15:29 <slangasek> ok

 15:29 <slangasek> that will unblock a few things, thanks :)

 15:29 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:29 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:30 <bdmurray> Ping your friends about running for the DMB

 15:30 <rbalint> i think nama could enter ubuntu again

 15:30 <bdmurray> We had only cyphermox self-nominate :-(

 15:30 <cyphermox> I have a nplan release almost ready, should fix the tests too

 15:30 <infinity> I wish I had breakfast.

 15:30 <cyphermox> we already have a good chunk of the team on the DMB

 15:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: what if I'm good with cyphermox being on the team again? :)

 15:30 <sil2100> Who's our current systemd expert? Just so I know who I can also ping besides cyphermox in case of questions

 15:31 <cyphermox> sil2100: ENOENT

 15:31 <slangasek> rbalint: are you our current systemd expert?

 15:31 <rbalint> will file a synt request

 15:31 <bdmurray> slangasek: infinity's term is almost up too

 15:31 <sil2100> :<

 15:31 <rbalint> slangasek: afaik i'm the Tobe one  :-)

 15:31 <caribou> sil2100: what's your systemd problem, I've been knee-deep into it lately

 15:31 <slangasek> rbalint: sil2100 has questions for you ;)

 15:31 <barry> isn't systemd ownership is our hazing ritual?

 15:32 <infinity> No, that's ubiquity.

 15:32 <cyphermox> so I'm not done with hazing yet?

 15:32 <infinity> Nope.

 15:32 <cyphermox> crap.

 15:32 <infinity> Don't worry, we can haze in parallel.

 15:32 <barry> working on either one of those will make you hazy

 15:32 <cyphermox> what about the one who started and then left?

 15:32 <sil2100> caribou: there's this autopkgtest hang we're investigating, it has something to do with some of the deps in ubuntu - still looking what caused it

 15:33 <cyphermox> are we outsourcing the hazing?

 15:33 <caribou> sil2100: k

 15:33 <tdaitx> bdmurray, btw, did you report it on the mailing list as well? I didn't find anything so far there

 15:33 <rbalint> i can start focusing on systemd problems

 15:33 <sil2100> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1672542 is the bug if anything, but I'll poke you guys once I get to something actually

 15:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1672542 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd 232-18ubuntu1 ADT test failure with linux 4.10.0-13.15" [Undecided,New]

 15:33 <sil2100> (it's actually unrelated to the kernel)

 15:34 <infinity> Are you sure?

 15:34 <bdmurray> tdaitx: I didn't know that was needed.

 15:34 <infinity> Have you tried downgrading to a 4.4 kernel and it magically goes away?

 15:34 <tdaitx> bdmurray, that's what usually is needed to grab their attention =|

 15:34 <bdmurray> tdaitx: okay

 15:34 <infinity> Ahh, Freshest tried that.

 15:35 <tdaitx> bdmurray, and then ping again after a week if nobody gives it any love

 15:35 <sil2100> infinity: I didn't try, but from what Seth mentioned he tried various kernel combinations

 15:35 <sil2100> And it didn't really change anything

 15:35 <tdaitx> bdmurray, I know a couple folks there, I can ping them directly if you need

 15:35 <bdmurray> tdaitx: great, thanks

 15:39 <slangasek> anything else?
