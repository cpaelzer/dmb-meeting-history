 20:07 <meetingology> Current chairs: cariboo howefield oldos2er slickymaster

 20:08 <cariboo> Do we have anything that needs dissuasion here, such as our twoo missing forum staff?

 20:09 <oldos2er> We know why one's gone. Not sure abt the other

 20:11 <cariboo> MAFoElffen is gone because of school and work commitments, but we left things open in case he found the time for the Forum

 20:11 <oldos2er> Ah, I misunderstood, sorry

 20:11 <howefield> both genuine RL commitments, as I undersand.

 20:11 <cariboo> I guess this should be a topic

 20:12 <cariboo> #topic

 20:12 <cariboo> missing forum staff members

 20:12 <cariboo> oops that should be

 20:12 <cariboo> #topic missing staff members

 20:14 <oldos2er> Has anyone tried to email MAFoElffen?

 20:14 <howefield> I'd suggest moving to former staff and rolling out the welcome mat for both as and when/if they are able to return.

 20:15 <cariboo> that was my thought

 20:16 <slickymaster> +1 from me to that

 20:17 <oldos2er> fine by me

 20:17 <cariboo> Do we need to vote on the matter?

 20:18 <howefield> it was left to MAFoElffen to keep us in the loop

 20:18 <oldos2er> I see

 20:18 <howefield> as to how things were going for him, but no, for my part I haven't emailed.

 20:25 <slickymaster> I think one of us should mail her in the name of the FC explaining it to her

 20:26 <cariboo> I emailed her about 6 months ago, and never got an answer

 20:26 <oldos2er> Nevertheless, we should. I will if need be.

 20:26 <slickymaster> thanks oldos2er

 20:26 <oldos2er> Sure

 20:27 <cariboo> Thanks oldos2er

 20:27 <oldos2er> No problem

 20:28 <slickymaster> think that's pretty much what we had to discuss

 20:29 <cariboo> The only other thin I've got is that QIII has to buy the doughnuts, as he missed his FC meeting as an FC member :)

 20:29 <oldos2er> lol

 20:29 <oldos2er> And coffeecat can bring, obviously, the coffee

 20:30 <oldos2er> Any other concerns?

 20:30 <slickymaster> no here

 20:30 <slickymaster> s/no/not

 20:30 <oldos2er> ok

 20:31 <cariboo> So if that's it, I'm going to end the meeting.

 20:31 <oldos2er> Someone just made an appearance

 20:31 <slickymaster> cooffecat just arrived

 20:32 <coffeecat> sorry about that - something unavoidable came up

 20:32 <cariboo> no problem, I was just about to end the meeting

 20:33 <cariboo> we can bring you up to date in the other channel.

 20:34 <cariboo> #endmeeting
