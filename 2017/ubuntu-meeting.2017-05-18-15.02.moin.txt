 15:11 <xnox> ..

 15:11 <cyphermox> xnox: err, I do have miimon and xmit_hash_policy support in netplan?

 15:12 <cyphermox> is that why it's a cloud-init bug instead?

 15:12 <xnox> cyphermox, correct, but cloud-init was not passing those keys through to netplan at all.

 15:12 <cyphermox> xnox: ah, I see

 15:12 <xnox> cyphermox, and used wrong _ - between the words

 15:12 <slangasek> doko: here?

 15:12 <cyphermox> sure, alright

 15:13 <xnox> cyphermox, honestly, netplan is fine. and the macaddress thing is optional and is the only "missing" bit i found in nplan so far.

 15:13 <cyphermox> xnox: I'll upload macaddress today, probably

 15:13 <cyphermox> if all goes well and autopkgtests pass

 15:13 <xnox> all the bugs are in cloudinit Configdrive <-> netplan code

 15:18 <cyphermox> some of these only work if you're chair

 15:18 <slangasek> so no questions on status, then? :)

 15:18 <cyphermox> not really

 15:18 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:18 <slangasek> anything else for today?

 15:19 <cyphermox> well just a FYI maybe

 15:19 <cyphermox> rbalint has prepared the libd-i merge, this would affect a few other d-i components that need rebuild

 15:19 <bdmurray> slangasek: we were talking about artful-proposed and ddebs the other day and then doko noticed crash's autopkgtest failing because of that

 15:19 <slangasek> oh?

 15:20 <bdmurray> maybe it's artful-updates

 15:20 <slangasek> right, some tests look for -updates before it's created

 15:20 <bdmurray> I saw you were looking at ddeb-retriever is this fixable there?

 15:20 <rbalint> cyphermox: i can prepare some more merges for the affected components instead of plain rebuilds

 15:20 <slangasek> bdmurray: we could pre-create it there, yes

 15:20 <cyphermox> rbalint: let's discuss this later

 15:20 <rbalint> cyphermox: ok

 15:21 <bdmurray> slangasek: that seems like a good idea to me

 15:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ddeb-retriever ?

 15:21 <slangasek> or, well, raise an MP :)

 15:21 <cyphermox> slangasek: also, I noticed http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/germinate-output/ubuntu.artful/ isn't quite as fully developped as usual; but I haven't really dug in to see why.

 15:22 <slangasek> hrm

 15:22 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay

 15:22 <slangasek> cyphermox: could it be the python3 switch?

 15:22 <cyphermox> maybe, but it seems like half of it run?

 15:22 <slangasek> cyphermox: I'd suggest asking cjwatson or infinity about that one

 15:22 <cyphermox> as I said, would need to look at other places too

 15:22 <cyphermox> yeah

 15:23 <cyphermox> I just happened to notice it earlier when looking up something

 15:24 <slangasek> bdmurray: (maybe add a bug task on canonical-foundations so we have central tracking)

 15:25 <bdmurray> slangasek: Is that a project?

 15:26 <slangasek> I think we created a private project of some kind for that, yes

 15:26 <bdmurray> oh, so we did

 15:27 <slangasek> ok; anything else today?

 15:28 <slangasek> going once...
