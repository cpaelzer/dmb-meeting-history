 16:38 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:38 <leosilva> tks ppl, hope to keep the high standars on our team :)

 16:39 <jdstrand> I was out last Monday so giving two weeks status. I worked with the snappy team quite a bit on:

 16:39 <jdstrand> - 2.25 revert issues surrounding racy profile generation

 16:39 <jdstrand> - workarounds for gadget snap not influencing interface auto-connections

 16:39 <jdstrand> - various snappy PR reviews

 16:39 <jdstrand> I also worked on:

 16:39 <jdstrand> - lots of store reviews and forum requests for store actions

 16:39 <jdstrand> - greengrass-support interface (lots of investigations, apparmor namespaces/stacking documentation, various upstream apparmor discussions/bug reports, implement the interface

 16:39 <jdstrand> - updating click-apparmor and apparmor-easyprof-ubuntu projects to reflect new support status (ie, same as unity8). sync with others

 16:39 <jdstrand> - planning security team's snappy work for this cycle with ratliff and tyhicks

 16:40 <jdstrand> This week I plan to work on

 16:40 <jdstrand> - various PR reviews for fixing racy profile generation (at least bpf caching

 16:40 <jdstrand> and system-key PRs)

 16:40 <jdstrand> - respond to greengrass-support feedback and/or iterate on the policy if receive functional devmode snap

 16:40 <jdstrand> - password-manager-service PR

 16:40 <jdstrand> - file various overlay/apparmor bugs as a result of my investigation

 16:40 <jdstrand> As have time:

 16:40 <jdstrand> - finish snappy-debug changes for journald/lack of syslog

 16:40 <jdstrand> - miscellaneous policy updates

 16:40 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:40 <mdeslaur> guess it's my turn

 16:40 <jdstrand> ah yes

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 16:40 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up :)

 16:41 <mdeslaur> I just published some irssi updates

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and am working on gnutls and libiberty updates

 16:41 <mdeslaur> If I have time, I'll pick something else off the list

 16:41 <mdeslaur> that's about it.

 16:41 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:42 <sbeattie> I have an embargoed issue

 16:42 <sbeattie> I need to pick back up the sudo update I was also working on

 16:43 <sbeattie> I have some UCT tracking stuff to do, with the kernel team adding a few new kernels.

 16:43 <sbeattie> That's probably it for me.

 16:43 <sbeattie> tyhicks: over to you

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:44 <tyhicks> I've got two remaining ecryptfs patches to review (1 kernel, 1 userspace)

 16:44 <tyhicks> then I expect to make some progress on fscrypto evaluation for home dir encryption

 16:44 <tyhicks> I also want to sync up with kees and finalize one last design detail for the seccomp logging changes

 16:45 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:45 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <jjohansen> I need to catch up on upstream review, Casey has posted a new revision of his stacking patches, their is the review for Tetsuo I need to do as well

 16:46 <jjohansen> I need to poke at some bugs that I left to languish that last couple of weeks 1696552, 1696552, 1696547, 1696544, 1676565, ...

 16:46 <jjohansen> There might be a few more LSS duties to do. And I need to register, and book travel

 16:46 <jjohansen> I need to do some updating of Fate and on suse to support the snappy request

 16:46 <jjohansen> And maybe, just maybe get back to the next round of patches for upstream

 16:47 <jjohansen> I think that is it for me sarnold you back yet?

 16:48 <jjohansen> I guess not tyhicks back to you

 16:48 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: go ahea

 16:49 <tyhicks> ahead

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> heh

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I've got a firefox update to publish (and test again as well, as it was respun at the end of last week)

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> Hopefully Chromium as well - the build I tested last week has a couple of serious bugs, so hoping for a new one this week

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, a couple of embargoed issues

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:50 <ratliff> sarnold: are you back? if so, you go next

 16:51 <sarnold> I'm back, drink in hand! :)

 16:51 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place this week; finishing off xdelta3 mir today, I figured I'd re-start gdm3 mir this afternoon

 16:51 <sarnold> and apparmor patch reviews if those would be useful to jj

 16:51 <sarnold> that's it for me, ratliff?

 16:52 <ratliff> I'm in the happy place this week.

 16:52 <ratliff> my internally focused work is tapering off for the moment

 16:52 <ratliff> that should give me some time to work on Ubuntu Core 15 updates and reports

 16:52 <ratliff> that's it for me

 16:53 <ratliff> back to you, tyhicks

 16:53 <tyhicks> thanks
