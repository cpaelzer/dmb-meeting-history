 16:11 <ahasenack> moving on

 16:11 <ahasenack> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd, ddstreet)

 16:11 <slashd> Business as usual : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24963994/ One of the hot topic in STS is the 'pcp' pkg MIR: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNd6cPJSIIN_lzmJKUPWb0K9rnaeYo3APebH3bkXF8E/view  .We already had some good inputs from cpaelzer and sil2100 but I have invited dgadomski to join the meeting to discuss further about the MIR with the keys persons if appropriate for this meeting.

 16:12 <dgadomski> hello everyone

 16:12 <cpaelzer> hi

 16:12 <slashd> cpaelzer, I know you look at our template already

 16:13 <slashd> any concerned ? do you think we are on the good track

 16:13 <slashd> ?

 16:13 <cpaelzer> well I have two open issues which are noted so far but not yet solved (needs more time)

 16:13 <slashd> dpb1, did you look Brooks' email for approval ?

 16:13 <dpb1> Yes, I was letting it sit a few days waiting for others on the team to have their chance

 16:13 <slashd> dpb1, sound good

 16:14 <ahasenack> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-z-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:14 <slashd> cpaelzer, what should be our focus ? fix the bug for now ?

 16:14 <slashd> #info SRU pending for : percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5, rsyslog, autofs5, percona-xtradb-cluster-5.6 percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5, multipath-tools, open-iscsi, nfs-utils, ksh

 16:14 <cpaelzer> To get a formal ack I'd want to see somebody step up and drive dep8 tests, manual tests and fixes of anything you have found plus what I (and debian bug reports) reported

 16:15 <cpaelzer> that is approx 1-2 weeks of work plus the push through to Debian and a resync

 16:15 <ahasenack> do I need to echo that info or was it accepted silently?

 16:15 <cpaelzer> the acceptance in Debian would also prove some of the concern that it isn't that actively maintained there

 16:15 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: for me it shows up in an extra channel to be accepted

 16:15 <ahasenack> ok

 16:15 <dpb1> ahasenack: you have to provide a #link yes

 16:16 <slashd> dgadomski, any question for the server team about the MIR ?

 16:16 <cpaelzer> slashd: dgadomski: also the follow on MIR is kind of untouched

 16:16 <slashd> anyting you want to add or address

 16:16 <cpaelzer> I reported that you need one for <package I don't remember> but that will be part of the scope as well

 16:16 <dgadomski> yes, from what I read in the feedback those are the things that need to be fixed:

 16:16 <cpaelzer> so the full drill once more - bugs, cve's, maintenance status, upstream status, tests in place ... ?

 16:17 <dgadomski> debian bug #805955, startup scripts (try to use the systemd services present in upstream)

 16:17 <ubottu> Debian bug 805955 in src:pcp "pcp: FTBFS when built with dpkg-buildpackage -A (no binary artifacts)" [Serious,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/805955

 16:17 <dgadomski> is there anything else that we should focus on at this point?

 16:18 <cpaelzer> yes

 16:18 <cpaelzer> 1. the extra MIR I mentioned

 16:18 <cpaelzer> 2. <no bug # yet>: add dep8 tests to all of the various binraries of pcp

 16:18 <cpaelzer> honestly I just typed their names and one of them segfaulted

 16:18 <cpaelzer> that is what I meant with "I'd want to see somebody step up and drive dep8 tests, manual tests and fixes of anything you have found plus what I (and debian bug reports) reported"

 16:19 <cpaelzer> dgadomski: ^^

 16:19 <dgadomski> ok, we will add this to our list, thank you

 16:19 <cpaelzer> dgadomski: and one more thing

 16:19 <cpaelzer> what is your target - artful?

 16:19 <cpaelzer> or 18.04?

 16:19 <cpaelzer> it wasn't listed int he doc I saw

 16:20 <dgadomski> I believe it's artful

 16:20 <cpaelzer> well then hurry up :-)

 16:20 <ahasenack> #info pcp MIR: 1. the extra MIR I mentioned (<cpaelzer> I reported that you need one for <package I don't remember> but that will be part of the scope as well); 2. <no bug # yet>: add dep8 tests to all of the various binraries of pcp

 16:20 <cpaelzer> thanks ahasenack

 16:20 <ahasenack> silent bot

 16:21 <dpb1> shhh

 16:21 <ahasenack> ok, so z bugs, long list, but many fix committed (cloud-init mostly)

 16:21 <slashd> cpaelzer, any crucial date ? deadline ?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> dgadomski: reach out to me at any time if there are questions

 16:21 <dgadomski> cpaelzer: I appreciate it, thank you

 16:21 <cpaelzer> slashd: deadline is to get all that was mentioned into Debian so that it is autosynced before the auto-sync is stopped

 16:21 <cpaelzer> let me check

 16:21 <ahasenack> back to mir

 16:22 <cpaelzer> All mentioned in Debian before 23th August, and a formal MIR bug on both packages with Ack of the security Team

 16:22 <cpaelzer> and a Team that says yes to maintain it

 16:22 <slashd> cpaelzer, ack ok I think that cover the MIR topic for now

 16:23 <cpaelzer> again you might need dpb1's ack for pcp if he wants us to do, but I'm not sure on the extra dep

 16:23 <dpb1> dep8, segfaults, and the other dep are non-negotiable

 16:23 <slashd> cpaelzer, there is another thread between mgmt about this

 16:23 <slashd> dpb1, ack

 16:23 <slashd> sound good I think we now know the next step dgadomski anything else ?

 16:23 <cpaelzer> extra dep is libpapi5 FYI

 16:24 <dpb1> #info pcp has another dep: libpapi5 that would also need a MIR

 16:24 <ahasenack> #info pcp MIR: <dpb1> dep8, segfaults, and the other dep are non-negotiable

 16:24 <ahasenack> #info <cpaelzer> extra dep is libpapi5 FYI

 16:24 <ahasenack> geez, who is running this? :)

 16:24 <dpb1> BOOM!

 16:24 <slashd> ;)

 16:24 <rbasak> Sounds like dpb1 just volunteered to chair the next meeting :-P

 16:25 <ahasenack> he liked it so much last week

 16:25 <nacc> *all* future meetings

 16:25 <nacc> that's what I heard

 16:25 <ahasenack> linkedin skill

 16:25 <slashd> thanks guys I think that's it for the MIR

 16:25 * dpb1 ignores peanut gallery

 16:25 * ahasenack waits just to be sure

 16:25 <dpb1> lol

 16:26 <ahasenack> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-x-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:26 <ahasenack> x bugs

 16:26 <ahasenack> anything to highlight?

 16:27 <slashd> not for me thanks

 16:27 <ahasenack> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:27 <powersj> Last week I released the new cloud-init CI system and spent a good deal of time getting through cloud-init SRU verification, and ended week submitting 3x jenkins-launchpad-plugin merge requests

 16:27 <powersj> This week already worked on cloud-init and curtin SRUs. Plan to do some KPI work, but squash day tomorrow, and get back to proposed testing later this week.

 16:27 <powersj> questions?

 16:27 <ahasenack> bug squash I hope

 16:28 <ahasenack> do you have a link to the announcement?

 16:28 <powersj> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2017-June/007551.html

 16:28 <ahasenack> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2017-June/007551.html

 16:28 <ahasenack> thx

 16:29 <ahasenack> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:29 <smb> Not much to report as I was mostly collar deep in sh..iny recovery work to have the problems caused by initial fixes for the kernel stackclash issue replaced by latest upstream versions. We are working hard to get this out as soon as possible but things take time.

 16:29 <smb> Are there questions otherwise?

 16:29 <ahasenack> thx smb

 16:29 <ahasenack> #topic Update on new Triage Process (cpaelzer)

 16:30 <ahasenack> cpaelzer: anything to update?

 16:30 <cpaelzer> ?

 16:30 <cpaelzer> was that meant to cover the expiration bugs

 16:30 <dpb1> think so, yes

 16:30 <cpaelzer> I think so

 16:30 <ahasenack> I think just a general check point

 16:30 <cpaelzer> so I myselv covered 3 of them

 16:30 <cpaelzer> but I saw some working on others

 16:30 <cpaelzer> to get a sane tracking please once you handled one please click the checkbox in

 16:31 <cpaelzer> https://trello.com/c/txK0T1is

 16:31 <dpb1> wow

 16:31 <cpaelzer> other than that - please at least on your triage duty day do 1-3 of them

 16:31 <cpaelzer> or we will carry them what feels like forever

 16:31 <ahasenack> #info when working on a bug from the backlog, please check https://trello.com/c/txK0T1is

 16:31 <cpaelzer> I can only ask you and try to go by example

 16:32 <cpaelzer> so for now - info "clearing backlog started, but progress is still too slow"

 16:32 <ahasenack> #info clearing backlog started, but progress is still too slow

 16:32 <cpaelzer> also in case you ran out or are not in the mood for fixes on the bug squash - clearing those old things is bug squash as well

 16:33 <ahasenack> the script listed this bug to me today:

 16:33 <ahasenack> Bugs in backlog and not touched in 180 days

 16:33 <ahasenack> Found 1 bugs

 16:33 <ahasenack> LP: #1572132 - (New)            [samba]          - SMB driver (SMBv2) does not show all files when mounting a windows top level share

 16:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1572132 in samba (Ubuntu) "SMB driver (SMBv2) does not show all files when mounting a windows top level share" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1572132

 16:33 <ahasenack> would that be in that card?

 16:33 <ahasenack> a quick ctrl-f didn't find it

 16:34 <nacc> i think the card is only the "old" old backlog

 16:34 <nacc> as in our baseline of oldest bugs

 16:34 <ahasenack> >= 180?

 16:34 <nacc> not the ones that will occur (potentially) each day running the script after that first day we decided to

 16:34 <dpb1> ah, not the freshly-new-old bugs.

 16:34 <nacc> cpaelzer: is that correct?

 16:34 <nacc> dpb1: right, that's my thinking

 16:34 <ahasenack> ok

 16:35 <ahasenack> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:35 <ahasenack> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:35 <ahasenack> I added ZFS to the list:

 16:35 <ahasenack> it's a two-day quickie

 16:35 <ahasenack> one day for presentations, the other day for a hackathon

 16:36 <cpaelzer> nacc: correct

 16:36 <cpaelzer> that is the very old backlog

 16:36 <cpaelzer> sorry for the delay

 16:36 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: don't run so fas

 16:36 <cpaelzer> t

 16:36 <ahasenack> this ain't dpb

 16:39 <ahasenack> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:39 <powersj> Can we skip next week or have cpaelzer run it due to a certain US holiday...
