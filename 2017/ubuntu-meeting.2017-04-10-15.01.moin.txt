 15:01 <cyphermox> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:01 <cyphermox> rbasak to add slashd to the new SRU-UPLOADERS team (carried-over, pending TB action)

 15:02 <cyphermox> what is the status with that, still pending?

 15:02 <rbasak> Still pending a TB action.

 15:02 <rbasak> They seemed to have missed it in their last meeting.

 15:03 <cyphermox> do they have a bug for that?

 15:03 <cyphermox> oh ok

 15:03 <rbasak> Their next meeting is tomorrow I believe.

 15:03 <rbasak> So I intend to chase again then.

 15:03 <cyphermox> ack

 15:03 <rbasak> Indeed there is a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bug/1674440

 15:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1674440 in ubuntu-community "[TB/DMB] ACL for ~ubuntu-sru-developers" [Undecided,New]

 15:03 <cyphermox> I'll skip ~mapreri's, I saw the bug and it's still open

 15:03 <rbasak> Unfortuntely their process it to look for bugs there assigned to the tech board, and only they have persmission to do that it seems.

 15:03 <bdmurray> rbasak: can you ask them about that tomorrow too?

 15:03 <cyphermox> hehe

 15:04 <cyphermox> I can go to that meeting

 15:04 <rbasak> bdmurray: ack

 15:04 <cyphermox> I already watch them

 15:04 <cyphermox> next: rbasak to sort Aron's request

 15:04 <mapreri> wow

 15:04 <rbasak> I'm sorry Aron, I've failed at that.

 15:04 <rbasak> Please carry over.

 15:04 <cyphermox> zug zug!

 15:05 <cyphermox> everything else is marked done

 15:05 <rbasak> Or did someone else take that in the end?

 15:05 <rbasak> I don't recall having it as an action for me.

 15:05 <mapreri> Question: shouldn't those bugs be at the very least subscribe the TB?

 15:05 <rbasak> In any case, I'll sort out what's going on.

 15:05 <mapreri> s/be//

 15:05 <cyphermox> rbasak: I'm just relaying what's on the agenda :/

 15:05 <rbasak> mapreri: perhaps. I did email the tech board directly with the bugs.

 15:05 <rbasak> cyphermox: understood :)

 15:05 <cyphermox> do you want me to look at it instead?

 15:06 <rbasak> I can't remember what it is.

 15:06 <mapreri> oh well, fine

 15:06 <cyphermox> ok

 15:06 <cyphermox> mapreri: we'll pester them tomorrow :)

 15:06 <mapreri> I could probably just get more involved in more core stuff and get core-dev :P

 15:06 <cyphermox> or if I catch a second, I'll ask someone directly

 15:06 <rbasak> mapreri: please do :-)

 15:06 <cyphermox> ok; moving on

 15:07 <cyphermox> I'm going "fast" because bdmurray is on a time limit; and we have lots to review

 15:07 <cyphermox> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 15:07 <cpaelzer> rbasak: cyphermox: FYI - mail sent

 15:07 <cyphermox> ta

 15:09 <cyphermox> #subtopic Christian Ehrhardt's multipath-tools PPU; and postgres PPU

 15:09 <cpaelzer> and MOTU?

 15:09 <cyphermox> we shoudl review PPU separately

 15:09 <cpaelzer> or is that a seperate chunk of deciding in terms of PPU

 15:09 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:09 <cyphermox> ^ I think given the various applications though, both PPU at the same time seems like an optimisation.

 15:09 <cpaelzer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChristianEhrhardt/MultipathToolsPPUApplication

 15:09 <bdmurray> Speaking of optimization I'm ready to vote

 15:09 <cpaelzer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChristianEhrhardt/PostgresPPUApplication

 15:10 <cyphermox> now we're talkin'.

 15:10 <rbasak> I have the pleasure of working with cpaelzer. I don't remember being asked for an endorsement, but he has mine for all three applications.

 15:10 <cpaelzer> rbasak: I didn't ask to not compromise you here for the decision

 15:10 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: I asked because he is Mr. Multipath

 15:10 <rbasak> Fair enough

 15:10 <rbasak> You're getting one here anyway :-P

 15:10 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: fwiw you should not feel like I "own" multipath-tools

 15:10 <rbasak> cpaelzer is diligent in his work, always asks when unsure, and his uploads are of very high quality.

 15:10 <cyphermox> then we

 15:11 <rbasak> So I'm happy to endorse him for all three applications, and I have no further questions and am ready to vote.

 15:11 <cyphermox> uggh

 15:11 <cyphermox> then we're all ready to vote?

 15:11 <cyphermox> sil2100 ?

 15:11 <sil2100> I think I don't have any questions myself

 15:11 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: I do have one.

 15:11 <bdmurray> I may have one question

 15:11 <sil2100> Since I also had some experience in reviewing cpaelzer's uploads from the SRU queue

 15:11 <cyphermox> ok

 15:12 <cyphermox> bdmurray: you first.

 15:12 <sil2100> (and sprinting)

 15:12 <bdmurray> pitti says that there were some regressions in the last round of postgresql SRUs. How can that be avoided going forward?

 15:13 <cpaelzer> yeah that was "fun" for certain degrees of fun - pitti promised "there would never be some" and just on the first we took over we broke the rule :-)

 15:13 <cpaelzer> for the details that was on the MRE updates

 15:13 <cpaelzer> the stable releases changed parts that primarily affected testcases

 15:14 <cpaelzer> bdmurray: on these in particular there is not much to prevent them other than testing in advance which we did this time as well

 15:14 <cpaelzer> we knew about them from the dep8 tests on bileto IIRC

 15:14 <cpaelzer> and I worked through the dependent packages to adapt testcases were needed

 15:14 <rbasak> Did these regressions hit the updates pocket? It's not clear to me from the bug.

 15:14 <cpaelzer> it was in some sense dep8 only regressions rbasak

 15:14 <cpaelzer> so it was stopped in -proposed

 15:15 <cpaelzer> we analyzed and cleaned up

 15:15 <rbasak> Ah OK, thanks.

 15:15 <cpaelzer> and from there things become green and good again

 15:15 <cpaelzer> bdmurray: there is one thing we can improve on thou

 15:15 <cpaelzer> which this time was less optimal since this was our first take over from pittei (our = nacc + me)

 15:15 <cpaelzer> we could have started about 2 days earlier to see it sooner

 15:16 <cpaelzer> but that was all I'd think on this special case

 15:16 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: how did you get so tall?

 15:16 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: or how come am I so short?

 15:16 <bdmurray> cyphermox: I think its too late for you

 15:16 <cyphermox> ;)

 15:16 <bdmurray> cpaelzer: Okay, thanks

 15:16 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: honestly - stretch while going to sleeping and wishing to grow

 15:16 <cyphermox> ready to vote?

 15:16 <cyphermox> bdmurray has a point, too late for me.

 15:21 <cyphermox> ok, next up is Robert Jennings

 15:21 <rcj> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/rcj/PerPackageUploadUbuntuCloud

 15:21 <cyphermox> #topic Robert Jennings PPU application for Ubuntu Cloud packageset

 15:21 <cyphermox> rcj: please introduce yourself :)

 15:22 <rcj> Hello.  I've been working on delivery of public cloud images for 3 years and doing packing-related work for those images like open-vm-tools and livecd-rootfs (not in this packageset)

 15:23 <rcj> and drop-in fixes when I find them

 15:24 <rcj> I'm applying for PPU rights for UbuntuCloud to service those packages related to image delivery.

 15:24 <rbasak> The last sponsored upload you made to this package was 2016-04-25, right?

 15:24 <rbasak> to this packageset

 15:24 <rcj> That is correct

 15:25 <rbasak> Is there any reason you haven't uploaded more recently? Eg. no need, or others have been doing it? And how often do you expect you'll need to upload in the near future?

 15:26 <rcj> A lot of our work is geared toward the infrastructure for delivery.  But we have also grown our team and spread out the packaging work to train others.

 15:26 <rcj> I expect that uploads will increase however in the near future due to changing workload.

 15:27 <sil2100> rcj: any reason you want to have the upload rights now instead after doing some sponsored uploads?

 15:28 <rbasak> Also AFAICT arges sponsored you last in 2015, and that's the only sponsoring endorser on this application.

 15:29 <rcj> sil2100: I am looking to help out with uploads to provide coverage for the public cloud team

 15:29 <sil2100> We usually prefer that people get upload rights granted after they already have some experience through packages that are sponsored by others

 15:32 <rcj> My sponsored uploads are not as current as I'd like, yes

 15:32 <cyphermox> fwiw, based on the uploads I've reviewed, I'm +0 on this application; I think there isn't much more necessary to make me +1; but there are quite few uploads in general

 15:32 <cyphermox> that said; the cloud packageset is special in that AFAIK, it doesn't change much

 15:33 <rcj> And packages like walinuxagent are specific to the environments we directly support

 15:34 <cyphermox> cloud-init though has been +1d by smoser.

 15:34 <rbasak> I'm afraid I'm currently -1

 15:35 <rbasak> We haven't gotten to asking you questions about general Ubuntu development knowledge.

 15:35 <rbasak> But at a minimum I usually expect to see recent sponsored uploads.

 15:36 <rbasak> Is there any reason this case is exceptional? Are you having any difficulty in finding sponsors, for example?

 15:38 <rcj> We are having some troubles and I was asked to bring this forward.  When my uploads were more current I had been told to hold off.

 15:38 <cyphermox> rcj: how come? seems to me like you could ask just about anyone in your team.

 15:38 <cyphermox> (such as me, I sponsor lots of stuff)

 15:40 <rcj> cyphermox: Yes, including the larger team helps.  The desire is to have an additional person with PPU on the cloud delivery team as well.

 15:41 <cyphermox> right

 15:41 <rbasak> That's definitely a worthwhile goal.

 15:42 <rbasak> But the way to achieve that is to have you work with a sponsor for a while, so that we can be confident that you understand the details for this particular set of packages.

 15:42 <rcj> I can take this back, work on additional sponsored uploads, and bring it forward with further endorsements.

 15:43 <rbasak> I think even one endorsement is fine, if that sponsor has been working with you closely and recently on a representative sample of the work.

 15:44 <rcj> Thank you for the feedback.

 15:44 <cyphermox> rcj: thanks for coming up rcj

 15:44 <cyphermox> rcj: as previously mentioned, I'm always available to sponsor uploads

 15:45 <cyphermox> there are no Contributing Developer applications; so moving on

 15:45 <rcj> cyphermox: Thank you.

 15:45 <cyphermox> #topic MOTU applications

 15:45 <cyphermox> #subtopic cpaelzer's MOTU application

 15:45 <bdmurray> rcj: I'm happy to be your second choice too

 15:45 <cpaelzer> sorry, was trying to discuss dpek/libvirt issues - back with you

 15:46 <cpaelzer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChristianEhrhardt/MOTU-nis-pg-more-Application

 15:46 <cpaelzer> essentially I got to file the request for the postgres tools around PG itself, but it pops up in many regular tasks

 15:47 <cpaelzer> nis was one example but this is so old I hope nobody has to touch it too often

 15:47 <cpaelzer> but in general MOTU things showed up in our server bug triage sometimes

 15:47 <cpaelzer> when bugs start at server packages but solutions grow out of there

 15:47 <cpaelzer> also on bug squashing day activities I hit a few

 15:47 <cpaelzer> and finally on patch piloting

 15:47 <cpaelzer> which by the needs a calendar update

 15:48 <rbasak> I recall a few of these.

 15:48 <cpaelzer> is anybody taking at least the scheduling over from daniel?

 15:48 <rbasak> As well as pg-*, there's also dovecot-antispam for example.

 15:48 <cpaelzer> right that as well

 15:48 <rbasak> So I think it's about time we just gave cpaelzer MOTU so he doesn't need to keep getting exceptions.

 15:48 <cpaelzer> as I said it seems the server-work grows out of the server upload set the deeper I get into working with all of this

 15:49 <cpaelzer> and this lead me to this MOTU applications with these explicit examples, but it might jsut as well another package next week

 15:49 <cpaelzer> the former PPUs where core-dev + personal - so they didn't apply as MOTU exception

 15:50 <cyphermox> what about some of the sponsored packages; do you have endorsements from xnox or nacc to go along with them?

 15:50 <cyphermox> rbasak: same story; why not write an endorsement for cpaelzer?

 15:50 * nacc wasn't asked or forgot if he was :)

 15:51 <cpaelzer> I didn't collect all of them for endorsement - we might ping them if you want

 15:51 <nacc> happy to do it, but probably not during the meeting right now

 15:51 <bdmurray> i thought there were some endorsements on his core dev app

 15:51 <cpaelzer> bdmurray: yes, there were from when we downgraded it about a year ago

 15:51 <cpaelzer> I also started collecting core-dev reasoning bug work, but the list isn't long enough yet to show up here with that yet

 15:51 <cyphermox> well, in that case, why aren't we reviewing a core-dev application?

 15:52 <cpaelzer> you can decide the track record or not, I can paste the list of this year

 15:52 <cpaelzer> I only started in late January

 15:52 <rbasak> cyphermox: I wasn't asked, but I'm happy to provide the same IRC endorsement as I did above.

 15:52 <cpaelzer> in case you want to check a few

 15:52 <rbasak> I'm talked to cpaelzer about core dev before.

 15:53 <rbasak> Back then I wasn't sure if he had enough wide ranging stuff.

 15:53 <cyphermox> rbasak: I feel we're wasting time if there are already sufficient endorsements for core-dev and the work to show for it; then we might as well review a core-dev application; if all the DMB members here agree.

 15:54 <rbasak> I don't think cpaelzer has dealt with everything a core dev might have to deal with, for example a transition.

 15:54 <rbasak> In the past, that was holding me back from recommending that he apply for core dev.

 15:54 <cyphermox> ok, in that case, are we ready to vote?

 15:54 <rbasak> But I think I've reached the stage now that I'd be happy to endorse him anyway. He's very active in uploading, not being able to upload stuff tends to block him, and he's careful and diligent.

 15:55 <rbasak> I'm sure he knows more about library ABI matters than I do, and I supposedly have handled transitions.

 15:55 <cyphermox> we need to try to hold everyone to the same standard though; if anybody else had not done a transition, would you support a core-dev application?

 15:55 <cpaelzer> DPDK forces me to do so on that end

 15:56 <cpaelzer> btw I brought the hopefully final fix to that upstream - no next merge we will finally have saner ABI in that

 15:56 <cyphermox> given time constraints, we should vote now if nobody has questions

 15:56 <rbasak> No further questions.

 15:56 <cpaelzer> and I'll soon work with nacc on PG transition into aa so I'll get guided through my first one

 15:57 <rbasak> Sorry, I missed your question

 15:57 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1/-1/+0 #channelname)

 15:57 <rbasak> +1

 15:57 <cyphermox> bdmurray: ?

 15:58 <cyphermox> he might have had to leave

 15:58 <rbasak> if anybody else had not done a transition, would you support a core-dev application> yes, if there was enough material to weigh up to a +1.

 15:58 <sil2100> I think I saw sufficient for MOTU, so:

 15:58 <sil2100> +1

 15:58 <meetingology> +1 received from sil2100

 15:59 <cyphermox> I pinged infinity, just in case.

 15:59 <rbasak> While we're waiting...

 16:00 <cyphermox> yeah?

 16:00 <rbasak> cpaelzer tends to fix things that he touches, and I haven't seen evidence that he's ever made an error that an existing core dev wouldn't make.

 16:00 <bdmurray> sorry, +1 for MOTU

 16:00 <cyphermox> cool

 16:00 <rbasak> And he's very active across the archive.

 16:00 <cyphermox> rbasak: I know

 16:00 <cyphermox> at this point it's more trying to finish the meeting than anything else given that bdmurray could only stay for an hour

 16:01 <rbasak> So I think that perhaps outweighs my "no transition" point in a way that other applicants haven't convinced me in the past.

 16:01 <rbasak> Sure

 16:01 <meetingology> Voting ended on: cpaelzer to join  MOTU

 16:01 <meetingology> Votes for:3 Votes against:0 Abstentions:0

 16:01 <meetingology> Motion carried

 16:01 <rbasak> The 4th was from bdmurray and hadn't registered with meetingology I think?

 16:01 <cyphermox> (bdmurray's +1 is above but didn't register because it wasn't the first thing on the line)

 16:01 <bdmurray> yeah, my bad

 16:01 <rbasak> I'd be happy to take the post-meeting actions for cpaelzer

 16:01 <rbasak> Perhaps easiest as he's on my team?

 16:01 <cyphermox> ack

 16:02 <cyphermox> [ACTION] rbasak to handle cpaelzer's upload rights modifications

 16:02 * meetingology rbasak to handle cpaelzer's upload rights modifications

 16:02 <cpaelzer> thanks everybody

 16:02 <cyphermox> no SRU or core-dev applications

 16:02 <rbasak> I had a couple of items for AOB.

 16:02 <cyphermox> anythign outstanding on the mailing list first?

 16:02 <rbasak> Ah, that was one of those.

 16:03 <cyphermox> we can make it AOB

 16:03 <cyphermox> #topic AOB

 16:03 <rbasak> Iulian Udrea "Reactivation of ~iulian's membership in ~motu"

 16:03 <bdmurray> I've got to get moving but will read scrollback.

 16:03 <rbasak> Does this need a majority vote?

 16:03 <rbasak> bdmurray: thank you for attending!

 16:03 <cyphermox> does what need?

 16:03 <cyphermox> iulian's request?

 16:03 <rbasak> Yes

 16:03 <sil2100> Do we have a policy for such things?

 16:04 <sil2100> I know for short deprecations we just 'did it'

 16:04 <cyphermox> I think we should just do it

 16:04 <rbasak> Do we know how long his break is?

 16:04 <rbasak> I think we should at the least understand when and why the membership ceased.

 16:05 <cyphermox> * Iulian Udrea (~iulian) expired from motu (on 2017-01-04)

 16:06 <cyphermox> I don't know whether he has core-dev before that expired earlier, but he's also still in motu-release (assuming this is still useful)

 16:06 <rbasak> Ah

 16:06 <rbasak> That's fine then I guess.

 16:06 <cyphermox> I also do have AOB, but it's a FYI only

 16:06 <rbasak> My other team was on my email "Ordering of decisions to create a packageset and a first uploader"

 16:06 <cyphermox> ~langpack-uploader was showing up in the team monitoring emails; I fixed that to be skipped

 16:07 <rbasak> I'd like to achieve consensus on that, but nobody has replied.

 16:07 <rbasak> My other item

 16:07 <cyphermox> I think doing the work doesn't need to happen until it really does (ie there is an uploader), but we can still vote and approve a packageset before there are uploaders.

 16:08 <rbasak> Define "approve a packageset" please.

 16:08 <cyphermox> voting for it; deciding that it makes sense.

 16:08 <rbasak> For Budgie, would that mean "#vote A packageset defined as "Ubuntu Budgie" will be created?

 16:08 <rbasak> "

 16:09 <cyphermox> rbasak: I don't think that one is a good example

 16:09 <rbasak> Or anything more extensive?

 16:09 <rbasak> Well, that's the one where we ended up in a twist.

 16:09 <cyphermox> the Ubuntu Budgie packageset should be an automatic seed-based one.

 16:09 <cyphermox> otherwise a "PPU" kind of packageset for a subset of those, which is what David was asking for previously.

 16:11 <cyphermox> in that case, it probably needs that that decision be informed by both what will go in that packageset initially, what it's used for (there might be a better way to do things) and whether the person asking for it is likely to have their application approved; as if they don't, then someone else or the same person might ask for something quite different later.

 16:11 <cyphermox> but all this is probably best left for the mailing list.

 16:11 <rbasak> Please do reply to the mailing list.

 16:12 <cyphermox> is this all?

 16:13 <rbasak> That's all I had, thanks.

 16:13 <cyphermox> cool. I think that's it for this meeting then

 16:13 <cyphermox> #endmeeting
