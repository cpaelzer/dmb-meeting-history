 16:45 <mdeslaur> and I'm off on friday

 16:45 <mdeslaur> that's it for me, sbeattie?

 16:46 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place

 16:46 <sbeattie> I'm still researching cve triage process for snaps

 16:46 <sbeattie> I have some upstream apparmor tasks I need to get to

 16:47 <sbeattie> I am also monitoring kernel cves/respins

 16:47 <sbeattie> and I have a couple of other random issues on my plate

 16:47 <sbeattie> that's it for me; tyhicks, over to you.

 16:47 <tyhicks> * weekly role: happy place

 16:47 <tyhicks> * embargoed issues

 16:48 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:48 <jjohansen> I am working on making apparmor mount mediation work with the mount code rework

 16:49 <jjohansen> I will also being doing a 4.14 kernel for the kernel team

 16:49 <jjohansen> and maybe I can get some work done on updating the backport kernels

 16:50 <jjohansen> and I suppose there are several bugs to look at but I don't have any bug numbers of particular ones

 16:50 <jjohansen> sarnold: you are up

 16:51 <sarnold> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:51 <sarnold> and doing some embargoed work

 16:51 <sarnold> with libteam MIR after that, if there's time

 16:52 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> I need to finish up rust 1.22 updates this week. There are currently 3 separate failures I need to investigate, and one of these looks like it might be the "rust builds fail randomly in launchpad" issue I had last time

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> which I worked around by continually hitting retry until it built

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I've got an embargoed update to prepare

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> I should be able to look at this apparmor / audit work this week

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> that's me done

 16:54 <ratliff> I'm on community this week
