 16:05 <cpaelzer> #link https://trello.com/b/U9HhWyT0/daily-ubuntu-server

 16:05 <cpaelzer> Any current work other than bugs (which will follow) worth to discuss in a group?

 16:05 <teward> just for awareness:

 16:06 <cpaelzer> any bigger changes coming that should be made known

 16:06 <cpaelzer> ok teward go

 16:06 <teward> nginx 1.12.1 released todah - it's a headache because i already started 1.12 - delays my tasks another week

 16:06 <teward> (builds, etc.)

 16:06 <teward> 1.12.0 merge*

 16:06 <cpaelzer> teward: do you plan to go 1.12.0 first and then 1.12.1 then?

 16:06 <cpaelzer> or will go move to .1 before uploading the merge?

 16:06 <teward> cpaelzer: we're already 1.12.0 i have to finish merging in Debian's packaging changes

 16:07 <teward> probably going to finish testing that then jump to 1.12.1 direct.

 16:07 <cpaelzer> ok

 16:07 <cpaelzer> thanks

 16:07 <teward> yep.

 16:07 <teward> *returns to the shadows*

 16:07 <cpaelzer> now more bug centric - anything high profile to share?

 16:07 <ahasenack> I don't

 16:08 <slashd> Business as usual for us this week so far --> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/25068655/

 16:08 <slashd> Note that we are still working on the MIR of pcp + libpapi (dependency of pcp) : Looking at implementing autopkgtest, ...

 16:08 <slashd> #info SRU pending for : percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5 percona-xtradb-cluster-5.6, cups, sssd, open-iscsi, rsyslog, ksh, neutron

 16:08 <cpaelzer> in addition for those who wonder on yakkety, stricly speaking that has a remaining lifecycle of two days left https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

 16:09 <cpaelzer> thanks slashd, anybody else SRUs to share?

 16:09 <slashd> cpaelzer, everything is under control on our hand with regard to SRU

 16:10 <cpaelzer> If not *special* you don't need to list all as the weekly summary will include them automatically

 16:10 <cpaelzer> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2017-July/007559.html

 16:10 <slashd> cpaelzer, ack

 16:10 <cpaelzer> and for example the SRUs I had are non-special - e.g. fiixing libvirt in zesty for spice

 16:10 <cpaelzer> there are more by more people

 16:11 <slashd> cpaelzer, ok I'll make sure I only share the special one for now one, thanks

 16:11 <cpaelzer> it is mostly on listing so that people are aware that their work collide

 16:11 <cpaelzer> since your Teams work somewhat separate we might collide on that

 16:12 <cpaelzer> ok I don't here on more SRUs queued up and heard nobody complain on the ones listed by slashd to cause any trouble

 16:12 <cpaelzer> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:12 <cpaelzer> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:12 <cpaelzer> he is not here

 16:12 <cpaelzer> dpb1: is he off?

 16:12 <dpb1> hm

 16:12 <dpb1> powersj?

 16:13 <cpaelzer> he is coming

 16:13 <dpb1> he's here

 16:13 <dpb1> k

 16:13 <powersj> o/

 16:13 <cpaelzer> you are right on powersj

 16:13 <powersj> sorry for being late

 16:13 <cpaelzer> qa status please

 16:13 <dpb1> he's just being lazy

 16:13 <dpb1> :)

 16:13 <slashd> cpaelzer, that was mainly why I list everything, sometime it may raise a flag on your side

 16:13 <cpaelzer> slashd: perfect slashd - I have a proposal to that in the open discussion

 16:14 <cpaelzer> but now lets report powersj first on QA

 16:14 <powersj> Last week I worked on resolving some test failures with cloud-init and otherwise spent time on KPI related activities.

 16:14 <powersj> This week I am working on kvm-backed cloud-init integration testing.

 16:14 <powersj> I do have to bring up that the artful ISO is now over 700mb

 16:15 <powersj> I know this was being looked at as the seeds changed, but didn't get resolved, so I need to get status

 16:15 <cpaelzer> I didn't see a related seeds change when working on ubuntu-virt seeds changes

 16:15 <cpaelzer> you wil llet us know next wek

 16:16 <cpaelzer> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:16 <smb> Latest info I heard is that we are close to move to 4.11 in artful. There are very few dkms issues left (2 to fix and one to potentially remove (blktap-dkms)). To my knowledge blktap was only ever used by XCP/XAPI/open-xenserver and that is gone.

 16:16 <smb> Apart from that (not kernel related at all), doing my special kind of debootstrap installs which are adding "server^ ubuntu-server" later, I got netplan/systemd-networkd without libnss-resolve installed. Which is not too well working. Not sure but maybe libnss-resolve needs adding to either the server task or meta-package.

 16:17 <cpaelzer> that is interesting smb

 16:17 <cpaelzer> dpb1: should we forward that to cyphermox_ ?

 16:17 <cpaelzer> dpb1: or is ryan pre-handling those netplan related things?

 16:17 <cpaelzer> rharper I should say

 16:17 <dpb1> interesting

 16:17 <cpaelzer> smb: is cyphermox_ involved in your netplan findings already

 16:18 <smb> cpaelzer, not with libnss one but with my ipv6 ra issues

 16:18 <cpaelzer> ok good, because that ipv6 ra was the one I knew about

 16:18 <dpb1> smb: have a bug for that?

 16:18 <cpaelzer> the libnss you mean dpb1?

 16:18 <dpb1> yes

 16:18 <smb> not yet for that

 16:19 <cpaelzer> smb: please do so once you happen to open one up

 16:19 <smb> cpaelzer, ck

 16:19 <cpaelzer> dpb1: do you want to be sucscirbed to reroute as applicable?

 16:20 <cpaelzer> or even "subscribed"

 16:20 <dpb1> yes please

 16:20 <smb> ok

 16:20 <cpaelzer> great, and 4.11 sounds good

 16:20 <cpaelzer> smb: will 4.11 stay the aa kernel then?

 16:20 <cpaelzer> or 4.12

 16:20 <cpaelzer> or not commited to either?

 16:21 <smb> at least 4.12

 16:21 <cpaelzer> ok

 16:21 <cpaelzer> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:21 <cpaelzer> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:21 <ahasenack> I think I added a link to a lxd conference

 16:21 <cpaelzer> Openstack CFPs ahead - anybody heading there?

 16:21 <cpaelzer> there are more ahasenack

 16:22 <cpaelzer> I wanted the generic - are there any beofre listing those

 16:22 <ahasenack> ok

 16:22 <cpaelzer> ok, on the agenda as ahasenack mentioned are also

 16:22 <cpaelzer> #link http://www.open-zfs.org/wiki/OpenZFS_Developer_Summit

 16:22 <cpaelzer> #link https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/containers-micro-conference-at-linux-plumbers-2017/262

 16:22 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: do you have background on those?

 16:22 <ahasenack> just that there is still time, and the lxd one was sent by stgraber to a list and I copied it to the agenda

 16:23 <ahasenack> I wasn't sure if they were listed in the lwn.net calendar

 16:23 <cpaelzer> they are not

 16:23 <ahasenack> the zfs one is short, just one day

 16:23 <cpaelzer> intending to go anybody?

 16:24 <cpaelzer> ok not go from here, continuing

 16:24 <cpaelzer> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:24 <cpaelzer> none that I know of

 16:24 <dpb1> nothing to announce yet

 16:24 <cpaelzer> #topic Open Discussion

 16:25 <cpaelzer> I have two tihngs here, anybody els?

 16:25 <ahasenack> I don't

 16:25 <cpaelzer> First of all libvirt/qemu daily builds are out now

 16:25 <cpaelzer> we will have to see how easy (or not) they are to maintain

 16:25 <cpaelzer> but for now you got very easy verification/test packages from upstream master

 16:25 <cpaelzer> #info Daily builds on libvirt and qemu master available

 16:25 <cpaelzer> #link https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/+archive/ubuntu/virt-daily-upstream

 16:26 <cpaelzer> The other topic I have is for slashd and powersj (and everybdoy actually)

 16:26 <cpaelzer> on the mentioning of SRUs

 16:26 <cpaelzer> the intention for that is to not step on each others toes

 16:26 <cpaelzer> powersj: could the report David is sending get a list like https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+queue?queue_state=1

 16:26 <cpaelzer> filtered by "uploaded this week" and only server subset?

 16:26 <cpaelzer> That would make sure people know what is about to come - a bit like slashd reports us what STS is working on.

 16:27 <powersj> cpaelzer: so essentially report what is in proposed?

 16:27 <slashd> cpaelzer, and can we be added to this email ?

 16:27 <cpaelzer> powersj: almost - what is in proposed is kind of "too late"

 16:27 <dpb1> slashd: ubuntu-server@lists.c.c

 16:27 <cpaelzer> I'd like to see what is in unapproved even

 16:27 <slashd> dbp1, thanks

 16:28 <cpaelzer> that is about 2-10 days earlier

 16:28 <dpb1> slashd: errr

 16:28 <dpb1> ubuntu-server@lists.ubuntu.com

 16:28 <cpaelzer> so an earlier heads up for those plannign a new one

 16:28 <cpaelzer> powersj: just take a note, if it is doable that might be a good info

 16:28 <cpaelzer> if not it is not worth to invest too much

 16:29 <cpaelzer> surely everybody could check the link, and I know me and others do

 16:29 <powersj> cpaelzer: I like the idea, I'll add a card and circle back

 16:29 <cpaelzer> but you know pushing the info out might be useful

 16:29 <cpaelzer> ok great powersj

 16:29 <cpaelzer> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:29 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: forgot to remove himself after last week, I'll be so kind to do that

 16:30 <cpaelzer> I also remove myself which makes rharper next weeks chair

 16:30 <ahasenack> thank you

 16:30 <dpb1> rharper is away next week

 16:30 <dpb1> shuffle him back one week please

 16:30 <dpb1> oh

 16:30 <dpb1> n/m

 16:30 <dpb1> he's away this week!

 16:30 <cpaelzer> thats whyt I thought

 16:30 <dpb1> carry on

 16:30 <cpaelzer> ok, we elect him then

 16:30 * dpb1 disappears back into shadows

 16:30 <cpaelzer> thanks everybody
