 15:05 <cyphermox> oh, sorry about that indeed I need to sponsor your libd-i

 15:05 <rbalint> EOF

 15:05 <tdaitx> (done)

 15:05 <cyphermox> slangasek: no, that's something else more or less unrelated

 15:06 <xnox> filing sbuild MIR just now =)

 15:06 <xnox> ..

 15:06 <cyphermox> slangasek: I have a patch that fixes that too though, in theory

 15:06 <sbeattie> tdaitx: I'm just publishing openjdk-8 this morning

 15:06 <sil2100> Uh, oh

 15:06 <infinity> xnox: Moving seed to git was a TODO for Colin and I.  Should revisit it.  d-i should come with a merge o' doom.

 15:06 <sil2100> - ubuntu-image:

 15:06 <sil2100> * Finalizing some old branches for better classic confinement handling

 15:06 <sil2100> * Looking into issues with autopkgtest dying because of exceeding API rate

 15:07 <cyphermox> infinity: did you do that merge o' doom?

 15:07 <infinity> * Three day week, due to vacation last week:

 15:07 <infinity> - General SRU/AA tasks

 15:07 <infinity> - Back to work on glibc 2.25 and trunk

 15:07 <infinity> - Drove artful uninst, priority-mismatches, and NBS reports back down to zero

 15:07 <infinity> - Some more back and forth with guillem about dpkg/buildinfo

 15:07 <infinity> - Some fixes to dump build-essential from desktop to ship-live

 15:07 <infinity> - autopkgtest gardening

 15:07 <infinity> (done)

 15:07 <infinity> cyphermox: I sure didn't.

 15:07 <cyphermox> phew

 15:08 <tdaitx> sbeattie, nice, thanks! I'm planning to upload openjdk-7 today, but I might wait for doko to review it if he has the time for that

 15:10 <sbeattie> tdaitx: okay, thanks.

 15:13 <slangasek> any other questions on status?

 15:13 <rbalint> regarding moving to git maybe we could start using git commit msg convention

 15:14 <rbalint> one line subject, one empty, then details

 15:14 <rbalint> bzr style comments imported to git seem a bit crowded

 15:15 <infinity> When working on packages, I tend to just use debcommit.

 15:15 <infinity> Which doesn't at all match git/kernel conventions, but oh well.

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:17 <slangasek> anything else for today?

 15:18 <slangasek> #endmeeting
