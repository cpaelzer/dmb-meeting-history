 16:08 <rharper> #subtopic blueprints

 16:08 <rharper> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-aa-server-core

 16:08 <nacc> talked to ondrej, we'll move to php7.1 in 17.10

 16:09 <rharper> we should start updating that with items

 16:09 <nacc> and then php7.2 probably in 18.04

 16:09 <nacc> (that's sort of in the blueprint)

 16:09 <rharper> #info planning for php7.1 in 17.10, and php7.2 for 18.04

 16:09 <rharper> any other known planning items?  if not already added, please update blueprint  as you know

 16:10 <rharper> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:10 <rharper> any critical zesty bugs ?

 16:10 <nacc> i think the nm one is the big one

 16:10 <nacc> not really server

 16:10 <rharper> bug link ?

 16:11 <nacc> looking

 16:12 <nacc> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1682499

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1682499 in systemd (Ubuntu Zesty) "disable dnssec" [High,Confirmed]

 16:12 <nacc> which isn't nm, i guess, systemd

 16:12 <nacc> but nm used systemd, and that's where people were hitting it

 16:12 <nacc> (systemd-networkd i think)

 16:12 <nacc> so i imagine server would also be affected

 16:13 <nacc> i think this is high priority but probablya n upstream issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/open-iscsi/+bug/1615694

 16:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1615694 in open-iscsi (Ubuntu) "[860730] Host experiencing constant session termination and recreation while using jumbo frames" [High,Triaged]

 16:13 <rharper> nacc: thanks

 16:14 <rharper> any other items related to zesty ?

 16:14 <rharper> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads

 16:14 <rharper> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-x-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:15 <rharper> there are quite a few cloud-init sru's in-flight, smoser

 16:16 <rharper> smoser: updates there?  mostly done? a lot left?

 16:16 <smoser> all but 1 really is eitehr verification done or just about

 16:16 <nacc> nice

 16:17 <rharper> #info cloud-init SRU mostly done, one or two left

 16:18 <rharper> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:18 <powersj> Last week completed final Zesty server ISO testing, cloud-init bug triage, updated a few merge requests, lots of server team bug triage, and updated docs on server QA.

 16:18 <rharper> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:18 <powersj> This week qemu huge pages testing, few more doc updates, work on jenkins slaves, and bug day work. For bugs I'll update my SRUs and then continue focus on cloud-init and want to look at openvpn.

 16:18 <powersj> FYI did have to reboot torkoal this morning after it seemed to go unresponsive

 16:18 <cpaelzer> powersj: any huge page testing on the bug we are currently on or in general?

 16:18 <rharper> powersj: hopefully not huge page related =/

 16:20 <powersj> cpaelzer: for ericson

 16:20 <cpaelzer> ok different case

 16:20 <cpaelzer> thanks

 16:20 <rharper> anything else for powersj ?

 16:20 <powersj> cpaelzer: we should look at virt tests btw

 16:21 <rharper> powersj: cpaelzer and I had a discussion this morning about bring in some more dpdk related testing;

 16:21 <cpaelzer> what happened there they were all green

 16:21 <powersj> ok

 16:21 <powersj> yeah... not so green anymore

 16:21 <powersj> Looks like a test issue, but I wasn't sure where to start on fixing those

 16:22 <cpaelzer> powersj: I will look at it, but more likely "my" tomorrow

 16:22 <powersj> no rush :)

 16:22 <rharper> #info virt tests on jenkins not green anymore, cpaelzer to look at issues

 16:22 <rharper> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:22 <smb> Nothing to report. Not much changed since the release last week (at least kernel-wise). Is there anything anybody wants to bring up?

 16:23 <rharper> yes ,one thing

 16:23 <rharper> Bug 1682456

 16:23 <ubottu> bug 1682456 in linux (Ubuntu Xenial) "md devices may leave remnants in /sys/class/block after removal" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1682456

 16:23 <rharper> fun with md driver w.r.t references on devices leaving stuff in sysfs ... appears to be known issue upstream;

 16:24 <rharper> it's not fatal (that is, you can still create new md devices after stopping them) but somethings not quite right

 16:24 <smb> rharper, ok, yeah. I'll keep an eye on that (and upstream)

 16:24 <rharper> smb: thanks, I'm waiting on a zesty kernel with the upstream bits; I can easily recreate (the bug also has reproduce instructions)

 16:25 <rharper> anything else for smb ?

 16:27 <caribou> Since this is most probably my last meeting as part of the STS sustaining engineering team, I will ask slashd to take over responsabilities for the future meetings

 16:27 <caribou> please update the meeting template accordingly

 16:27 <rharper> caribou: ack; thanks for all of your help!
