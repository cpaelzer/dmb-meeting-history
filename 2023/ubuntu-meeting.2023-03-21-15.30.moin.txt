 15:31 <jamespage> o/

 15:31 <didrocks> hello

 15:32 <slyon> c-m is looking pretty good. inetutils is with joalif for MIR review (what's status on this?) and I've just reviewed a fix for the broken autopkgtests today

 15:32 <slyon> the fix is ready for sponorship, but pending FFe

 15:32 <slyon> mosh has been taken over by rbasak to fix the remaining blockers

 15:32 <joalif> slyon I didn't get the chance to work on it last week, I;ll do it this week (promise)

 15:32 <slyon> thanks joalif!

 15:32 <slyon> c-m-p:

 15:33 <slyon> this is looking much cleaner!

 15:33 <eslerm> does ipmitool need to stay on that list? "ipmitool repository has been locked, and its maintainer suspended, by GitHub" - https://lwn.net/Articles/926101/

 15:33 <slyon> we (foundations) were able to drop two *-perl dependencies of devscripts and I just uploaded ndctl earlier today to drop two additional deps/mismatches

 15:34 <slyon> eslerm: this is a fair point.. I think we should further disucss this during AOB

 15:35 <sarnold> we definitely should have another conversation with the maas team to see if there's a good alternative that we can invest in to push it over the line

 15:35 <slyon> for *cups we're pending security review IIRC and python-inflect is with the OpenStack team

 15:35 <slyon> sarnold: is maas the only user?

 15:36 <sarnold> slyon: probably not, but the supported-maas seed is how this is on our radar every week :)

 15:36 <slyon> sarnold: could you or eslerm reach out to the MAAS team to clarify this?

 15:36 <sarnold> sure

 15:36 <slyon> ACK. Maybe we should create a bug report which can be shared with the MAAS team, and also subscribe ~ubuntu-archive, to bringt it to the AAs attention?

 15:37 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 15:37 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:38 <slyon> bug #2001699 -> tracking update

 15:38 <slyon> bug #2007710 -> seems ready for promotion. didrocks could you double check and update the bug status accordingly?

 15:38 <didrocks> slyon: we need the FFe

 15:38 <didrocks> before doing the promotion

 15:38 <didrocks> but yeah, I’ll change the status after checking

 15:39 <slyon> didrocks: thanks! Please also mention the FFe in the comments as I think I couldn't find anything about it there

 15:39 <didrocks> well, it’s the distro regular process at this point (for the thing that will start pulling it)

 15:40 <slyon> didrocks: well... actually it looks like it already migrated. So maybe FFe is already done?

 15:40 <didrocks> but happy to write it down

 15:40 <didrocks> the thing pulling it should have the FFe

 15:40 <slyon> anyway, thanks for taking care!

 15:40 <didrocks> being either a seed/metapackage change or a dep

 15:40 <slyon> I see. makes sense

 15:40 <slyon> no other recent (past 2 weeks) updates on that list

 15:41 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:41 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:41 <slyon> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:41 <slyon> sarnold: what's the update you have for us today?

 15:42 <eslerm> I'm seeing progress on x265

 15:43 <eslerm> we requested volunteers a few times for cups mirs, I have a 1x1 today where I can raise this again

 15:43 <sarnold> alas not much progress on duktape or kea (sorry christian, when reading the logs, I've still got your dissaproving picture over my monitor) -- escalations atop escalations

 15:43 <slyon> right! there have been some discussions regarding x265 vs libde265. but it seems like they are not fit for the reverse purpose (encoder vs decoder). Foundations is currently trying to clarify this with upstream libde265

 15:44 <sarnold> we do still intend to put more time on MIRs nearer the end of the month, but there's no denying that resources are currently elsewhere

 15:44 <slyon> yeah.. we'll probably also need some cycles for inetutils[-telnet] once MIR review is done by joalif ...

 15:44 <eslerm> that's good to hear, I'm not working on x265, but theres A LOT of assembly :)

 15:45 <sarnold> eslerm: oh good :) you're the new assembly expert! :)

 15:45 <slyon> as unfortunately this already got seeded and the previous netkit-telnet got dropped from the archive (Debian & Ubuntu)

 15:45 <slyon> hehe :)

 15:45 <eslerm> sorry David :pray:

 15:45 <slyon> okay. moving on.

 15:45 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 15:46 <eslerm> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/blob/75a487a44c91728e6c35338ed78b57f978bfeea6/README.md?plain=1#L159

 15:46 <joalif> nothing

 15:46 <slyon> I approved bug #2003549 today after all the required TODOs got resolved, cc athos

 15:46 <sarnold> I added a comment and subscriptions on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ipmitool/+bug/1978144

 15:46 <eslerm> I'd like to change the MIR process to require one LP bug # per MIR request

 15:47 <eslerm> when multiple MIRs are on a single LP page, it breaks security tooling and is generally confusing

 15:47 <sarnold> I think that's a good idea; I'd love to see us move to something like the kernel team's tracking bugs

 15:47 <eslerm> I can make a PR to describe this, but wanted to highlight the issue here

 15:47 <sarnold> the downside of course is that it'd require new tooling to make a change that drastic

 15:48 <slyon> eslerm: no objections against this from my side... it's sometimes easier/quicker to have multiple (small) packages on the same LP bug (like all those *-perl deps), but having individual bugs is the cleaner approach

 15:48 <sarnold> this change is nice and small, addresses problems we're having with jira right now, and doesn't require tooling changes

 15:48 <slyon> eslerm: do you mind creating a PR on github to update that part of the section and we can have the discussion in the PR review?

 15:48 <eslerm> can do

 15:48 <eslerm> thank you

 15:48 <sarnold> it is more work for bug filers :/ but I think the clarity gain is worth it

 15:49 <slyon> thanks eslerm! Then we should be able to find consensus on the next MIR meeting

 15:49 <sarnold> (or, at least, I'm assuming I'm not the only one who has trouble figuring out which of N packages is referred to when reading comments within an omnibus bug)

 15:49 <eslerm> \o/

 15:50 <dviererbe> I asked cpaelzer to enable the Issues section. I promised to respond to issues and redirect them here if the authors doesn't do it. I have PR adding a Contributing section to the Readme: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/13

 15:50 <didrocks> I don’t have strong opinions from my side, so the easiest for you is fine by me :)

 15:51 <eslerm> ^ reads well to me

 15:51 <sarnold> dviererbe: I like it

 15:51 <slyon> dviererbe: I also like it.

 15:51 <dviererbe> Thank you :)

 15:52 <joalif> thanks slyon, all :)

 15:52 <slyon> Could everybody please add their review (+1/-1) on the pending PRs: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:52 <slyon> so we can get those landed soon?

 15:52 <sarnold> slyon: heh, we should add that as a recurring section in the meeting agenda

 15:52 <slyon> sarnold: ACK. I'll create a PR to update the meeting script :)

 15:52 <sarnold> \o/

 15:53 <slyon> I guess that's all for today.

 15:53 <slyon> thanks folks!

 15:53 <eslerm> thanks slyon, all o/

 15:53 <sarnold> thanks slyon, all :)
