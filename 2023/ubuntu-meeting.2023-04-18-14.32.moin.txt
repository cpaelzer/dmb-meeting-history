 14:32 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 14:32 <cpaelzer> hopefully we are living the release week dream of having nothing to assign today :-)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> jaraco is known and on openstack (jamespage)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> nothing else ion mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> nothing else that isn't a false positive

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:33 <cpaelzer> empty

 14:34 <slyon> looks like jaraco didn't make it this cycle, and the python-autocommand dependency got demoted back to universe for Lunar

 14:34 <cpaelzer> (so far my plan works)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> yep slyon

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I mean, that was to be expected since no one doubled down on it

 14:34 <slyon> yes

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:35 <cpaelzer> no updates since 11th April (last weeks meeting)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> we have assigned a few last week, so let us see if they are in the security queue already

 14:35 <cpaelzer> but first

 14:35 <cpaelzer> PRs/issues to the process

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:35 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:35 <cpaelzer> 2x none

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:35 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:35 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:35 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:36 <sarnold> I don't believe we've made progress on any of these items this week, our resources have been focused on other priorities

 14:36 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:36 <cpaelzer> that is - for once - ok sarnold

 14:37 <sarnold> for now, heh :)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> as no one has expected those cases to make it into 23.04 anyway

 14:37 <slyon> ACK

 14:37 <cpaelzer> slyon: last weeks mentioning of heif made me check the state of HDR support

 14:37 <cpaelzer> do not check it yourself, sad story

 14:37 <sarnold> heh :(

 14:37 <cpaelzer> might be a while until I can buy new screens

 14:37 <cpaelzer> so this might be the release week meeting we all hoped for

 14:38 <cpaelzer> quick, effective, nothing to do

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:38 <slyon> cpaelzer: okay... let me put that on Foundations' internal roadmap plan for libheif

 14:38 <sarnold> I do have a hopefully quick question

 14:38 <sarnold> re jaraco et al

 14:38 <cpaelzer> sarnold: go

 14:38 <sarnold> are those in lunar-proposed or are they in devel-proposed?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> slyon: it is the desktop that needs to be able to display, even once you have the lib

 14:38 <slyon> cpaelzer: understood

 14:38 <cpaelzer> slyon: but having the lib and diplsaing normal-dr is better than not displaying it at all

 14:39 <sarnold> or, what keeps those from "promoting to main" via usual -proposed seven day aging thing?

 14:39 <slyon> right

 14:39 <sarnold> .. post release

 14:39 <cpaelzer> sarnold: the component mismatch holds them back

 14:39 <sarnold> cpaelzer: yay

 14:39 <cpaelzer> that is always a barrier to pass even on SRUs

 14:40 <cpaelzer> and furthermore the release team usually clears remaining proposed IIRFC

 14:40 <cpaelzer> IIRC

 14:40 <cpaelzer> they either go in, or they go away

 14:40 <slyon> sarnold: also I think they are in "devel-proposed" (which doesn't really exist).. basically will be moved to "mm-proposed" once that exists

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I've never seen a release go out with things in proposed not meant to be zero-day SRUs

 14:40 <cpaelzer> this is release team magic which I haven't been part of

 14:40 <sarnold> *nod* same here, always on the edges :)

 14:41 <cpaelzer> but we never had to care about cases like this because they are doing great

 14:41 <sarnold> *nod*

 14:41 <sarnold> and sometimes I get to wondering how those things get enforced :)

 14:41 <sarnold> thanks for the reassurance :)

 14:41 <cpaelzer> yw

 14:41 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:41 <sarnold> are we skipping next week's?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> some of us I guess, but I do not know how to announce

 14:42 <cpaelzer> so I'd say, those who can join

 14:42 <cpaelzer> and see if there is anything

 14:42 <cpaelzer> and will quickly be over

 14:42 <didrocks> hopefully as quickly as this one :)

 14:42 <cpaelzer> for anyone external - the majority of people will be on a sprint next and even more in the week after

 14:42 <cpaelzer> hence expect low participation here

 14:42 <cpaelzer> good

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I'd call this done for now then

 14:42 <cpaelzer> any last words?

 14:43 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 14:43 <slyon> thanks, all!

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thank you all!

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
