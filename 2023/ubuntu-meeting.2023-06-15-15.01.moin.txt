 15:02 <juliank> Let's take our usual minutes to read this

 15:02 <juliank> (and/or finish writing)

 15:11 <bdmurray> I have no questions

 15:11 <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:11 <juliank> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <juliank> tagged foundations-todo, moving on

 15:14 <juliank> ll is empty

 15:14 <juliank> https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <juliank> bug 2023545

 15:14 <schopin> That sounds... unfortunate.

 15:15 <juliank> I thought we had a JIRA for this already?

 15:16 <schopin> I wanted to look at it a bit more before tagging foundations-todo, but stuff kept coming up :/

 15:16 <juliank> ah right we talked about it in the meeting only

 15:16 <juliank> (system squad meeting)

 15:17 <schopin> If we tag this, adrien, would you have the bandwidth to carry it forward?

 15:17 <adrien> well, I've never touched ibmca, which is my main concern for testing

 15:18 <schopin> Presumably there's no need to touch it, just install it :)

 15:18 <adrien> I don't even know what it is! :P

 15:18 <juliank> you need the hardware for it presumably

 15:19 <vorlon> maybe get Frank to do the testing?

 15:22 <juliank> tagged

 15:22 <juliank> so ff is empty

 15:22 <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:22 <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <juliank> vorlon: huge perl migration huh?

 15:22 <vorlon> is there?

 15:23 <juliank> more like perl related packages

 15:23 <vorlon> doesn't look so big :)

 15:23 <vorlon> anyway there's only two packages wanting attention, the rest are new

 15:23 <vorlon> fwupd still outstanding, but now only failing on s390x; liushuyu is this still yours?

 15:24 <liushuyu> vorlon: still mine. I was busy with the armhf stuff this week

 15:24 <vorlon> ok

 15:24 <vorlon> and ubuntu-release-upgrader is waiting for i386 test results that will never manifest because it's denylisted

 15:24 <vorlon> so I'll follow up on that

 15:24 <vorlon> that's all this week

 15:24 <juliank> #topic AOB

 15:25 <vorlon> next Monday is a holiday for the US

 15:26 <zhsj> i'll have 2 holiday next week

 15:27 <juliank> #endmeeting
