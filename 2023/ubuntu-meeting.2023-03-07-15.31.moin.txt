 15:32 <cpaelzer> no update on ndctl from my side

 15:32 <joalif> o/

 15:32 <didrocks> hey

 15:32 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: IIRC the dice picked you, did you look into that already?

 15:32 <slyon> devscripts should eventually drop its new dependencies: https://salsa.debian.org/debian/devscripts/-/merge_requests/336

 15:32 * jamespage sends apologies - can't make today (about to disappear)

 15:32 <cpaelzer> yep slyon, thanks I've seent hat update

 15:32 <cpaelzer> I was feeling bad when handing out to NACKs

 15:33 <cpaelzer> but it seems you received it well

 15:33 <cpaelzer> ok jamespage, thanks for letting us know

 15:33 <slyon> yes, I think that was the correct decision. Let's see what Debian thinks about it. For now I'll not pull it into the Ubuntu delta, but wait for a decision in Debian, as this is not critical and could be postponed into nextx cycle

 15:33 <cpaelzer> jamespage: before you are not even logging - jaraco.text -> python-inflect

 15:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: that seemed ready if I read it correctly

 15:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: but a subscription of the team was needed

 15:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: once that is done it seems ready (just had a glimpse)

 15:34 <jamespage> cpaelzer: I'll sort that out

 15:34 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:34 <slyon> inetutils[-telnet] is currently being prepared by dviererbe

 15:34 <cpaelzer> ok, the feature freeze works

 15:35 <cpaelzer> there is less noise in here

 15:35 <cpaelzer> and thanks for telnet dviererbe

 15:35 <cpaelzer> after sarnold has survived the blast from the past :-P

 15:35 <cpaelzer> next section I guess

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:35 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:36 <cpaelzer> new cas elooking for an owner

 15:36 <sarnold> good morning

 15:36 <didrocks> I can do it starting next week (probably Monday)

 15:36 <cpaelzer> that looks for a reviewer, but I'm sadly 250% drowned in tasks atm

 15:36 <cpaelzer> anyone else?

 15:36 <cpaelzer> oh thanks didrocks

 15:36 <slyon> I could.. but I do have short weeks this week and next

 15:37 <didrocks> grumph

 15:37 <didrocks> "- We will provide a manual testplan to cover the behaviour changes and features added by the extension"

 15:37 <didrocks> really, we should prevent people filing MIR if they don’t fulfill already all the requirements

 15:37 <cpaelzer> this is not your team, but your department

 15:37 <cpaelzer> you should speak to them

 15:37 <didrocks> did multiple times already

 15:37 <didrocks> and asked to not subscribe that one before it’s ready :/

 15:38 <didrocks> I think we should be stricter in the criteria and not start reviewing before the MIR is ready

 15:38 <didrocks> maybe this way, the message will be clear

 15:38 <didrocks> (I don’t mind when it happens one time, I do mind when it’s regular)

 15:38 <sarnold> at least in this case you can make it clear that's a condition to starting in on it next week

 15:39 <didrocks> wait, maybe it’s just the description not being updated

 15:39 <didrocks> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell-extension-tiling-assistant/+bug/2007710/comments/1

 15:40 <cpaelzer> [Quality assurance - testing] has the details that were added

 15:40 <didrocks> yeah, it’s in plain text below in the description

 15:40 <didrocks> I’ll ask it to be on a wiki page

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ack didrocks

 15:40 <cpaelzer> one more thing, when you ask

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I (personally) haven't yet seen/heard of the other cases which ended up with manual plans being executed. Getting an example/evidence of that would be a great confidence boost as well.

 15:41 <cpaelzer> so when you ask, you might ask about that as well

 15:41 <didrocks> will do!

 15:41 <cpaelzer> thank you

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:41 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:41 <cpaelzer> top down

 15:41 <cpaelzer> autocommand is what I asked jamespage to fix the team subscription

 15:41 <cpaelzer> lib*perl is the devscripts case that will be fixed in Debian

 15:41 <jamespage> done

 15:41 <jamespage> (not here)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage that isn't here

 15:42 <sarnold> :)

 15:42 <slyon> I wonder if we should subscribe ~ubuntu-openstack to the (incomplete) python-inflect task in that MIR?

 15:42 <cpaelzer> jamespage: on src:python-inflect there are more todo's left, assign to coreycb or someone else (who might be here)

 15:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: I thought about the very same

 15:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: doing so

 15:43 <jamespage> done

 15:43 <jamespage> (~still not here)

 15:43 <slyon> IIRC python-inflect wasn't in good shape and needs quite some work

 15:43 <cpaelzer> inetutils was clarified and has dviererbe working on it

 15:43 <slyon> ack

 15:43 <cpaelzer> log4cplus , hmm

 15:44 <cpaelzer> actually waiting for an FFE

 15:44 <cpaelzer> I have asked athos to ping for that since there was no response yet

 15:44 <cpaelzer> the rest is older than a week

 15:44 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:44 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:44 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 15:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:44 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 15:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:45 <cpaelzer> sarnold: you said you are on kea, any progress? it is still lsited as todo in jira

 15:45 <cpaelzer> eslerm: how is pcs looking so far good/bad/ugly?

 15:45 <sarnold> cpaelzer: kea is still in todo -- I'm not yet finished with duktape, and 360s will consume much time in the next week

 15:45 <eslerm> puma is finished, working on pcs now. It's a large package, but *soon*

 15:45 <cpaelzer> thanks eslerm

 15:46 <eslerm> I believe pcs will be ack'd. code is very clean and maintained well. there's just a lot to review properly

 15:46 <cpaelzer> understandable

 15:46 <cpaelzer> ok sarnold, just print out an image of me and add a speech bubble asking "kea?" and tuck it to your screen :-)

 15:46 <sarnold> cpaelzer: lol love it :)

 15:47 <cpaelzer> BTW no one here can complain about 360s unless you have as many people to review as I do (or if I complain, then just chime in)

 15:47 <cpaelzer> and yes, duktape still seing active is nice

 15:47 <didrocks> good luck with those :)

 15:47 <cpaelzer> jbicha: you mentioned policykit-122 might not happen for 23.04

 15:47 <cpaelzer> jbicha: should we abort/postpone the duktape review?

 15:47 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I do like the opportunity to tell my coworkers they're awesome :) but it does take time to do well

 15:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ok, that counts as "not complaining" - do it!

 15:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: about duktape, did you hear anything in that regard?

 15:48 <cpaelzer> or was it only pulled from lunar-proposed to let things migrate but will come back in time for 3.04?

 15:48 <cpaelzer> 23.04

 15:49 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I had some concerns about memory allocation patterns in it and sent upstream a few questions, and got back an amazing response. I'm strongly encouraged that upstream knows what they're doing and would be easy to work with.

 15:49 <sarnold> cpaelzer: oh, in that regard, nothing at all

 15:49 <cpaelzer> hmm

 15:49 <cpaelzer> I pinged jbicha in #desktop this morning and there is no reply yet since policikit-122 is also in https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-notes/31910 but not more in lunar

 15:49 <cpaelzer> not sure who else to ping

 15:50 <cpaelzer> ok, for this meeting let us go on

 15:50 <cpaelzer> people might read highlights/logs later

 15:50 <didrocks> I can ask about it if you want, I just need to update myself on the matter first

 15:50 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:50 <didrocks> nothing from me

 15:50 <joalif> nothing

 15:50 <slyon> didrocks: did you already have some capacity to look into https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libstring-license-perl/+bug/2003083

 15:50 <slyon> (I just updated the description, to make clear the MIR is actually filed in comment #4)

 15:50 <didrocks> slyon: nope, as said when I took it "next pulse" :)

 15:50 <cpaelzer> nothing further here either

 15:50 <slyon> didrocks: ACK. thanks

 15:51 <didrocks> but it’s on my list, don’t worry

 15:51 <sarnold> a reminder to use your pto days before the end of march if you haven't; and a reminder to finish the compliance training; and a reminder to plan for 360s ;)

 15:51 <sarnold> that's it for me, hehe

 15:51 <slyon> sorry i was kind of distracted last meeting :)

 15:51 <slyon> nothing else from my side

 15:51 <cpaelzer> sarnold: so unfair

 15:52 <cpaelzer> sarnold: that keeps you busy 24/7 already :-P

 15:52 <slyon> haha

 15:52 <sarnold> cpaelzer: it feels it sometimes, yes

 15:52 <cpaelzer> my lonely picture will be wasted if you take your deserved PTO

 15:52 <slyon> don't forgett the hiring/interviews in between :)

 15:52 <cpaelzer> anyway, call this done :-)

 15:52 <sarnold> oh yes :)

 15:52 <sarnold> maybe an addendum then: cook your meals and walk your walks

 15:52 <cpaelzer> ok, give back all of us 8 minutes to fight the busy days we have

 15:52 <sarnold> \o/

 15:52 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 15:52 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
