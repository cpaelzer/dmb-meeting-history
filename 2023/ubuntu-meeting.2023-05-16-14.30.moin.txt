 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> nothing new in non-proposed

 14:32 <cpaelzer> hmm

 14:32 <slyon> geoip looks new

 14:32 <slyon> is the server team tracking that?

 14:32 <cpaelzer> nginx -> geoip sounds familiar

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I think we changed to geoip2 two cycles back

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I'll take care to check what is going on

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I see that openstack started on jaraco

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and then there is transmission

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Desktop package

 14:33 <sarnold> mantic-proposed has a 'drop geoip' in the changelog https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+changelog -- it might solve itself in a few days? :)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> didrocks isn't here today to use his Desktop connections, seb128 isn#t her eeither

 14:34 <cpaelzer> pinging jbicha if there is any known context on transmission

 14:34 <sarnold> * Switch back to gtk4, now that the previous upload migrated.

 14:34 <sarnold> the MIR of gtkmm4.0 is planned.

 14:34 <jbicha> it's still on my todo list to file the MIRs for gtkmm4.0 (& related pkgs)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> ok, we are happy to wait

 14:35 <sarnold> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transmission/+changelog  -- this one looksl ike the tip of the iceberg for new work, heh

 14:35 <cpaelzer> sarnold: on geoip - the changelog has this under dropped changes

 14:35 <cpaelzer> sarnold: "[No longer required due to Debian packaging split]"

 14:35 <sarnold> cpaelzer: oh!

 14:35 <cpaelzer> sarnold: but it seems that didn't fully work, chances are something is now split and meant to migrate to universe

 14:35 <cpaelzer> I'll talk with bryce

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:36 <cpaelzer> that means we are ok with all findings in mismatches today

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:36 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:36 <cpaelzer> one new

 14:36 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcpcd5/+bug/2019191

 14:37 <slyon> this will be the (future) replacement for isc-dhcp-client

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Anyone able to do the review and not having Thu (and probably Fri) off due to public holiday in a lot of central europe?

 14:38 * slyon abstains, due to it being a Foundations package

 14:38 <cpaelzer> yeah, I guess I can take one - but due to said public holiday it will be somewhen next week

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:39 <cpaelzer> some updates on duktape, but not yet ready to be acted on

 14:39 <cpaelzer> nothing else in this list yet

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:40 <cpaelzer> just my re-review topic which we can handle in AOB

 14:40 <cpaelzer> nothing else in those lists

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:40 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:40 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:40 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:40 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: this is the time to make progress on those items not being pressing issues

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: because in a month or two the list will be dominated by "I NEED THIS" items

 14:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold: so how is current velocity on reviews looking?

 14:42 * cpaelzer checks #security channel for distractions of sarnold ...

 14:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, no progress lately; there has been some ongoing work on the tooling to try to improve the tooling. one current hurdle is that our coverity license has expired, and re-signing that contract is stuck somewhere; people are poking and prodding even while on vacation :/

 14:43 <cpaelzer> oh

 14:43 <sarnold> there's enough folks on post-sprint recovery and lss and so on that we're not yet at full force

 14:43 <cpaelzer> so without this license, is review fully blocked ?

 14:43 <cpaelzer> or just "less good"

 14:43 <sarnold> not completely, but it is enough of a hurdle to be obnoxious

 14:43 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks for the FYI

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> as last week - just https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/17

 14:44 <cpaelzer> thanks for your feedback so far

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I know I need to create a good way to find those old bugs

 14:44 <cpaelzer> but other than that everyone seems happy so far

 14:45 <cpaelzer> any other feedback or request for change that didn#t make it into thr github PR?

 14:45 <sarnold> I think I forgot to mention a pal's spell checking action https://www.check-spelling.dev/

 14:45 <sarnold> if we wanted to keep the spelling in good order, this might be worth dropping in

 14:46 <sarnold> but if we make so few changes and spelling doesn't *really* matter, it's just nice to have, it might not be worth the ongoing cost

 14:46 <cpaelzer> is that free to activate without pain?

 14:46 <dviererbe> *creating a bookmark*

 14:46 <sarnold> I think so, but I'm not actually well-versed in github actions; I think it's 'just' a matter of cloning the repo, dropping a .github/ directory thingy in place, pushing it, and letting the bot do the rest

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I'll have a look

 14:47 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:47 <dviererbe> I can investigate this. I have some experience with github actions

 14:47 <slyon> here's a template: https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this

 14:48 <cpaelzer> thanks dviererbe for the volunteering

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I guess you can fork and experiment there, and once you know how open a PR and/or contact me to get things done in the main repo?

 14:49 <dviererbe> I'll do that

 14:49 <sarnold> woot, thanks :)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> I'll take the todo that slyon gave me to add the "old MIR bug" query

 14:49 <cpaelzer> and thereby, the agenda of today is at the end

 14:49 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:49 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:49 <sarnold> except a gigantic curiosity how that 'old mir bug' query will work

 14:50 <slyon> nothing, thanks!

 14:50 <cpaelzer> sarnold: magic :-)

 14:50 <sarnold> I don't have a clue how I'd even start tackling it, if it were my todo :)

 14:50 <sarnold> :D

 14:50 <slyon> (it's not just "old MIR bug", there might be packages without any bug

 14:50 <sarnold> probably about a thousand of them..

 14:50 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:50 <cpaelzer> the API isn't too bad

 14:50 <cpaelzer> of LP I mean

 14:51 <sarnold> I wasn't there, but my guess is the starting point was "what's installed on every one of elmo's computers" :)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> It is most likely not a query, but a python program

 14:51 <cpaelzer> sarnold: that might have been true :-)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> but for today, let us close the meeting here

 14:51 <cpaelzer> have fun everyone!

 14:51 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all; enjoy the long weekens, those who have them :)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
