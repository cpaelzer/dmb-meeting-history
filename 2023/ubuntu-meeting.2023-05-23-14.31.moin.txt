 14:31 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )

 14:31 <cpaelzer> we already got a few "hello" before the meeting (and thereby the log) started

 14:31 <cpaelzer> hi everyone

 14:31 <didrocks> hey

 14:31 <slyon> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mantic is rather active now, let us get this started

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <joalif> o/

 14:32 <cpaelzer> wow

 14:32 <sarnold> lol love all the arrows on nvidia*

 14:32 <cpaelzer> nvidia-graphics-drivers-530 looks funny

 14:32 <cpaelzer> but no work for us there

 14:32 <cpaelzer> transmission still has stubs

 14:32 <cpaelzer> nothing to act yet on that

 14:32 <cpaelzer> jaraco is going on still

 14:33 <cpaelzer> the rest are known false-positives IIRC

 14:33 <didrocks> sounds about right

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:33 <cpaelzer> one new https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmysofa/+bug/2019951

 14:34 <cpaelzer> weird name, but reasonable use

 14:34 <cpaelzer> spatial audio

 14:34 <cpaelzer> looking for a reviewer

 14:34 <didrocks> I’m happy to get it in our next pulse

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I'm still on dhcpcd from last week, that is a bit bigger than I assumed

 14:34 <cpaelzer> next pulse means starting monday didrocks?

 14:34 <didrocks> the 05 June

 14:34 <cpaelzer> that should still be ok

 14:34 <cpaelzer> thanks for volunteering

 14:34 <didrocks> I think so

 14:35 <cpaelzer> I'm sure you'll have your fun criticizing missing tests

 14:35 <didrocks> (with the amount of specs I’m writing, the current pulse is already too booked to be completed)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> understandable

 14:35 <didrocks> I’m sure seb128 is already waiting for it :)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> he now sees a name who to ping if needed

 14:35 <cpaelzer> wow

 14:36 <cpaelzer> so many recent updates

 14:36 <sarnold> hello new gtk?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> indeed

 14:36 <cpaelzer> but yet incomplete

 14:36 <cpaelzer> let us wait until they get all the ducks in a row

 14:36 <didrocks> agreed

 14:36 <cpaelzer> probably up for reivew in a while

 14:36 <sarnold> ... good thing they have duktape :)

 14:37 <didrocks> too many "mm" in the names, not really looking forward to doing c++ :p

 14:37 <cpaelzer> the one without mm has c++ in the name :-P

 14:37 <sarnold> lol

 14:37 <cpaelzer> anyway, ok for today

 14:37 <cpaelzer> but kind of a heads up what is coming

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:38 <eslerm> (I like that this is an official topic now)

 14:38 <dviererbe> me too :)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> indeed

 14:39 <dviererbe> ci: add automated spell checking

 14:39 <dviererbe> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/19

 14:39 <cpaelzer> the PR on the MIR process still waits on me to create a tool to query

 14:39 <cpaelzer> that will take a while

 14:39 <cpaelzer> but the contribs of dviererbe are ready IMHO

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I looked at them before

 14:39 <cpaelzer> have a look at his link

 14:39 <cpaelzer> and also at https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/18 which is the direct result

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I really like that and would merge, it it fails we can undo it - but it LGTM

 14:40 <eslerm> maybe squash, but I'm agnostic

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I'd keep them as is

 14:40 <didrocks> yeah, it look all good :) (I like separate commits though)

 14:40 <cpaelzer> commits are not costly here

 14:40 <eslerm> +2

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we haven't reached the projetc size to need squashing or submaintainers :-)

 14:41 <slyon> +1 for merging #18

 14:41 <slyon> I added small comments to #19

 14:41 <cpaelzer> slyon: demonstrates that one can find things if you actually read every word - thanks

 14:41 <cpaelzer> dviererbe: will you fix up #19 and then ping me?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I think we are ok to land once those are good

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #18 seems ready now, those are just good fixes

 14:42 <dviererbe> Yes, will do

 14:42 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:42 <dviererbe> Please wait for #18

 14:42 <dviererbe> I think sylon has found another typo

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I'm on hold until you let me know

 14:42 <eslerm> nifty @check-spelling-bot Report

 14:42 <cpaelzer> does not neet to be live in this meeting

 14:42 <didrocks> I think in the long term we should factor this in a separate repo, as a github reusable workflow

 14:43 <dviererbe> Okay :)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> didrocks: you are right, but for now let us keep it simple

 14:43 <cpaelzer> didrocks: that allows this and a few others to evolve until we could see what would be a good general checker for canonical

 14:44 <didrocks> agreed

 14:44 <didrocks> happy to help once it matures enough

 14:44 <eslerm> do the "forbidden patterns" need to be cleaned up from the check spelling report?

 14:45 <slyon> I think we should put all questions/suggestions into the PR itself, so dviererbe can work on it after the meeting

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ack

 14:45 <eslerm> sounds good

 14:45 <dviererbe> ack

 14:45 <cpaelzer> good on that topic it seems

 14:45 <cpaelzer> let us go on

 14:45 <cpaelzer> thanks already for the contrib dviererbe

 14:46 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/19

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:46 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:46 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:46 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:46 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:47 <eslerm> we are ramping mir assignment backup on the security team after the sprint/lunar

 14:47 <cpaelzer> we have none and won't add much these cycle, maybe one or two

 14:47 <eslerm> rust is a large priority

 14:47 <seb128> the first url is buggy (at least in my IRC client)

 14:47 <seb128> the %5B/%5D confuse the query

 14:47 <sarnold> we've had little progress since last week; we have assigned some of the holdovers from last cycle, but yesterday, so unlikely anyone's made progress on anything. last I knew our coverity license hadn't been sorted yet.

 14:48 <slyon> eslerm: I'm glad to hear that! :) (wrt rust)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> seb128: I click and it works - it is  is [ 5D is ]

 14:48 <sarnold> seb128, does it cope with lowercase better? https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5bMIR%5d&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:48 <cpaelzer> the problem is that unescaped even mire clients and tools would fail

 14:48 <seb128> no, but don't worry about it, perhaps an issue with hexchat on my end...

 14:49 <cpaelzer> for me upper and lower works - IIRC the escaping is supposed to use upper case right?

 14:49 <cpaelzer> seb128: your browser should understand

 14:49 <sarnold> I'm shocked to say that I have no idea :D

 14:49 <seb128> I end up with a launchpad page with '%5bMIR%5d' as text which has no match

 14:49 <sarnold> sounds like a busted security fix *cough*

 14:49 <seb128> anyway don't let me derail the meeting

 14:49 <cpaelzer> sarnold: does https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=[MIR]&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir work for you?

 14:50 <seb128> that one wfm

 14:50 <cpaelzer> hmm

 14:50 <sarnold> cpaelzer: wfm in firefox

 14:50 <cpaelzer> so proper escaping fails on some clients

 14:50 <cpaelzer> but no escaping works

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I'll update the templat to just throw both links

 14:50 <slyon> clients being smart about doing the escaping themselves..

 14:50 <cpaelzer> so each combination of the chatclient/browser populations will have one that works

 14:51 <sarnold> lol

 14:51 <sarnold> nice solution :)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> escape the escaping - meta issues FTW

 14:51 <slyon> xD

 14:52 <sarnold> hey iosifache :)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> fixed

 14:52 <eslerm> o/

 14:52 <iosifache> Hey!

 14:53 <cpaelzer> ok, the actual topic is good

 14:53 <cpaelzer> the meta issue on it is fixed

 14:53 <cpaelzer> going on

 14:53 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:53 <sarnold> none from me

 14:53 <cpaelzer> I'll be out for the next two weeks, would you mind as usual to self organize and someone lead the meeting then?

 14:53 <didrocks> nothing either

 14:54 <slyon> I'll be out for the next 2-3 weeks for personal reasons :)

 14:54 <cpaelzer> I know :-)

 14:54 <seb128> I need input from the MIR team on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538

 14:54 <slyon> seb128: looking.

 14:54 <cpaelzer> seb128: should we just read the comments?

 14:54 <cpaelzer> or is there a more specific question

 14:54 <seb128> it was acked by slyon but I found that demoting dbus-daemon might not be as easy as expected

 14:54 <seb128> see current comment

 14:55 <seb128> I wonder if keeping an utility binary from dbus-daemon in main would be acceptable

 14:55 <seb128> if we demote the actual service

 14:56 <slyon> IMO the suggested solution is OK (as long as we're not doing it in an LTS, so Mantic is fine), but I'd leave the final call about that to the security team. As long as the plan is still in place to get it fully resolved by the next LTS

 14:57 <sarnold> this issue was opened in 2018 :(

 14:57 <cpaelzer> ack to slyon, but I have one extra constraint to add

 14:58 <cpaelzer> In the past we had such agreements, but by the fact that the team owning - in this case dbus - is foundations and security, but not Desktop we had the problem that the motivation to resolve this wasn't present in the same team

 14:58 <cpaelzer> due to that things dragged on a while

 14:58 <cpaelzer> would you be ok to take dbus >=mantic

 14:58 <cpaelzer> then you'd be the one benefitting from the situation being resolved

 14:59 <cpaelzer> BTW - former cases were not your team

 14:59 <seb128> hum, I'm not sure I can commit at this point to us rewritting dbus-run-session for the LTS

 14:59 <cpaelzer> so I'm purely referring to lessons learned

 14:59 <seb128> I guess plan B is to give up on that switch

 15:00 <seb128> desktop was not the driver for that switch, though we picked it up and have interested

 15:00 <cpaelzer> I see

 15:00 <slyon> It got dropped by foundations in the past due to lack of capacity

 15:00 <cpaelzer> it would be a shame to fully give it up, but we are somewhat between a rock and a hard place

 15:00 <seb128> I can try to make a case to squeeze that work next cycle but I've no visiblity at this point on how realistic that is for us

 15:00 <sarnold> how did fedora deal with the switch?

 15:01 <seb128> they keep installing dbus-tools from dbus-daemon

 15:01 <seb128> they don't bother about 'demoting' things as much as we do

 15:01 <sarnold> aha

 15:02 <cpaelzer> hmm

 15:02 <cpaelzer> how about changing the order of things

 15:02 <cpaelzer> work on rewriting first

 15:02 <cpaelzer> if it works in time for the LTS, let us switch

 15:02 <seb128> that basically means giving up on the switch for the LTS

 15:03 <cpaelzer> is it?

 15:03 <seb128> the one person in our team with the skills to do that work is already overworked over capacity this cycle

 15:03 <seb128> and we will no switch a base foundation component in the LTS cycle

 15:03 <seb128> not

 15:03 <cpaelzer> indeed, that is something we'd generall want before the LTS

 15:04 <cpaelzer> so IMHO it becomes a call for foundations and secuity if it is a problem that they will hold on to dbus while dbus-broker is then there as well

 15:04 <slyon> I could check back with mclemenceau_ if there's any capacity in foundation's system squad.. but I think they're fully booked, too.

 15:04 <cpaelzer> if that is ok for those two groups, then the duplication problem isn't that much of a problem

 15:04 <seb128> we would only maintain the utility

 15:04 <cpaelzer> maybe slyon and sarnold can bring that to the team and update the bug once they know

 15:04 <cpaelzer> seb128: yep

 15:05 <seb128> a plan C could be to try to copy that part of the dbus-daemon code in the dbus-broker source...

 15:05 <seb128> but that's just a more complicated way to end up maintaining the same code

 15:05 <cpaelzer> yeah, I'd not like that

 15:05 <sarnold> I did wonder about that, or split the source file out into its own micropackage, but it'd probably drag in some percentage of the dbus-daemon code anyway, then we've got a few versions of it to track :(

 15:05 <seb128> I'm fine with letting it to foundations and security to figure out what they want to do

 15:05 <cpaelzer> the process is meant to help not maintaining the same thing twice - not to make us do awkward twists to trick it

 15:06 <cpaelzer> ok, slyon and sarnold - would you take the task to find out and comment back on the bug

 15:06 <cpaelzer> I guess we all would want dbus-broker, but can not decide if that is ok for you

 15:06 <sarnold> yeah, thanks for raising it nice and early seb128 :)

 15:06 <cpaelzer> thanks seb128for bringing it up

 15:06 <seb128> thanks!

 15:06 <slyon> ack, thanks!

 15:07 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:07 <cpaelzer> it seems we can conclude

 15:07 <cpaelzer> sorry for running over

 15:07 <cpaelzer> anything else to say before we close?

 15:07 <sarnold> enjoy your two weeks off, those who are doing so :)

 15:07 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:08 <cpaelzer> but that is easy, enjoy the weeks working - because that is when things are great

 15:08 <cpaelzer> closing the meting then

 15:08 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:08 <eslerm> bye all o/
