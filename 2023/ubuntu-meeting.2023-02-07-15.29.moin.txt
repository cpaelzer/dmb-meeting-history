 15:29 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:29 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:29:34 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:29 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:30 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage

 15:30 <cpaelzer> hello to all of you

 15:30 <eslerm> hello o/

 15:30 <cpaelzer> hi eslerm

 15:30 <cpaelzer> you said you want to be here all the time right?

 15:30 <cpaelzer> I might add you to be pinged as well

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <eslerm> I was asked to make *a* commit to the git, and I didn't realize it was for the ping until after making a few commits (:

 15:31 <slyon> o/

 15:31 <sarnold> cpaelzer: cpaelzer https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/8

 15:32 <cpaelzer> merged

 15:32 <sarnold> :D

 15:32 <cpaelzer> ok getting started

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> non-proposed has two new entries

 15:33 <cpaelzer> pipewire->pipewire-media-session but that seems already approved in the past

 15:33 <cpaelzer> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1952924

 15:33 <slyon> (and one false-positive got resolved for good! -- tk8.6)

 15:33 <sarnold> \o/

 15:33 <cpaelzer> gz slyon

 15:33 <cpaelzer> on pipewire, did that just auto-demote and now is needed again?

 15:34 <cpaelzer> it was universe in kinetic

 15:34 <cpaelzer> I'll ping seb128 on the bug how Desktop wants to continue

 15:34 <cpaelzer> just promoting it might not be what they want

 15:34 <slyon> I need to check libsub-quote-perl...

 15:34 <didrocks> (sorry, still in meeting in paralell, but around)

 15:34 <sarnold> hey didrocks :) https://launchpad.net/bugs/1952924

 15:34 <jbicha> cpaelzer: I'm looking into the pipewire-media-session issue. We do not want it in main

 15:35 <cpaelzer> hi jbicha

 15:35 <cpaelzer> ok, reassigned in that case

 15:35 <cpaelzer> once resolved just update the bug with a hint what the final outcome was

 15:36 <cpaelzer> next seems to be another perl case for slyon

 15:36 <cpaelzer> libsub-quote-perl -> libxstring-perl

 15:36 <cpaelzer> is that known/expected ?

 15:36 <slyon> I didn't have time to check yet.

 15:36 <slyon> the update came from Debian

 15:36 <cpaelzer> can we leave it with you - it isn't urgent, I just need a name that will look after it

 15:36 <slyon> not sure how/why it migrated to -release..

 15:36 <slyon> sure I will take care of it

 15:36 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:37 <cpaelzer> in -proposed we have the same two

 15:37 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:37 <cpaelzer> than jaraco.text -> python.inflect which is openstack (but incomplete)

 15:37 <slyon> I'll also look after devscripts and flashrom

 15:37 <cpaelzer> really new seems to be devscripts

 15:37 <cpaelzer> ok slyon on that

 15:37 <cpaelzer> it seems to be the curse of the foundation member in the MIR team (formerly doko) to get all of these

 15:37 <cpaelzer> but gladly they are usually quick

 15:38 <cpaelzer> then more printing cases

 15:38 <cpaelzer> which we assigned last week

 15:38 <cpaelzer> flashrom was taken by slyon

 15:38 <cpaelzer> duktape is incomplete and that is it for now

 15:38 <cpaelzer> and finally another openstack csae with ceilometer - waiting on input there

 15:38 <cpaelzer> TL;DR - a lot, but nothing that was missed or failing to get attention

 15:39 <cpaelzer> duktape has been going on so long

 15:39 <cpaelzer> what is the latest status on that actually ... ?

 15:39 <sarnold> the python-xmltodict package is currently going through security review, it's looking iffy

 15:39 <cpaelzer> :-/

 15:40 <cpaelzer> duktape needs to be "new" and is already in security queue

 15:40 <cpaelzer> I updated the state

 15:40 <cpaelzer> forgot to set it back from incomplete

 15:40 <cpaelzer> when the discussion calrified that it is needed despite being a duplicate

 15:40 <cpaelzer> no one likes to maintain mozjs it seems :-)

 15:40 <sarnold> heh, yeah

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ok, let us check how many of those are new

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:40 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:41 <cpaelzer> 8 new cases

 15:41 <cpaelzer> so expect that each has to take a few

 15:41 <slyon> those are plenty of new foundations MIRs (related to libheif) – not super high priority

 15:41 <slyon> I could take puma or ruby-nio4r as the only non-foundations cases

 15:41 <cpaelzer> puma and nio4r are a replacement for thin/event in the pcs stack

 15:41 <cpaelzer> they are urgent

 15:41 <cpaelzer> ok slyon assigning you there

 15:42 <didrocks> I still have 3 for printing stack that are in charge, but I only have slots for 2 every pulse now

 15:42 <didrocks> so, I can take them, will probably not be done before FF

 15:42 <cpaelzer> ok, stick to those you already have then

 15:42 <didrocks> (now, we are tracking the MIR work in pusles)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> curse of too fine tracking

 15:42 <didrocks> pulses*

 15:42 <cpaelzer> I'll take the two that have 265 in the name

 15:42 <cpaelzer> just to take two each

 15:42 <didrocks> I’m fine to take some if they are due to post-FF

 15:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: you said "not urgent" what timing are we talking about?

 15:43 <didrocks> because TBH, if they only show up now without warning, not really our team’s fault

 15:43 <cpaelzer> that should be ok didrocks

 15:43 <slyon> we're currently carrying a delta to patch out those dependencies

 15:43 <cpaelzer> and that is why I ask slyon about the timing

 15:43 <slyon> but it would be nice to enable them maybe in 23.10

 15:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: but will it be 23.04 or 23.10 ?

 15:44 <cpaelzer> joalif: jamespage: are you around today?

 15:44 <cpaelzer> I'd have work to distribute :-)

 15:44 <cpaelzer> ok slyon, 23.10 is fine for didrocks to take two then

 15:44 <cpaelzer> didrocks: any preference?

 15:45 <didrocks> no, just assign $whatever

 15:45 <didrocks> happy for you to pick your prefered ones :p

 15:45 <cpaelzer> I've picked the top two for you

 15:45 <cpaelzer> two left

 15:46 <cpaelzer> let us - for fairness assign one each for joalif jamespage - they might be not around and henve get only one instead of two

 15:46 <cpaelzer> please if you read the log later and need to change that - speak up then

 15:46 <cpaelzer> done

 15:47 <cpaelzer> next section then ...

 15:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:48 <cpaelzer> hmm, did you resolve dependencies of dnspython last week?

 15:48 <sarnold> I think the bug said demoted to a suggests?

 15:48 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes, dropped them to suggests

 15:48 <slyon> we don't support DOH for now

 15:48 <slyon> (until somebody needs it)

 15:48 <cpaelzer> yep

 15:48 <cpaelzer> ok can stay as-is then

 15:49 <slyon> ack

 15:49 <slyon> python-typing-extensions should probably be "In Progress", didrocks?

 15:49 <slyon> you state that danilo shall pull in the dependency once migrated

 15:50 <cpaelzer> there are a few more fails it seems

 15:50 <cpaelzer> but yes

 15:51 <cpaelzer> incomplete as the version is broken and stuck

 15:51 <cpaelzer> makes sense

 15:51 <didrocks> right

 15:51 <cpaelzer> can be kept like that

 15:51 <didrocks> incomplete sounds good to me

 15:51 <slyon> ok

 15:51 <cpaelzer> ok done with that

 15:51 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:51 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:51 <cpaelzer> sarnold: and eslerm: thanks for the many bugs that are processed

 15:51 <cpaelzer> I've seen quite a few in my inbox over the last week

 15:52 <cpaelzer> in particular eslerm - thanks for making the eventmachine -> puma suggestion

 15:52 <cpaelzer> that seems to work fine

 15:52 <cpaelzer> process wise, they are now assigned

 15:52 <sarnold> yay! glad to hear that :)

 15:52 <cpaelzer> I'm only unsure if we can get that also updated in exactly that state into lunar in time

 15:52 <cpaelzer> but kanashiro[m] is on it

 15:52 <eslerm> I feel that we are on track to complete pcs MIRs

 15:53 <cpaelzer> slyon:  is quick at review, so once done they will most likely show up in your queue as well

 15:53 <cpaelzer> and those two seem to be the last missing pieces then

 15:53 <cpaelzer> I see more gravatars assigned to reviews

 15:53 <cpaelzer> yeah, really looks ok to me right now

 15:54 <kanashiro[m]> ruby-childprocess is the pcs dep waiting for security review

 15:54 <kanashiro[m]> apart from puma and ruby-nio4r

 15:54 <cpaelzer> is there anything of concern from youtr POV eslerm / sarnold ?

 15:54 <cpaelzer> oh thanks kanashiro[m]

 15:54 <cpaelzer> childprocess is assigned to sarnold already

 15:54 <sarnold> feature freeze always arrives sooner than we expect

 15:54 <cpaelzer> he will surely do it asap - right?

 15:54 <kanashiro[m]> and I'll be updating pcs in lunar soon applying the upstream patch to move to puma

 15:54 <sarnold> but I'm feeling better about it this go around :)

 15:55 <cpaelzer> kanashiro[m]: glad to hear that you think we can make that move already

 15:55 <eslerm> the MIR for pcs itself is currently being worked on as well

 15:55 <cpaelzer> good

 15:55 <cpaelzer> I think it is time for ...

 15:55 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:56 <cpaelzer> not from me, just much to do for anyone that participates - but that is normal I guess

 15:56 <sarnold> eslerm has prepped a few other pull requests

 15:56 <slyon> yeah.. it's a lot this time

 15:57 <sarnold> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:57 <slyon> #5 & #6 lgtm!

 15:57 <sarnold> we're nearing the end of today's slot, but maybe we could / should read them in prep for next week's meeting?

 15:57 <slyon> err #6 & #7 that is

 15:57 <eslerm> thanks for reviews slyon

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I'll review and merge all of them somewhen the next few days

 15:59 <cpaelzer> thank you all!

 15:59 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 15:59 <cpaelzer> on a glimpse they all make sense

 15:59 <cpaelzer> if one could give a +1/-1 tot he one that is from me

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I do not just want to merge my own without any other voice

 15:59 <sarnold> will do

 15:59 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:59 <eslerm> thanks and bye to all o/

 16:00 <cpaelzer> are we complete then - or is there anything else?

 16:00 <sarnold> that's it for me

 16:00 <slyon> I added reviews

 16:00 <slyon> nothing else from my side!

 16:01 <cpaelzer> ok then, have fun you all

 16:01 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
