 15:36 <cpaelzer> nothing totally new in non-proposed

 15:36 <jamespage> o/

 15:36 <cpaelzer> licensecheck -> perl things - didn#t we ahve thta int he past?

 15:37 <slyon> licensecheck is new in -proposed

 15:37 <slyon> seems they've switched build-depends again

 15:37 <cpaelzer> non-yay

 15:37 <slyon> I need to investigate the reasoning

 15:37 <sarnold> cpaelzer: that might have been lintian -> perl things

 15:37 <cpaelzer> slyon: but still that seems like a foundations tackle

 15:37 <slyon> ack

 15:37 <cpaelzer> sarnold: it is a reoccuring pattern for both

 15:37 <cpaelzer> other news here is OVS -> xdp-tools

 15:37 <cpaelzer> fnordahl: has already filed a MIR

 15:37 <sarnold> ack

 15:37 <cpaelzer> I have reviewed it this morning

 15:38 <cpaelzer> it LGTM, but needs security

 15:38 <cpaelzer> so one more for your queue

 15:38 <cpaelzer> jamespage: while we have you here, jaraco.text is on openstack i guess

 15:38 <cpaelzer> and this week i see MIRs linked

 15:38 <cpaelzer> so that processing seems to be started

 15:38 <cpaelzer> *reading*

 15:38 <jamespage> yeah I raised those as corey was busy on some other stuff

 15:39 <cpaelzer> ok so these will look for reviewers in the next section

 15:39 <cpaelzer> nothing else in mismatches AFAICS

 15:39 <jamespage> great

 15:39 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:39 <cpaelzer> duktape (still/again ?)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> and the two python bits for jaraco

 15:39 <cpaelzer> I can do one of the pythons tomorrow morning I guess

 15:40 <cpaelzer> taking autocommand

 15:40 <cpaelzer> what has changed on duktape ... ?

 15:40 <cpaelzer> didrocks: marked it as new

 15:40 <slyon> I can take the other python thingy

 15:40 <cpaelzer> maybe the prep is complete and the decision was they need it

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ok slyon, done

 15:41 <cpaelzer> so this one is still looking for a reviewer https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/duktape/+bug/1997417

 15:41 <didrocks> IMHO, there are some parts that are missing still

 15:41 <didrocks> like no tests

 15:41 <cpaelzer> joalif: didrocks: jamespage: ^^ who could have a look ?

 15:41 <didrocks> (and I don’t think the reporters should skip section or have TODO before filing the MIR)

 15:41 <didrocks> should we start doing an entire review or just mention from the get go "this section is missing, please file it?"

 15:42 <cpaelzer> didrocks: depends on the todo, if it is like "we already know but will do FOO before it is complete" fine, but if it is "this is all bad and we know it, have fun" then no

 15:42 <cpaelzer> didrocks: in incompletely filed MIRs I have in the past done partial reviews just pointing out the obvious

 15:42 <didrocks> I’m telling that because I have the same issue with gnome-sushi, I did the entire review, but there is no tests, it was TODO to write a manual test plan and nothing since it was opened a month ago

 15:42 <cpaelzer> didrocks: and saying they should ping me again once they think it is actually ready

 15:43 <cpaelzer> didrocks: then gnome-sushi goes to incomplete and will starve there until provided

 15:43 <didrocks> right, but I feel that sometimes, we are doing the reporter part compliance check because the reporter hasn’t

 15:43 <cpaelzer> that and similar things do not block the review entirely though

 15:43 <didrocks> like dependencies on universe and so on

 15:43 <cpaelzer> yes, if the reporter seems lazy just ask them to do it

 15:43 <didrocks> so basically, they are relying on the MIR team to do the work

 15:43 <didrocks> ack then

 15:43 <cpaelzer> but if they have done their due diligence and just want the review to know if there is more to resovle -> that seems fine

 15:44 <cpaelzer> I'm ok to make this a case-by-case call

 15:44 <didrocks> I will not shy away for postponing the reviews if some obvious sections are missing then

 15:44 <cpaelzer> as it is hard to formalize a perfect rule for it

 15:44 <didrocks> yeah

 15:44 <cpaelzer> didrocks: yeah, but let them know why you postpone

 15:44 <cpaelzer> so do a bug update to tell them why

 15:44 <cpaelzer> from that moment on, it can be incomplete until provided

 15:44 <didrocks> ack then

 15:45 <cpaelzer> didrocks: would you be able to look at duktape thne?

 15:45 <didrocks> I’ll take ducktape

 15:45 <didrocks> without a c :)

 15:45 <cpaelzer> didrocks: or was this another of the "known incomplete" cases?

 15:45 <didrocks> but is is known incomplete

 15:45 <didrocks> the test section is entirely skipped

 15:45 <cpaelzer> ok, then feel free to point that out OR do a full review which includes pointint ig out - up to you

 15:45 <cpaelzer> s/pointint ig/pointing it/

 15:46 <cpaelzer> thanks, assigned

 15:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:46 <jbicha> yes, bandali hadn't finished preparing the duktape MIR but was planning to this week

 15:46 <cpaelzer> ok jbicha, thanks for the FYI

 15:46 <cpaelzer> we consider it incomplete and not yet assign eit then

 15:46 <cpaelzer> *unassignign didrocks*

 15:47 <cpaelzer> duktape and sishi was discussed already

 15:47 <cpaelzer> the most recent other update is cpdb-libs

 15:47 <cpaelzer> reading ...

 15:47 <cpaelzer> 4 years old for printing ... ?

 15:48 <cpaelzer> ok, just an update about the Debian side of it

 15:49 <cpaelzer> no action (by us) needed as of now

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 15:49 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:49 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 15:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 15:49 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 15:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 15:49 <cpaelzer> as expected the queue grows sarnold

 15:49 <cpaelzer> sarnold: how is the planned increase in workforce to review going?

 15:51 <cpaelzer> on ruby-rack and ruby-sinatra - did you (and eslerm) come to conclusion with Kanashiro how we proceed?

 15:51 <sarnold> cpaelzer: it's going well, mark has been working on several MIRs so far, and sbeattie and aburrage and I had a discussion yesterday; we'll distribute tasks to team members soon, and would like to remind stakeholders to ensure the prioritizations in jira match their needs

 15:51 <cpaelzer> AFAIK the intend was to approve it but require to move to the new major before 24.04 - that would work

 15:51 <cpaelzer> sarnold: to match our need, what would you like most to reflect "has to go in 23.04" ?

 15:52 <cpaelzer> sarnold: flags, deadlines, due dates, comments, ... ?

 15:52 <sarnold> yes; it'd also be nice to have a stronger 'backup plan' idea in place should our strong commitment fade

 15:52 <cpaelzer> The backup plan is complain a lot and then crawl begging for forgiveness at anyone we committed our items to

 15:52 <sarnold> :)

 15:53 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I think the little prioritization chevrons, straight lines, etc, in jira is the way to reflect the priorities

 15:53 <sarnold> though text descriptions of *why* might be very nice

 15:54 <sarnold> something else we discussed yesterday is libssh2, the last MIR didn't go great.. and we were wondering, if cargo-in-main is intended for our building needs, do we *need* remote access stuff in this cargo?

 15:55 <cpaelzer> that is for schopin to answer I guess

 15:55 <sarnold> or, is our cargo packaging expected to be useful outside of our builders? breaking it doesn't seem great, but distro-packaged language-specific tooling always feels like it's missing functionality vs upstream stuff that changes every two or three months

 15:56 <sarnold> it doesn't have to be figured out today :)

 15:56 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:57 <cpaelzer> I've done a few prio updates to reflect the current state

 15:57 <sarnold> we're also looking at moving our meetings around to better match the pulses

 15:57 <cpaelzer> back to hoping you get enough workforce

 15:57 <sarnold> both the internal task distribution meeting and the office hours meeting

 15:57 <schopin> sarnold: we use cargo to do the vendoring, which usually will do some networking stuff.

 15:57 <cpaelzer> one day *dream* those reviews will happen early in the cycle and findings not need to be adressed last minute :-)

 15:57 <sarnold> schopin: ack, makes perfect sense. thanks

 15:57 <cpaelzer> going on then ...

 15:58 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:58 <sarnold> nothing from me

 15:58 <slyon> there's bug #1973033 (and possibly some other hidden, related MIR updates for jammy) – not actionable for us right now. Just a reminder for everybody to resolve/review their assigned, "hidden" Jammy MIRs from last year.

 15:58 <slyon> nothing else from me

 15:58 <cpaelzer> as a heads up for sarnold mostly, alex has been aware since prague - but isc-kea will also enter the 23.04 deadline security review queue soon

 15:58 <cpaelzer> we have been working on tests for a while (to prevent the case didrocks mentioned to be incomplete)

 15:58 <sarnold> cpaelzer: oh nice! is that packaged in debian yet? I thought it was entirely unpackaged :(

 15:58 <cpaelzer> but given the time of the cycle we will enter it to the queue this week

 15:59 <cpaelzer> sarnold: we have updated it for several cycles by now

 15:59 <slyon> sarnold: we'll most probably also have netplan related MIRs for python-rich + dependencies for 23.04 (but not sure if they need sec-review)

 15:59 <cpaelzer> paride in particular

 15:59 <sarnold> aha, very glad to hear it

 15:59 <didrocks> nice!

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I mostly mention so you know for capacity expectations for you sarnold

 15:59 <cpaelzer> ok, time is up

 15:59 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:59 <cpaelzer> !

 15:59 <cpaelzer> rushing to the next meeting ...

 15:59 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)
