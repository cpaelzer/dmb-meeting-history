 20:30 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 20:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:30:47 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:31 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 2nd March 2023. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:31 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:31 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:31 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:31 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:31 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:31 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:31 <diddledani> only one candidate today: Efstathios Iosifidis

 20:32 <iosifidis> Hello.

 20:32 <diddledani> @iosifidis could you introduce yourself to the board and share your links to your discourse or wiki post and your launchpad page (if you have a prepared statement, please deliver it)

 20:32 * genii slides Kilos a surprise coffee and then runs back to work again

 20:32 <nicoz> :) o/*

 20:32 <iosifidis> My name is Stathis. My day job is Veterinarian. I decided to make a career change and now I am a 3rd-year student of applied informatics at the university of Macedonia. My first involvement with open source started with Shipt. My first version was 7.04 but my favorite was Hardy Heron 8.04. Since then I got involved with many events, either

 20:32 <iosifidis> organized by me or as a guest speaker at conferences. I got involved in GNOME community. Greek community hosted GUADEC 2019 in my city.

 20:33 * Kilos smlies and sips, ty so much

 20:33 <iosifidis> I am a very active member of the Loco team. My late involvement with Ubuntu is a promotion at my university to the open source team. I am hosting release parties. I will organize presentations involving Ubuntu technologies. We are planning to create a script and/or an ISO with the software we are using at the university. That is a future project. I

 20:33 <iosifidis> have been to Ubuntu Summit 2022 and I was amazed by the community. I have been to many conferences in the past. I have to say that Summit was the best conference I have been to.

 20:33 <iosifidis> My university is going to host KDE Akademy (KDE's conference). I am on the organizing committee and I am promoting it to the rest of the academic community.

 20:33 <iosifidis> My university promotes startups, and spinoffs and I am planning to create something using Ubuntu technologies. I am still forming the idea that solves a problem.

 20:33 <iosifidis> My Discourse application is https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/efstathios-iosifidis-membership-application/33695

 20:33 <iosifidis> My wiki is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/iosifidis

 20:34 <iosifidis> And Launchpad is https://launchpad.net/~iosifidis

 20:35 <iosifidis> I am here if you need to clarify anything.

 20:35 <diddledani> thank you. I'll give the board a few moments to have a read through your links and then will open the floor to any questions they may have (and I'll get a glass of water while they do that :-) )

 20:35 <iosifidis> Thanks

 20:37 <diddledani> ok, let's open the floor to questions - first one from me: you've signed the code of conduct. did you understand everything in the code and do you agree to abide by its rules for the duration of your membership should you be successful today?

 20:37 <iosifidis> Yes. Of course.

 20:44 <iosifidis> Thank you.

 20:45 <diddledani> iosifidis: before you go, I'd like to share some info about the perks

 20:45 <iosifidis> OK. I would also like to ask for next steps.

 20:45 <Bashing-om> iosifidis: \o/ !

 20:46 <diddledani> I'll be adding you to the ~ubuntumembers group on LP, after which time your  @ubuntu.com email address should be activated between 48-72 hours. Do *not* set this as your LaunchPad primary email address as that will cause an infinite loop in the forwarding service

 20:47 <diddledani> Also, once I've added you to ~ubuntumembers you'll be able to claim your certificate of membership signed by Mark Shuttleworth at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/. You can see the other perks at https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/perks.

 20:48 <iosifidis> Perfect

 20:48 <diddledani> Could I ask you to send me an email address that will get to you but must be acceptable for you to be publicly visible in the mailing list archives for the announcement of your successful application. Also could you let me know your pronouns (e.g. mine are She/Her). DM is fine for these.

 20:50 <diddledani> With that I'll end the meeting, thank you everyone for coming along, and congratulations again, iosifidis!

 20:50 <Kilos> thanks for chairing agin diddledani

 20:50 <iosifidis> Thank you all for your support.

 20:51 <diddledani> my pleasure, Kilos , and it's the whole board's pleasure, iosifidis <3
