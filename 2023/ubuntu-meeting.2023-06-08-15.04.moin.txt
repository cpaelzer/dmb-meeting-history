 15:04 <bdrung> #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team

 15:04 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:04:02 UTC.  The chair is bdrung.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:04 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:04 <bdrung> #topic Lightning rounds

 15:04 <bdrung> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-8-jun-2023/36137/5

 15:05 <bdrung> I give everybody time to read and ask questions.

 15:10 <mclemenceau> o/

 15:13 <bdmurray> "footgun"

 15:14 <bdrung> I give everyone one more minute for reading.

 15:17 <bdrung> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:17 <bdrung> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:17 <bdrung> nothing there

 15:17 <bdrung> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:18 <bdrung> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aptdaemon/+bug/2008430

 15:20 <vorlon> sounds like something we should take and resolve

 15:20 <vorlon> though I thought all the non-PEP-440 packages were fixed by lunar?

 15:21 <schopin> Yes but basically the point made by the last comment is that non-distro packages that don't respect PEP440 will break apt-daemon, even if they're unrelated.

 15:21 <bdrung> all lunar packages (except for drslib) should have PEP-440 compliant versions.

 15:21 <vorlon> ok

 15:22 <vorlon> anyway, +1 for us taking this, we do rather rely on aptdaemon not exploding

 15:22 * bdrung agrees

 15:23 <bdrung> targetted the bug to lunar

 15:24 <bdrung> tagged foundations-todo and subscribed foundations-bugs

 15:24 <bdrung> next: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+bug/2012698

 15:25 <vorlon> desktop

 15:25 <bdrung> so leaving that untouched

 15:25 <bdrung> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:26 <bdrung> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-8.0/+bug/2019203

 15:27 <vorlon> is this the same as the regression we saw in mysql in mantic-proposed from the security update?

 15:27 <vorlon> it is

 15:27 <schopin> Oh, I subscribed it, but then danilogondolfo looked into it and AFAICT the conclusion was that it wasn't a glibc issue.

 15:27 <schopin> I didn't get around to update the status.

 15:28 <danilogondolfo> I helped investigating the problem. Apparently the kernel doesn't expose information about cache line sizes on armhf and the code relied on that to allocate memory

 15:29 <danilogondolfo> allocate cache-line-size aligned memory*

 15:32 <schopin> I'll mark the glibc status as Invalid then, and add the kernel in the loop.

 15:32 <bdrung> thanks

 15:32 <bdrung> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:33 <bdrung> nothing for us (unless there is something in "unknown")

 15:33 <bdrung> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:33 <bdrung> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:34 <bdrung> that list is short. Enjoy it before Debian unfreezes...

 15:34 <vorlon> indeed

 15:35 <vorlon> fwupd continues to be stuck there

 15:35 <vorlon> there's been discussion on the bug w/ the Debian maintainer but I haven't analyzed it

 15:35 <vorlon> he asserts that there are flaky tests and different behavior across the autopkgtest runners

 15:36 <liushuyu> vorlon: There is a LP bug for it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fwupd/+bug/2021908 and it does not seem to be flaky...?

 15:36 <vorlon> liushuyu: that's the bug Mario repliedto

 15:36 <vorlon> liushuyu: will you continue to drive this one for the next week, or do you need to hand it off?

 15:37 <liushuyu> vorlon: I can take a look after finishing the armhf time_t stuff. It looks like the upstream did not gate the network tests correctly

 15:37 <vorlon> ok

 15:37 <vorlon> that leaves just python-apt needing an assignee

 15:38 <vorlon> any volunteers?

 15:38 <liushuyu> Even if you turn off the network tests, some of them will still run

 15:38 <schopin> o/

 15:38 <vorlon> python-apt: schopin:

 15:38 <vorlon> thanks

 15:38 <vorlon> bdrung: back to you

 15:38 <bdrung> #topic AOB

 15:39 <vorlon> I'll be out next Wed/Thu

 15:39 <mclemenceau> I'm OOO monday

 15:44 <bdrung> #endmeeting
