 16:15 <sil2100> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nkshirsagar/UbuntuPerPackageUploaderApplication

 16:15 <sil2100> Now it's better

 16:15 <sil2100> nkshirsa: o/

 16:15 <nkshirsa> Hello o/

 16:16 <sil2100> So nkshirsa already introduced themselves via e-mail and I asked them some questions already, but feel free to reintroduce yourself again briefly

 16:16 <sil2100> #link https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Nikhil+Kshirsagar&sponsoree_search=name

 16:17 <sil2100> Otherwise, I guess we're open to questions

 16:17 <nkshirsa> Sure. I'm Nikhil Kshirsagar, I've been with Canonical about 2 years working in the SEG team on escalated cases related to cloud and platform storage. I live in Pune, India. I've been using open source for about 10 years now, my main driver OS is Ubuntu of course, but have used red hat and centos/fedora in the past too..

 16:18 <teward> sil2100: link to the email?  since i have 20k unread in my inbox :P

 16:19 <nkshirsa> teward, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2023-June/002288.html

 16:21 <kanashiro[m]> nkshirsa: what would you do if a sosreport upload gets stuck in -proposed because of a regression?

 16:22 <nkshirsa> kanashiro[m], this was what I ran into for the previous release, 4.5.3 .. we discovered a bug in the upstream package that was hit while testing in a juju environment (something that the test cases did not cover)

 16:22 <nkshirsa> But that was a bug discovered upstream. If you mean an autopkgtest regression, I'd look at the update_excuses page for a start..

 16:23 <nkshirsa> and try to identify the cause of the problem from there. If it all looks good, I'd also consider installability issues and take a look at the update_output page to see if its blocked due to some dependency issues or conflicts

 16:23 <kanashiro[m]> yeah, I meant autopkgtest :)

 16:23 <nkshirsa> :-)

 16:24 <teward> nkshirsa: From what I can tell the vast majority of your sosreport work is in sru updates, do you have contributions to devel release or upstream sosreport?  And if not, then why not?

 16:24 <nkshirsa> teward, I do have contributions to upstream sos, I redesigned the ceph plugin in upstream sos , let me dig out the link

 16:25 <teward> s/vast majority/majority if not all/

 16:25 <kanashiro[m]> There are upstream contributions in the application

 16:26 <sil2100> nkshirsa: I'll have a follow up question to your e-mail answers that you gave to my questions

 16:26 <utkarsh2102> nkshirsa: I’m confused with the version of sosreport in Ubuntu. What’s the reason? For example, Lunar has 4.5-1ubuntu0. Which looks odd. And then there’s 4.5.3ubuntu0.23.04.1.

 16:26 <nkshirsa> the majority of the work is SRU updates, that is correct, that's because I am resposible for building/testing the packages each time there's a new upstream release ..

 16:27 <nkshirsa> sil2100, ack

 16:27 <utkarsh2102> nkshirsa: there’s no upstream downstream version separation. That’s weird. Why so?

 16:28 <sil2100> nkshirsa: so I have a follow up question to question 2), so the question about MRE. Your response was good, but I want some additional clarification: in limitations you mentioned that 'or any drastic changes' are not allowed - what would you consider a drastic change?

 16:28 <nkshirsa> utkarsh2102, yeah that was because earlier sos used to be only major release, so 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 etc. for 4.5 they shifted to monthly cadence, and that time we had discussed having just one ubuntu release for the 4.5 series .. so I called it 4.5, and yes the -1 was a mistake .. for the 4.5.3 release we had decided to release more than just 1 major release of 4.5, so that changed the numbering to including the .3 .. it was messy, I plan to take

 16:28 <nkshirsa> care of this carefully going forward..

 16:29 <utkarsh2102> But there’s no separation of the downstream version from the upstream version.

 16:29 <nkshirsa> sil2100, new features, or some new build dependency. Generally MRE's could be considered for bugfix releases upstream

 16:30 <nkshirsa> utkarsh2102, so, 4.5.3 only went into devel. we did not release it for stable since we discoverd the bug during testing proposed.

 16:30 <utkarsh2102> nkshirsa: but do you understand the problem with the version string you’ve chosen?

 16:33 <sil2100> nkshirsa: ok, that's fair, since the important thing is to not change existing behavior of users, which your answer basically incorporates

 16:33 <nkshirsa> yes, there are issues .. firstly, I need the -0 at the end of the upstream release to indicate there's no debian revision. It's optional but only if the package is built for debian purely. If there's no debian package (like for sos), then I need it to be -0. That's one. Secondly I realize that I need ubuntu1 instead of ubuntu0 , but thats something I chose based on what ceph does.. the 23.04.1 implies its the first update ..

 16:33 <nkshirsa> ^^ utkarsh2102 to answer your question in as much detail as I can :-)

 16:34 <sil2100> nkshirsa: it's indeed interesting that sosreport is a native package now starting with lunar?

 16:34 <teward> nkshirsa: As slashd mentioned in your endorsements, you don't seem to have much devel release work on the radar with regards to sosreport - from the sponsorship miner, its primarily SRUs and backports of the versions via SRU.  Is there a primary reason for this?  Its generally unusual to see no devel work

 16:34 <utkarsh2102> nkshirsa: fair, and thanks. Please try to fix the version in the next upload.

 16:35 <teward> also apologies for slow msgs on my end, here via phone today

 16:35 <nkshirsa> utkarsh2102, yes this has been discussed in detail and will be taken care of going forward

 16:35 <sil2100> Ah, it's not a native package, just the versioning indeed needs fixing

 16:35 <utkarsh2102> sil2100: hehe, yeah. I got super confused, too

 16:36 <nkshirsa> yes sil2100 , I need to fix the versioning. I need to have -0 for "no debian package of this version" and also ubuntu1 for "first revision". I chose ubuntu0 based on the way ceph does it.. but its clearer to do it with ubuntu1.. as I mentioned, I will fix the versioning properly for the next release

 16:36 <sil2100> nkshirsa: thanks ;)

 16:36 <sil2100> All good if that's on your radar!

 16:36 <nkshirsa> teward, whatever work I've done upstream in sos, it's been architecture/redesign

 16:36 <nkshirsa> sil2100, yes it is :-)

 16:37 <nkshirsa> teward, also the odd review, bugfixes, and constant discussions with the upstream sos team about stuff that breaks ubuntu specific things..

 16:37 <teward> nkshirsa: i didnt ask about upstream.  i asked about the ubuntu devel release.

 16:37 <teward> not upstream sosreport

 16:39 <sil2100> teward: I do seem new devel release uploads of sosreport there though?

 16:39 <nkshirsa> teward, I make the devel release too, but eric (slashd) pushes it to the upload queue

 16:40 <teward> sil2100: i see three out of a handful of sponsored items

 16:40 <teward> and only one not tied to sru related

 16:41 <teward> hence my question about why theres not as much devel work.  but whatever.

 16:42 <sil2100> teward: well, to be fair, nkshirsa's upload history has selected devel uploads + SRU uploads. It seems sosreport follows a work-process of submitting the new version to all series at once, devel+stable. Only the first SRUs don't have the devel version prepared by nkshirsa

 16:42 <utkarsh2102> fwiw, I’m ready to vote :)

 16:42 <nkshirsa> yes, that is correct.. the first SRU i remember 4.3 , slashd did the devel himself because I was new to the process then

 16:42 <kanashiro[m]> Ready to vote too

 16:43 <sil2100> Any other questions?

 16:43 <teward> sil2100: makes me wonder if this needs a mre then just thinking out loud :P

 16:43 <nkshirsa> 4.4 onwards I've done the devel too.. so basically last 3 releases.. we release a new sosreport typically every 3 months now.. which is why I'm trying to ease taking up b/w from sponsors and work on the uploads myself to speed up things

 16:43 <teward> i am ready to vote

 16:43 <sil2100> teward: it has one! ;)

 16:44 <sil2100> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#sosreport

 16:44 <sil2100> Ok, let's vote then!

 16:44 <teward> blah this is what happens when my inbox is flooddd xD

 16:44 <nkshirsa> yes it does its not for MRE but for stable release exception.. :-)

 16:44 <teward> flooded*

 16:50 <sil2100> ah, there's one from bdmurray

 16:50 <sil2100> [bdmurray] Why is mythbuntu-dev still a delegated team when it isn't a flavor?

 16:50 <sil2100> bdmurray: do you want to take this one?
