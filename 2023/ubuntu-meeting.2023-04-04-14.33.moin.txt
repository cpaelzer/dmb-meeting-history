 14:34 <dviererbe> Hello o/

 14:34 <cpaelzer> hi dviererbe

 14:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: if you are around, jaraco/pytohn-inflect still needs to be resolved

 14:35 <cpaelzer> unless you do not care about the new version migrating - which might be fine given how frozen the release is by now

 14:35 <eslerm> (where is the source code that generates the component svgs?)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> wow - so many pings

 14:36 <cpaelzer> sorry for the delay

 14:37 <cpaelzer> that is a side effect or follow up to germinate

 14:37 <cpaelzer> I tracked it down once but do not have the pointer ready

 14:37 <cpaelzer> does someone else have it right away?

 14:38 <sarnold> heh I can't find ~ubuntu-archive on people.canonical.com, this is a proper tangent :D

 14:38 <cpaelzer> eslerm: we can find out for you

 14:38 <cpaelzer> but maybe not right now in the meeting

 14:38 <eslerm> thank you

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:39 <didrocks> ((yeah, can’t find it anymore either)

 14:39 <didrocks> happy blank page :)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> all of us have looked at it once

 14:39 <cpaelzer> trying to eliminate the false positives

 14:39 <cpaelzer> thought into it

 14:39 <cpaelzer> went crazy

 14:39 <cpaelzer> and that made us forget all that there is

 14:40 <cpaelzer> no new bugs btw

 14:40 <cpaelzer> \o/

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:40 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:41 <cpaelzer> only slyon explaining the inetutils case

 14:41 <cpaelzer> slyon: are you looking for help on this

 14:41 <slyon> I was wondering if cpaelzer or didrocks maybe know an answer to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/inetutils/+bug/2008789/comments/19?

 14:41 <cpaelzer> *reading the last update*

 14:41 <cpaelzer> it is correctly in universe

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I checkd inetutils-ftpd which you used as example

 14:42 <cpaelzer> you can see that in rmadison and other sources

 14:42 <slyon> otherwise we could mark that one "fix released", but this could lead to us accidentally pulling in some of the other inetutils-* binaries in the future (which didn't get security review)

 14:42 <slyon> yes, everything is in the place it's supposed to be

 14:42 <cpaelzer> listed in the extra seed is not equal to "be in main" or "be seeded"

 14:42 <slyon> but we wanted to install some kind of stop-gap to avoid us making mistakes in the future

 14:42 <sarnold> aha!

 14:42 <slyon> as the situation is a bit special, in that we only have a single binary package in main

 14:43 <cpaelzer> we had this before

 14:43 <cpaelzer> and still have in other cases

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I'm afraid that is down to the discipline of the archive admins

 14:43 <cpaelzer> before promoting a random binary to check the MIR that got it added

 14:43 <cpaelzer> which was the reason why we changed our template a few years ago to list this explicitly

 14:43 <cpaelzer> to make it easier

 14:44 <didrocks> yeah, I don’t see it before different (you can argue also that any binary package can grow and ship any new binaries in the same package without that discipline)

 14:44 <cpaelzer> yep

 14:44 <cpaelzer> so slyon, for your case I'd say call it "fix released" ?

 14:44 <slyon> wfm

 14:44 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:44 <cpaelzer> there is one more

 14:44 <dviererbe> \o/

 14:44 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isc-kea/+bug/2002861

 14:45 <cpaelzer> slyon + sarnold : that should now be all right - correct?

 14:46 <cpaelzer> 2003549 + 2003549 both LGTM

 14:46 <sarnold> comment #12 suggests there's still an outstanding step

 14:46 <cpaelzer> that has been done

 14:46 <cpaelzer> that other case is also ready

 14:47 <cpaelzer> here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/log4cplus/+bug/2003549

 14:47 <slyon> looking

 14:48 <cpaelzer> while your are looking, let me move over to the next section

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:48 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:48 <sarnold> the other thing that worried me was the default rest api, but it looks like andreas got that ages ago :)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:49 <cpaelzer> one PR up https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/15

 14:49 <cpaelzer> sarnold: indeed

 14:49 <sarnold> this new PR looks good to me

 14:50 <slyon> cpaelzer: yeah, the only "open" issue seems to be #5 on isc-kea (symbols tracking), but there was some discussion and explanation that we'll skip it for this package, due to maintainability, as stated in comment #10. So MIR ACK for isc-kea

 14:50 <cpaelzer> yep, thanks for adding the example as siggested

 14:50 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon

 14:50 <cpaelzer> slyon: I updated the kea cases to ask for the seed changes

 14:50 <cpaelzer> ok, all seem to be happy with the PR

 14:50 <cpaelzer> merging it now ...

 14:51 <eslerm> thank you

 14:51 <sarnold> \o/.

 14:51 <cpaelzer> stop me now or stay silent forever

 14:51 <didrocks> (crickets…)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:51 <sarnold> web 2.0 is neat, it's fun to see the little icon change live :)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:51 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:51 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:51 <cpaelzer> aren't we at 4.0 at least?

 14:51 <sarnold> hehe

 14:52 <cpaelzer> all ours for this cycle are done

 14:52 <cpaelzer> so for once in ages I'll not friendly-complain

 14:52 <didrocks> you will unfriendly-complain then? :p

 14:52 <cpaelzer> any other team having issues in this that you have concerns about

 14:53 <cpaelzer> no, "friendly thank the security team"

 14:53 <didrocks> \o/

 14:53 <cpaelzer> ok, no one seems to have a case to bring up here

 14:53 <cpaelzer> at least today

 14:53 * sarnold swaps the photo of cpaelzer on the monitor

 14:53 <cpaelzer> unless seb128 who joined wanted to bring something up

 14:53 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:53 <sarnold> yes, two items here

 14:54 <cpaelzer> nothing from me / server-team right now

 14:54 <seb128> no, I just mean every week to join just to check what's going on and be there for questions

 14:54 <seb128> and I keep forgetting, Didier changed a bug status which acted as reminder :p

 14:54 <cpaelzer> ok sarnold, go for them

 14:54 <cpaelzer> seb128: hehe

 14:54 <sarnold> first, I suspect this team needs some changes https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir/+members

 14:54 <seb128> as a FYI we will put dbus-broker in the review queue soon, we would like to transition from dbus-daemon to it next cycle

 14:55 <seb128> that probably impact server and others so take it as a FYI and talk to us if you have concerns

 14:55 <cpaelzer> sarnold: indeed

 14:55 <cpaelzer> doko: would you ok to make me admin there so that I can fix this up fron now on without bothering you?

 14:55 <seb128> (security team gave us a +1 on the apparmor integration front, there is a changeset ready upstream)

 14:55 <cpaelzer> feel free to answer later if you are not around

 14:56 <slyon> seb128: nice!

 14:56 <cpaelzer> seb128: is there a link on the conceptual changes that are to be expected if the two names do not immediately click for us?

 14:56 <sarnold> okay, second issue, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wpebackend-fdo/+bug/1973033  -- there's a jammy task open on this older MIR, and I'm afraid this has fallen off our radar

 14:56 <seb128> cpaelzer, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DbusBrokerAsTheDefaultDbusImplementation

 14:57 <seb128> basically replacing one dbus server implementation by a better alternative other distro already use

 14:57 <slyon> cpaelzer: AFAIU it should be pretty much a drop-in replacement for dbus-daemon

 14:57 <seb128> it should have any visible impact

 14:57 <seb128> *not*

 14:57 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:57 <seb128> :p

 14:57 <cpaelzer> I'd say try to do it early in the cycle so that we have time to spot it

 14:58 <seb128> yes, I plan to queue the MIR request this week

 14:58 <cpaelzer> I've also sent a mail to doko for he same topic sarnold brought up

 14:58 <cpaelzer> to ensure it isn't missed

 14:58 <cpaelzer> thanks seb128, that I consider timely

 14:58 <sarnold> seb128: "and makes use of many modern features provided by recent Linux kernel releases" .. will people be able to run eg naughty nightingale dbus-brokers on a bionic lxd host? focal? jammy?

 14:58 <seb128> let's hope that we don't end up being delayed by half a cycle waiting on a security review

 14:58 * sarnold nods

 14:58 <cpaelzer> sarnold: seb128: the case you brought up https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wpebackend-fdo/+bug/1973033

 14:59 <cpaelzer> that was re-reviewed by slyon

 14:59 <cpaelzer> seen in comment #11

 14:59 <seb128> right, I've in my backlog to address those

 14:59 <seb128> sarnold,   Linux kernel >= 4.17 is described in this page

 14:59 <cpaelzer> ok, so it has not been forgotten

 14:59 <cpaelzer> it is incomplete

 14:59 <cpaelzer> and the state matches

 14:59 <seb128> but https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libwpe/+bug/1973031 is needed

 14:59 <slyon> I think there was another once related, which still needs review from joalif

 14:59 <seb128> and that wasn't reviewed

 14:59 <slyon> this ^

 14:59 <sarnold> seb128: aha, cool, thanks

 15:00 <cpaelzer> seb128: just do realize that this is prone to be missed if going back (as the main task is fix released)

 15:00 <seb128> so there is no point to move the other one meanwhile...

 15:00 <cpaelzer> seb128: so bring it up here in the meeting if in doubt after you think it is ready

 15:00 <seb128> also as a predicted, that a depends now for new webkitgtk

 15:00 <cpaelzer> and that other one is assigned to joalif

 15:00 <seb128> that mdeslaur plans to security update soon

 15:00 <cpaelzer> to do the review

 15:00 <sarnold> d'oh! I hadn't realized there were two bugs with jammy tasks open :( sorry for the confusion

 15:00 <seb128> he said he would push without blocking on MIR review if needed

 15:00 <joalif> oops seems like it fell through the net

 15:00 <seb128> but I let security/MIR sort that out

 15:01 <joalif> i'll do it this week

 15:01 <cpaelzer> ok, so all is going on well then

 15:01 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:01 <cpaelzer> we are out of time

 15:01 <sarnold> cool, thanks :)

 15:01 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:01 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, seb128, all

 15:01 <eslerm> thanks all o/

 15:01 <cpaelzer> I tihnk we are also done for today

 15:01 <slyon> thanks all!

 15:01 <seb128> thanks

 15:01 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
