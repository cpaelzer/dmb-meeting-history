 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <dviererbe> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:31 <slyon> uh oh! What happened to our -perl tree?

 14:32 <luis220413> s_lyon: thanks

 14:32 <cpaelzer> we removed the dependency

 14:32 <cpaelzer> back to a suggest

 14:32 <cpaelzer> as it won't be in time for 23.10

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I can't force sarnold to review 50 in 2 weeks

 14:32 <sarnold> \o/

 14:32 <dviererbe> :D

 14:32 <cpaelzer> interestingly independent to that there is one left in the svg

 14:32 <cpaelzer> dkim-perl->cryptx

 14:33 <cpaelzer> that is a mismatch even with that reduced to a suggest

 14:33 <slyon> but that's desktop's perl tree, not server's

 14:33 <cpaelzer> that is true

 14:34 <cpaelzer> and, other than the old

 14:34 <cpaelzer> it is only in -proposed

 14:34 <cpaelzer> and therefore fine

 14:34 <luis220413> What binaries from src:rustc are depending on binaries from src:fonts-nanum, src:fonts-open-sans and src:highlight.js?

 14:34 <cpaelzer> the whole former stack already did migrate because it was only recommends

 14:34 <cpaelzer> which surprising to me, recommends conflicts only - do not block proposed

 14:34 <slyon> luis220413: that's rust-doc

 14:34 <cpaelzer> -doc usually should go to excludes

 14:35 <cpaelzer> it is auto-included, but quite often it is ok to just exclude the -doc

 14:35 <luis220413> What is excludes?

 14:35 <slyon> luis220413: Extra-Excludes is part of the seeds: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeedManagement/

 14:35 <luis220413> OK

 14:35 <cpaelzer> thank you for answering quicker slyon :-)

 14:35 <slyon> to deny-list certain binary packages

 14:36 <cpaelzer> luis220413: you'll see plenty of similar cases in the git history

 14:36 <cpaelzer> https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu

 14:36 <cpaelzer> now, let us look at the mismatches once more

 14:36 <cpaelzer> jaraco - openstack is aware

 14:36 <cpaelzer> rust -> fonts we just discussed

 14:37 <cpaelzer> libmail-dkim-perl and others - would need Desktop activity if urgent

 14:37 <slyon> wrt rustc component-mismatch. We got the security +1 \o/ So we need didrocks to check the latest comments and let us know if he's fine with that to unblock the MIR

 14:37 <cpaelzer> seb128: ^^ is that important to you?

 14:37 <eslerm> o/

 14:37 <slyon> (well.. cargo MIR, that is. Which is combined with src:rustc)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> he mentioned that he will be unavailable now, but will re-read the log

 14:37 <seb128> which one?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> seb128: https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:38 <cpaelzer> seb128: libmail-dkim-perl is on desktop in http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html

 14:38 <cpaelzer> 2/3 dependencies are already approved from being in main in the past

 14:38 <seb128> I will investigate, I'm not familiar with it

 14:39 <cpaelzer> that is enough for now, thanks seb128

 14:39 <seb128> I (wrongly) assumed that was part of the perl stack being discussed in previous meeting

 14:39 <seb128> sorry about that

 14:39 <cpaelzer> it was maybe hidden in there

 14:39 <cpaelzer> but we had to opt out of this for 23.10 as no one can do so many reviews in time

 14:40 <cpaelzer> so that is what is left visible for the time being

 14:40 <cpaelzer> probably by a sync from debian

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I'd go on with the agenda then

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:40 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vpnc-scripts/+bug/1987571

 14:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/stoken/+bug/1987448

 14:41 <slyon> (I cannot take any MIR reviews today, as I'll be out for an extended leave soon, with no "distro day" left)

 14:41 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:41 <cpaelzer> and I'm crushed by "until end of cycle" high level duties

 14:41 <eslerm> does stoken actually have an owning team?

 14:41 <luis220413> slyon: Until when?

 14:41 <luis220413> eslerm: No

 14:41 <slyon> I'll be back for release week, early October

 14:41 <eslerm> Luis is back from suspension

 14:42 <cpaelzer> eslerm: and he suggested Desktop

 14:42 <luis220413> Nor vpnc-scripts

 14:42 <sarnold> (welcome back :)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I think we need seb128 or anyone else to officially say "yes we'd take it" on stoken + vpnc-scripts

 14:43 <cpaelzer> otherwise there might be a lot of review efforts for Desktop saying "that wasn't our plan"

 14:43 <eslerm> jbicha has closed other related MIRs which were recently reopened

 14:44 <luis220413> Specifically bug 1986592 and bug 1987446

 14:44 <seb128> cpaelzer, I'm also not familiar with those, I will review/consider but I doubt we are interested by those or wanting to commit to maintain them

 14:44 <luis220413> Bug 1986592 is the main one, with the rationale for promoting this set of packages

 14:44 <seb128> it's not for this cycle for sure

 14:45 <luis220413> Then for 24.04?

 14:45 <jbicha> luis220413: comment 2 on 1986592 is significant

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I think we can leave "having a look and discussion" to you both

 14:46 <seb128> yes

 14:46 <cpaelzer> and go on here

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I've assigned them to you and left a comment why

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:47 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> there  is the whole openconnect topic we just handled

 14:48 <cpaelzer> including https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager-openconnect/+bug/1986592 which jbicha referred to

 14:48 <cpaelzer> nothing to act on those for the MIR team

 14:48 <cpaelzer> then https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-reportlab/+bug/2028054

 14:48 <cpaelzer> has found an unexpected solution, will be revisited if it causes issues

 14:49 <cpaelzer> then https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dotnet6/+bug/2023531

 14:49 <cpaelzer> with some back and forther around the discontinue support in LTS

 14:49 <slyon> +1 and thanks for that (wrt python-reportlab)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> notinth to act for us either

 14:49 <dviererbe> I had an SRU exception for a few minutes :/

 14:49 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:49 <cpaelzer> then https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cargo/+bug/1993819

 14:49 <cpaelzer> which we handled above, waiting for didrocks to confirm if all is completed

 14:49 <slyon> this is for didrocks to look into ^ (as was said earlier)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> then https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pappl-retrofit/+bug/2031814

 14:50 <cpaelzer> got a MIR review

 14:50 <slyon> I NACKed this today...

 14:50 <cpaelzer> back to Till to rethink

 14:50 <slyon> It's not needed for this cycle, though.

 14:50 <cpaelzer> ok and last but not least

 14:50 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aom/+bug/2004442

 14:50 <cpaelzer> has todo's left open

 14:50 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:50 <slyon> just a tracking update, showing some progress from our (foundations) side

 14:50 <cpaelzer> that was a lot of "incompletes with updates"

 14:51 <cpaelzer> but all fine in regard to "not waiting to be unblocked by us"

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 14:51 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 14:51 <cpaelzer> FYI I landed the one that was agreed last week and you pinged me on

 14:51 <luis220413> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/39

 14:51 <cpaelzer> I'm not sure we made recent progress to base-sets

 14:52 <cpaelzer> three worth to mention

 14:52 <luis220413> I opened this due to comment 12 to #1986592

 14:52 <luis220413> cpaelzer: Base-sets?

 14:52 <slyon> no. base-sets will be discussed at the next engineering sprint

 14:52 <slyon> (hopefully)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:52 <cpaelzer> so the first to discuss is the one luis220413 linked

 14:52 <cpaelzer> Hmm, ok

 14:53 <cpaelzer> thanks for the report

 14:53 <cpaelzer> this is one of the cases that is clear if you already know it

 14:53 <cpaelzer> The answer is: it is a requirement to have an owning team

 14:53 <cpaelzer> But we need to fix this in the repository

 14:53 <cpaelzer> I can easily write this a bit better and propose a change

 14:54 <cpaelzer> since that will be quick, that should be fine soon

 14:54 <luis220413> cpaelzer: It is a requirement for which stage(s) of the MIR process?

 14:54 <cpaelzer> I'm trying

 14:55 <cpaelzer> luis220413: it is not a requirement to have "the onwing team subscribed" to start the MIR and get the ACK. Oly to get the promotion to main done. But OTOH it is an absolute requitement to "have commitment of a team that will own it" to even enter the process

 14:55 <slyon> luis220413: I guess there are 2 stages: A MIR needs an owning team to be processed AND that team must be subscribed before being promoted by an AA.

 14:56 <slyon> yeah... cpaelzer is probably a bit more detailed

 14:56 <cpaelzer> with time in mind, going on

 14:56 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/38

 14:56 <cpaelzer> dviererbe: I have no idea

 14:56 <dviererbe> I am not sure what to do here; just wanted to let you know that this is weird

 14:57 <cpaelzer> I think that it might not be an external party, but a GH feature we do not know?

 14:57 <cpaelzer> thanks for the report

 14:57 <cpaelzer> question

 14:57 <dviererbe> np

 14:57 <cpaelzer> was https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/36 ready to merge?

 14:57 <cpaelzer> looks that way

 14:57 <cpaelzer> any last need to stop me?

 14:57 <slyon> do it

 14:57 <cpaelzer> done

 14:57 <cpaelzer> and now, time for security

 14:58 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:58 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:58 <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 14:58 <cpaelzer> things keep looking good

 14:58 <cpaelzer> anything of concern sarnold / eslerm that you want to bring up?

 14:58 <sarnold> (especially without a perl tree to tend to :)

 14:58 <cpaelzer> well, we have the first few of the perl tree

 14:58 <cpaelzer> and the rest will come later

 14:58 <cpaelzer> but yes, only root-work now

 14:59 <eslerm> nothing to bring up, I'll push for s390-tools assignment this week

 14:59 <cpaelzer> great

 14:59 <cpaelzer> jfh will be happy to hear that

 14:59 <cpaelzer> in that case

 14:59 <cpaelzer> let me go on

 14:59 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:59 <luis220413> Yes

 14:59 <cpaelzer> nothing from me

 14:59 <sarnold> none here

 14:59 <joalif> none

 14:59 <eslerm> none

 14:59 <cpaelzer> yes = another topic luis220413?

 15:00 <luis220413> cpaelzer: Exactly

 15:00 <slyon> kudos for the security to finish libei review quickly, to unblock the desktop team!

 15:00 <cpaelzer> indeed

 15:00 <eslerm> thanks amurray \o/

 15:00 <luis220413> I would like to have libwpe and wpebackend-fdo promoted to main in Focal to be able to have WebKitGTK 2.40.5 in the official archive

 15:01 <luis220413> I have successfully built it (despite upstream's lack of support) and Yelp works well with it

 15:01 <luis220413> *lack of support for Focal

 15:01 <luis220413> The bugs are bug #1973031 and bug #1973033 (I have not changed them)

 15:01 <jbicha> luis220413: I don't think the *wpe* issue is a blocker for webkitgtk 2.40 reaching Focal

 15:02 <luis220413> Thanks, but I said this because, from 1973031 it appeared that *wpe* would become mandatory for WebKitGTK starting from 2.40

 15:02 <jbicha> however, the Ubuntu Security team currently doesn't plan to release webkitgtk 2.40 to Focal

 15:03 <jbicha> I'm saying there are other issues & webkitgtk support for Focal has reached Security End of Life

 15:03 <jbicha> we can discuss more after this meeting if needed since I don't think this is a MIR team issue now

 15:04 <luis220413> OK

 15:04 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:04 <cpaelzer> in that case

 15:04 <cpaelzer> closing

 15:04 <cpaelzer> thank you all!

 15:05 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 15:05 <slyon> thanks all! o/

 15:05 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting

 15:05 <eslerm> thanks all o/

 15:05 <dviererbe> thanyk you all! o/

 15:05 <luis220413> Thank you all! o/

 15:05 <joalif> thanks all

 15:06 <jbicha> luis220413: if you want to discuss webkitgtk/focal more, I suggest asking in #ubuntu-security

 15:13 <didrocks> cpaelzer: ok, it seems in the end that there is no action outside of cargo for me or anything else I can take?

 15:15 <cpaelzer> no, just cargo AFAIR

 19:00 <rbasak> o/

 19:00 <seb128> o/

 19:01 <seb128> amurray, vorlon, sil2100, around?

 19:09 <seb128> #topic AOB

 19:09 <seb128> :p

 19:09 <seb128> any other topic?

 19:09 <vorlon> I can put this on the mailing list if desired, but I'd like to request another variance of the schedule

 19:09 <vorlon> to push the next meeting out to 3 weeks from today instead of 1

 19:09 <vorlon> instead of 2

 19:09 <sil2100> I might have something for next meeting, since I'd like to first have a chat with the toolchain squad

 19:10 <seb128> I'm fine doing 2->3 weeks

 19:10 <amurray> same

 19:10 <seb128> I think we have enough people to decide here/now

 19:10 <sil2100> I don't mind

 19:10 <seb128> rbasak, ?

 19:12 <seb128> well I guess we have quorum even without him, I will update the wikipage to reflect that

 19:12 <rbasak> Sorry, reading

 19:12 <seb128> any other topic?

 19:12 <rbasak> And checking my calendar

 19:13 <rbasak> 3 weeks is OK for me.

 19:13 <seb128> great

 19:13 <rbasak> Nothing else from me thanks

 19:14 <seb128> alright, 30s for other topics if anyone has one!

 19:14 <seb128> thanks everyone!
