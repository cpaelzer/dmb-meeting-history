 19:14 * meetingology micahg to ask IRC team to update dmb-ping once team updates happen

 19:15 <micahg_work> let's start with applications

 19:15 * micahg_work is looking for Unit193 quickly

 19:16 <micahg_work> ok, moving to coreycb since he's here

 19:17 <coreycb> o/

 19:17 <coreycb> Hi

 19:17 <micahg_work> #topic applications for ubuntu-server upload rights for Corey Bryant

 19:17 <micahg_work> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CoreyBryant/UbuntuServerDeveloperApplication

 19:22 <bdmurray> coreycb: Could you tell us a bit about yourself?

 19:22 <xnox> micahg: seems to have network problems.

 19:22 <coreycb> Sure

 19:22 <micahg_work> yes, sorry

 19:23 <xnox> coreycb: how do you envision openstack moving to python3 only? python3 only in Ubuntu?

 19:23 <coreycb> I work on OpenStack packaging and it's dependencies for Ubuntu.

 19:23 <coreycb> well we've started to migrate the python clients to python3

 19:24 <coreycb> So it's in the works, and upstream is also working to move to python3

 19:24 <coreycb> A little more about myself..

 19:25 <doko> wily will be 3.5 as the default

 19:25 <coreycb> I've been packaging since early 2014

 19:25 <coreycb> and have since started to take over a lot of the SRUs

 19:25 <coreycb> and have contributed a decent amount to the new release (liberty)

 19:26 <coreycb> so having upload rights would be a big help for streamlining our process, and take some load off of zul and jamespage

 19:27 <infinity> coreycb: Would be a better question for Chuck or James, but I'll trust you to answer honestly: On average, when they're sponsoring for you, how often would you say they find issues you need to fix?

 19:28 <coreycb> infinity, less than 5% I'd say

 19:28 <coreycb> typically I consult with them before issues come up

 19:29 <infinity> coreycb: And, I assume, with upload rights, that process won't change?  You'll still ask for input from your peers if something seems a bit off or needs another set of eyes?

 19:29 <xnox> coreycb: could you describe in general terms what stages a package goes through from upload by developer, until it reaches the users of the development release wily? why might it not reach those users?

 19:30 <coreycb> infinity, definitely

 19:30 <coreycb> xnox, sure

 19:30 <coreycb> well most packages start in debian obviously

 19:30 <coreycb> and we have to do a lot of syncs and merges with debian

 19:31 <coreycb> and once those packages are in universe we need to get them into main for many of the openstack packages, the supported ones

 19:31 <coreycb> when uploading, we'll upload to wily-proposed

 19:32 <coreycb> and the packages then move to wily-updates (post release)

 19:32 <coreycb> or straight to wily pocket pre-release

 19:32 <xnox> ok.

 19:32 <infinity> coreycb: I think he was asking for all the proposed -> ??, ??, ?? -> release steps in between. ;)

 19:33 <xnox> coreycb: and why/how things might not end up in the wily pocket pre-release?

 19:33 <xnox> (second part of the question)

 19:33 <coreycb> xnox, right so issues might occur with autopkgtesting

 19:33 <coreycb> in migration to proposed

 19:34 <coreycb> we'd need to evaulate various issues that could occur in update excuses

 19:34 <xnox> ok. sounds good.

 19:36 <coreycb> infinity, so yeah wily-proposed to -> wily-updates -> cloud archive might be what you're looking for

 19:36 <xnox> coreycb: in update excuses what does "missing build on amd64" mean? is that a problem for a pure-python package (arch:all)?

 19:36 <infinity> coreycb: So, historically, openstack packages have suffered two major issues in proposed-migration.  One just being new deps that cause a transition/blockage and need MIRs and the like to sort out.  You've been really good about keeping on top of that (thanks).

 19:36 <infinity> coreycb: The other major issue is that sometimes autopkgtest regressions go unnoticed/unresolved for weeks.  Do you have a plan to make sure that happens less often, and how?

 19:37 * xnox is mostly asking silly questions cause i naver worked/sponsored coreycb thus try to probe where on contributor - core-dev spectrum the applicant is.

 19:37 <coreycb> xnox, no I don't think that's an issue for a pure python package since it's interpreted

 19:37 <xnox> coreycb: what does FTBFS mean?

 19:37 <coreycb> fails to build from source

 19:37 <infinity> coreycb: xnox's question was (unintentionally?) a trick question, BTW, since amd64 is the arch that builds arch:all packages in vivid and later. :)

 19:38 <doko> do you known how to fix it?

 19:38 <coreycb> doko, ftbfs?

 19:38 <doko> heh, yes

 19:38 <xnox> coreycb: ... thus there would be no binary .deb of a said python package if it fails to build from source.

 19:39 <coreycb> doko, it probably depends, but recently I diagnosed an ftbfs in the cloud archive for liberty and tests were failing due to a missing dep

 19:39 <doko> and how do you become aware of packages that ftbfs which you don't upload yourself?

 19:39 <coreycb> doko, well in that case it was the cloud archive so we have a mailing list for that

 19:40 <coreycb> doko, I think here -- http://qa.ubuntuwire.org/ftbfs/

 19:40 <xnox> coreycb: "no I don't think that's an issue for a pure python package since it's interpreted" this is wrong by the way. "missing build on amd64" means .deb was never created for this package, and it means it never got build and will not propagate. It could be that it is failing to build from source (like you said bugs/errors in testsuite etc) or it could be in dep-wait state (build dependencies not satisfied). When in dep-wait state launchpad

 19:40 <xnox> doesn't even attempt to build the packages.

 19:40 <bdmurray> micahg_work: I don't we need Laney for the input-methods discussion

 19:40 <xnox> coreycb: and yeah, tricky cause amd64 compiles _all.deb packages for us (as infinity said)

 19:41 <xnox> in willy.

 19:41 <micahg_work> bdmurray, right, I noticed the comment in his email and I'm ready to bring it up once we're done with this topic

 19:42 <coreycb> infinity, sorry I missed your qeustion

 19:42 <infinity> coreycb: S'ok, you're kinda getting slammed from all sides here. :P

 19:43 <xnox> infinity: but so far the answers are handled well, for the archive rights application is for.

 19:43 <xnox> imho.

 19:43 <coreycb> infinity, re autopkgtest regressions.  setting time aside each week to evaluate things like component mismatches, or update excuses, or bug triaging is something I need to do.

 19:43 <micahg_work> coreycb, on that topic, Laney noticed that your last two uploads seem to be stuck in dependency wait status, have you been working on resolving that?

 19:43 <coreycb> infinity, :)

 19:44 <xnox> coreycb: have you ever participated in a transition? e.g. migration to a new major version of something rather (python, boost, gcc, or any other smaller libraries)?

 19:44 <coreycb> micahg_work, yes, well liberty is a new release now so it's really in some of the busiest parts of the openstack packaging release lifecycle

 19:44 <coreycb> micahg_work, so some things do need attention but yeah it's a balance, and we have a list of done and to-do :)

 19:46 <coreycb> xnox, If I understand your question, we're about to do that with openstack actually, as they're moving to a new versioning scheme

 19:46 <coreycb> xnox, so we'll need to add an epoch to the version

 19:47 <xnox> coreycb: ack. sounds good.

 19:47 <xnox> coreycb: you might find transition tracker useful for that. It takes syntax to mark things as good/bad and then one can easily track progress of such things.

 19:48 <micahg_work> coreycb, right, I understand there are chicken and egg issues, I was wondering if you've followed up at all and if so, what's happening with those packages' dependencies

 19:48 <xnox> E.g. here is the tracker for upcomming libstdc++ abi transition http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/transitions/html/libstdc++6.html

 19:48 <coreycb> xnox, thanks I'll look into that

 19:48 <coreycb> micahg_work, did you have one in particular?

 19:49 <coreycb> micahg_work, we probably have some MIRs being settled

 19:49 <micahg_work> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/heat/1:5.0.0~b1-0ubuntu1/+build/7628909

 19:49 <micahg_work> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceilometer/1:5.0.0~b1-0ubuntu2/+build/7635433

 19:50 <coreycb> micahg_work, heat is waiting on python-designateclient which we have an MIR open for

 19:50 <coreycb> and is dependent on a new python-cliff which is working it's way through from debian

 19:52 <coreycb> micahg_work, ceilometer is waiting on python-awsauth, we have an MIR open for that too

 19:56 <micahg_work> so, heat needs the new python-cliff or python-designateclient?

 19:58 <coreycb> heat needs python-designateclient and python-designateclient needs python-cliff, but I don't see cliff in component mismatches so maybe it's ok.  I need to check rmadison to see what version we haven ow.

 19:58 <coreycb> s/ow/now

 19:59 <coreycb> micahg_work, ah.

 20:00 <coreycb> micahg_work, I believe we have a new version of python-designateclient in debian we need to sync

 20:01 <micahg_work> coreycb, so, is this a requirement of the MIR or of heat?

 20:02 <micahg_work> (new version that is)

 20:02 <coreycb> micahg_work, no actually sorry I think I'm just confusing things

 20:02 <micahg_work> ok

 20:05 <coreycb> micahg_work, I'm not sure why python-designateclient isn't in main yet.  The MIR's been fix committed.

 20:05 <coreycb> it appears to be building ok

 20:05 <coreycb> I might just need to poke the release team

 20:06 <micahg_work> right, I was wondering if you or your team regularly follow up on those

 20:06 <coreycb> micahg_work, we do yes, I'm starting to

 20:06 <micahg_work> great

 20:06 <micahg_work> ok, any other questions

 20:07 <coreycb> micahg_work, none from me :)
