<a href="#l-19" name="l-19"><span class="tm">19:33</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> Hello everyone, i'm Jackson Doak. I've been doing packaging work since mid 2013, and would like to gain upload rights.
<a href="#l-20" name="l-20"><span class="tm">19:33</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> Is there anything specific i should be saying?
<a href="#l-21" name="l-21"><span class="tm">19:35</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> no. we will ask you questions.
<a href="#l-22" name="l-22"><span class="tm">19:35</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> A large portion of my work is keeping Xfce/Xubuntu up to date, as well as other, minor DEs
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:36 </span><span class="nka">* bdrung</span> <span class="ac">is still reading the application wiki (sorry for not having time to do that earlier)</span>
<a href="#l-24" name="l-24"><span class="tm">19:36</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> so xfce you are using xfce?
<a href="#l-25" name="l-25"><span class="tm">19:36</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> yes
<a href="#l-26" name="l-26"><span class="tm">19:38</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;stgraber&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> so it's been exactly a month since your last application, what steps did you take to resolve some of the hilighted issues?
<a href="#l-27" name="l-27"><span class="tm">19:39</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> I've been making sure i test build everything i work on, and only taking patches that have been tested
<a href="#l-28" name="l-28"><span class="tm">19:40</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> Also, reading debian and upstream changelogs more extensively
<a href="#l-29" name="l-29"><span class="tm">19:40</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> I believe my quality of work has improved in the last month, and since i first applied in january. Next month i should finally have my dev PC working too.
<a href="#l-30" name="l-30"><span class="tm">19:44</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg-work&gt;</span> Noskcaj, so, you made a call for sponsoring shortly after the last meeting, but there was an issue with that, do you understand what that was and what steps would you take to prevent that from happening in the future
<a href="#l-31" name="l-31"><span class="tm">19:45</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> micahg, yes. I made a call for sponsoring during a freeze which meant very few things could actually get sponsored, plus i said some changes were "release critical", but that was only for final release
<a href="#l-32" name="l-32"><span class="tm">19:47</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> In future i won't call for sponsoring in freezes, and will check if a package is seeded before uploading
<a href="#l-33" name="l-33"><span class="tm">19:49</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> what steps do you do before uploading (or requesting an upload)?
<a href="#l-34" name="l-34"><span class="tm">19:50</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> Check no one else is working on the package, test build it and make sure i'm not adding regressions, check if it's affected by any current freezes/transitions, upload
<a href="#l-35" name="l-35"><span class="tm">19:51</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> how do you test to not introduce regressions?
<a href="#l-36" name="l-36"><span class="tm">19:52</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> changelog checking, testbuilding, automated checks like lintian and blhc, upstream bug trackers, not packaging unstable releases unless needed
<a href="#l-37" name="l-37"><span class="tm">19:54</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> do you install the packages and run them before uploading?
<a href="#l-38" name="l-38"><span class="tm">19:54</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> bdrung, When possible, but it's difficult for me to do due to hardware limitation. That will be fixed in a few weeks time
<a href="#l-39" name="l-39"><span class="tm">19:55</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> (When i will have my VM server finished)
<a href="#l-40" name="l-40"><span class="tm">19:56</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> are you subscribed to the ubuntu-devel-announce mailing list?
<a href="#l-41" name="l-41"><span class="tm">19:56</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> yes
<a href="#l-42" name="l-42"><span class="tm">19:59</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg-work&gt;</span> Noskcaj, could you please explain the difference between CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS
<a href="#l-43" name="l-43"><span class="tm">20:00</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> They are all makefile macros. Cflags is for C only, CXXflags is for C++, CPPflags for both
<a href="#l-44" name="l-44"><span class="tm">20:02</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> why is CPPFLAGS for both?
<a href="#l-45" name="l-45"><span class="tm">20:03</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> It's where preprocessor flags go, which both c and C++ use
<a href="#l-46" name="l-46"><span class="tm">20:06</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg-work&gt;</span> Noskcaj, where's your reference for that?
<a href="#l-47" name="l-47"><span class="tm">20:06</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5541946/cflags-ccflags-cxxflags-what-exactly-do-these-variables-control
<a href="#l-48" name="l-48"><span class="tm">20:06</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> I don't know C or C++, but i do understand what the flags do
<a href="#l-49" name="l-49"><span class="tm">20:07</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg-work&gt;</span> Noskcaj, did you notice the first comment on that response?
<a href="#l-50" name="l-50"><span class="tm">20:07</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> oh
<a href="#l-51" name="l-51"><span class="tm">20:07</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> 1. I feel stupid now 2. Thanks for telling me to look there
<a href="#l-52" name="l-52"><span class="tm">20:08</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg-work&gt;</span> Noskcaj, I certainly did not intend to make you feel stupid
<a href="#l-53" name="l-53"><span class="tm">20:09</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> no questions are left. so let's vote.

<a href="#l-126" name="l-126"><span class="tm">20:47</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;Noskcaj&gt;</span> If i may ask, why is the whole dmb so rarely present at meetings?
<a href="#l-127" name="l-127"><span class="tm">20:47</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;bdrung&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> as stgraber already said, I assume you will get the missing vote and the PPU will be granted.

For example, the early meeting is in my work time and I can only attend if I do not have an other meeting.
<a href="#l-129" name="l-129"><span class="tm">20:49</span></a><span class="nk"> &lt;stgraber&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Noskcaj:</span> because most DMB members work, some have to travel (like ScottK today) and for some it's just too late or too early based on their repsective timezones
