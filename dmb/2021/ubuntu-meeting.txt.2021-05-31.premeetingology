[15:01] <ddstreet> 0/
[15:01] <ddstreet> holiday for me so hopefully will be a short mtg
[15:06] <sil2100> Yeah, I don't see anything on the agenda
[15:06] <sil2100> And I guess there's just the two of us?
[15:06] <sil2100> ...or maybe there's more people on freenode?
[15:06] <ddstreet> nobody talking in this channel over there
[15:06] <ddstreet> i think it's just us
[15:07] <ddstreet> so looks like have to skip the mtg again this week
[15:07] <sil2100> I'd recommend skipping, and maybe just staying around a bit in case someone has questions
[15:07] <ddstreet> sounds good
