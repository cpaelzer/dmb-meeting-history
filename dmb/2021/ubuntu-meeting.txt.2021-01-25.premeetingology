[19:09] <ddstreet> looks like no quorum for the dmb mtg today, but there's no applications or other business in the agenda, so that is hopefully ok. I'm considering this week's meeting skipped.
[19:14] <teward> ddstreet: no objection.  any issues we needed to bring up can be brought to ML or email privately.
[19:17] <rafaeldtinoco> ok for me as well
