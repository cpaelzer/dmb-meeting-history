 15:11 <ddstreet> yeah, no rollover, unless anyone else thinks it's something we should keep on the carryover list

 15:12 <teward> we need an internal tracker board.

 15:24 <teward> (sorry i am impatient)

 15:24 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: no, please help me

 15:24 <teward> (those commands are for the meeting logs' benefits)

 15:24 <rafaeldtinoco> nice, now its introduction time ?

 15:24 <teward> kanashiro: are you around?

 15:25 <rbasak> Since Lucas is a close colleague of mine at Canonical I do my usual abstaining unless the others are unanimous and my vote is required for quorum.

 15:25 <sil2100> rbasak: o/

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> +1 on what rbasak said

 15:25 <teward> rbasak: awesome.  (didn't realize you were alive heh)

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> I'm on the same team as well

 15:25 <rbasak> Sorry I was in a meeting at the start (same as Rafael)

 15:25 <teward> no problem

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> i was saving rbasak to talk until super needed

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> as he was talking in other meeting

 15:25 <teward> rbasak: with you and rafaeldtinoco taking abstains though, that means we don't have quorum for LUcas' application

 15:26 <rbasak> That's OK. I will vote +1 if everyone else does and it is required for quroum.

 15:26 <teward> ack

 15:26 <teward> i don't see them here though

 15:26 <rbasak> That's been my personal policy for this kind of situation for years.

 15:26 <rafaeldtinoco> and im mimic'ing his behavior not to characterize conflict of interest

 15:26 <teward> indeed.

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> slashd: ping ?

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> eric is on a sprint this week, just checking if he is up to a quick vote

 15:28 <sil2100> I wonder if kanashiro is around though

 15:28 <rbasak> Looks like he is

 15:28 <rbasak> Let's give him a minute

 15:28 <rbasak> He says he's sending messages but they aren't appearing in here

 15:29 <ahasenack> nickserv

 15:29 <rafaeldtinoco> Mode: +Ccnz

 15:29 <sil2100> Did he identify himself with NickServ properly?

 15:29 <rafaeldtinoco> kanashiro: try leaving and re-joining the channel

 15:29 <teward> we can +v them if we have to manually

 15:29 <teward> i think i had to do that an eon ago for a DMB meeting to move smoothly (before I was DMB)

 15:29 <rbasak> Well this is an interesting twist

 15:30 <kanashiro> o/

 15:30 <teward> (the second time I've had to op today - new record!)

 15:30 <teward> sorry about the confusion kanashiro :)

 15:30 <rbasak> (we can see you now)

 15:30 <kanashiro> great :)

 15:30 <kanashiro> sorry for that

 15:30 <rafaeldtinoco> nah its ok

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: so how should we proceed ?

 15:31 <teward> they're alive so

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> it appears that without you and me.. we have 3 possible votes

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> i called slashd

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> he is likely comming

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> lets see

 15:31 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: rbasak already said they'd +1 if it's +3 for us

 15:31 <ddstreet> yeah we should just go ahead

 15:31 <teward> but we can either wait for slashd or continue or roll over

 15:31 <slashd> o/

 15:31 <ddstreet> i think we have enough to vote

 15:31 <teward> i think we're safe to move forward

 15:31 <teward> welcome slashd

 15:31 <teward> now we definitely do

 15:31 <slashd> I'm here if you need to meet quorum

 15:31 <slashd> sorry sprinting this week

 15:31 <teward> slashd: we will need it for this one

 15:31 <teward> no problem

 15:31 <rafaeldtinoco> slashd: yey!

 15:32 <slashd> sure

 15:32 <slashd> I'm here

 15:32 <teward> slashd: after this applicant you can go AWOL again :0

 15:32 <teward> (i'mma keep op to reset perms post-meeting)

 15:32 <rafaeldtinoco> kanashiro: so, present yourself now

 15:32 <rafaeldtinoco> please

 15:32 <kanashiro> I am Lucas Kanashiro (a.k.a. kanashiro) and I am a member of the Canonical Server team. I've been working on server packages (fixing bugs, merges, syncs, reviews, bug triage) and personally taking care of the Ruby stack (interpreter, apps, libraries), and I've gone through most of the processes used by the community at least once (MIR, SRU, seed changes, merge, sync, transition, CVE fix, proposed migration work, package removal). I'd like to

 15:32 <kanashiro> be more independent to do my work and help to make Ubuntu even better.

 15:33 <rafaeldtinoco> great. let's give sometime for votes to check your wiki

 15:34 <kanashiro> ack

 15:34 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: should we do something when opening for questions ?

 15:34 <rafaeldtinoco> change topic ?

 15:34 <slashd> rafaeldtinoco: just for voting, question period doesn't require changing things

 15:34 <teward> nope

 15:34 <teward> leave it be rafaeldtinoco :)

 15:34 <teward> kanashiro: totally unrelated random question not related to your application but as being on the server team: any reason you don't lurk #ubuntu-server ?

 15:35 <teward> just curious :)

 15:35 <kanashiro> teward: I think I had some issue with my IRC bouncer and got disconnected

 15:35 <teward> ah.

 15:35 <teward> :)

 15:35 <kanashiro> I'll figure this out

 15:35 <teward> no problem :)

 15:35 <teward> no questions from me

 15:36 <ddstreet> kanashiro are you subscribed to all bugs from any packages?

 15:36 <ddstreet> (it's not required, i'm just curious)

 15:36 <kanashiro> ddstreet: I don't think so, I am still learning how to use launchpad properly

 15:37 <kanashiro> but I should, at least for the core packages

 15:37 <rafaeldtinoco> Only thing worth mentioning from me is that I have uploaded maybe 70% of his package changes for the ruby2.7 transition. He did all the work in debian and synced it to Ubuntu PLUS solving all excuses that appeared (quote a lot). I follow this work of him for ~2 months.

 15:37 <slashd> kanashiro: what are the things you need to consider before uploading in developement release when it is a few weeks away from being stable (most recent example is focal which became stable lately) ? and where would you look to see it what can be done or not ?

 15:39 <kanashiro> slashd: if there is a hard freeze I'd need an approval by the release team, so I need to check if no new feature is introduces (ABI changes). To make sure about the release schedule I'd check the release team wiki page and check the dates

 15:40 <kanashiro> not sure if this is what you were expecting as an answer

 15:40 <slashd> kanashiro: yes thanks

 15:40 <sil2100> kanashiro: since you have worked on bigger things as transitions, can you tell me what additional information can you get from update_output.txt that you can't from update_excuses.html?

 15:41 <kanashiro> sil2100: I have faced some uninstability issues and output.txt has helped me to identifying them

 15:41 <rbasak> ddstreet: FWIW, our team has our own process for making sure all bug traffic gets seen, so we generally don't have individual subscriptions (bus factor).

 15:42 <teward> ^ this

 15:42 <teward> i can confirm this with how frequently the Server Team at canonical are triaging nginx without anything of my doing xD

 15:43 <ddstreet> yep, i do know of ~ubuntu-server subscription to lots of packages, there are some members who subscribe individually to pkgs too though

 15:44 <rafaeldtinoco> kanashiro: you should do it ^ for the pkgs you want to maintain.

 15:44 <rafaeldtinoco> its a nice best practice

 15:44 <kanashiro> rafaeldtinoco: yes, I need to do that

 15:45 <teward> just don't do what tsimonq2 does and subscribe to all the bugs via the bugs mailing list...

 15:45 <teward> ... seriously just don't xD

 15:45 <kanashiro> :)

 15:46 * rafaeldtinoco leaving it opened for questions, let me know if/when you're all ok

 15:46 <teward> (seriously don't i won't explain the specifics here bug me in PM if you really want to know lol)

 15:46 <teward> NO questions from me :)

 15:46 <ddstreet> nothing else from me

 15:46 <slashd> nothing else

 15:51 * meetingology sil2100 to add kanashiro coredev permissions and send announcement

 15:52 <ddstreet> ok :)

 15:52 <teward> sil because i didn't see your claim sorry :)

 15:52 <ddstreet> np happy to let him have it :)

 15:52 <teward> well that's the only application for today :)

 15:52 <teward> so next...

 15:52 <rafaeldtinoco> looks like we're done

 15:52 <teward> #topic Outstanding mailing list requests to assign

 15:52 <Odd_Bloke> I did _just_ send a request for cloud-utils to be added to ubuntu-cloud.

 15:52 <Odd_Bloke> (No rush on that, it can wait for next meeting.)

 15:53 <teward> Odd_Bloke: That'll be caught between now and next meeting :)

 15:53 <teward> #subtopic Refresh the packagesets (Sebastien Bacher)

 15:53 <teward> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001486.html

 15:53 <rafaeldtinoco> that is on me

 15:53 <rafaeldtinoco> being carried over together with the packageset scripts

 15:53 <teward> #action rafaeldtinoco to handle "Refresh the packagesets" mailing list item (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001486.html)

 15:53 * meetingology rafaeldtinoco to handle "Refresh the packagesets" mailing list item (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001486.html)

 15:54 <teward> #subtopic Including yaru-theme in the in ubuntu-desktop set (Sebastien Bacher)

 15:54 <teward> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001487.html

 15:54 <rafaeldtinoco> looks like it wasnt picked automatic because of the same reasons ?

 15:54 <ddstreet> for this (and the next one), i'm super confused about what the desktop-extras packageset is for

 15:55 <teward> ddstreet: we'll mark this as 'rolled over' pending an AOB item for this

 15:55 <teward> i'll roll over both items for that reason

 15:55 <rafaeldtinoco> gnome-shell needs to be added

 15:55 <rafaeldtinoco> in the exceptions list from the packageset tooling

 15:55 <rafaeldtinoco> if im reading correctly, sometimes pkgs are put in "wrong"  set

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> and we have to make them exceptions

 15:56 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: do you want an action item to handle that part?  Since you're the one handling the tooling currently

 15:56 <ddstreet> i guess?  i'm not sure what 'desktop-core' is intended for though, since there are no uploaders in that pkgset

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> gnome-shell         ubuntu-desktop <- currently

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 15:56 <ddstreet> thnx

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> all the "same nature" actions

 15:56 <teward> #action rafaeldtinoco to handle getting gnome-shell into ubuntu desktop exceptions list

 15:56 * meetingology rafaeldtinoco to handle getting gnome-shell into ubuntu desktop exceptions list

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> i'll handle for the next meeting

 15:56 <rafaeldtinoco> together with the scripting

 15:57 <teward> @action rafaeldtinoco to look into mailing list item "INcluding yaru-theme in the ubuntu-desktop set" (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001487.html)

 15:57 <teward> oops

 15:57 <teward> #action rafaeldtinoco to look into mailing list item "INcluding yaru-theme in the ubuntu-desktop set" (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001487.html)

 15:57 <teward> does this also apply to fprint?

 15:57 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 15:57 <teward> #action rafaeldtinoco to look into mailing list item "Include fprint pacakges in the ubuntu-desktop set" (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-April/001488.html)

 15:58 <rafaeldtinoco> all those issues come from the same place: adjusting the packagesets automatically and having exceptions

 15:58 <rafaeldtinoco> nice

 15:58 <teward> awesome

 15:58 <rafaeldtinoco> ill have this all addressed by next meeting

 15:58 <teward> next quick little item:

 15:58 <teward> #topic Chair and Time for Next Meeting

 15:58 <teward> Next meeting is set for May 18, 2020 at 19:00 UTC.  Chair is scheduled to be rbasak per the cycling list of chairs.

 15:58 <teward> rbasak: will you be available for next meeting?

 15:59 <teward> (if not i'm happy to chair heh)

 15:59 <teward> (again)

 15:59 <rafaeldtinoco> i can chair it

 15:59 <rafaeldtinoco> now that i know the commands

 15:59 <rafaeldtinoco> thanks for stepping in to help me

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> specially because ill have many items being addressed

 16:00 <teward> yep

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> so it will require me big time anyway

 16:00 <teward> i'll leave it alone for now :)

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> ok

 16:00 <teward> so rafaeldtinoco you will chair :)

 16:00 <teward> and i'll still help out :)

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> great. thx

 16:00 <teward> #topic Any Other Business

 16:00 <sil2100> No AOB here

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> n/a

 16:00 <rafaeldtinoco> ops

 16:01 <rafaeldtinoco> WAIT

 16:01 <rafaeldtinoco> I have it

 16:01 <sil2100> hm?

 16:01 <rafaeldtinoco> but we probably want to push those to later this year

 16:01 <rafaeldtinoco> i was going to suggest to move bzr repos (tooling)

 16:01 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: ddstreet: did you want to discuss ubuntu-desktop/desktop-core during this AOB?

 16:01 <rafaeldtinoco> to git

 16:01 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: they are in git already

 16:01 <teward> last i checked a git repo was made for them already

 16:01 <teward> at least for the packageset tooling

 16:02 <sil2100> rafaeldtinoco: which tooling do you have in mind?

 16:02 <ddstreet> teward i'm ok waiting until next mtg for that, i think with rafaeldtinoco docs on the tooling it may be clearer

 16:02 <rafaeldtinoco> yes, they are, not the archive-tools though

 16:02 <teward> ah ok

 16:02 <teward> ddstreet: ack

 16:02 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 16:02 <rafaeldtinoco> lets just wait on this

 16:02 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: add that as an agenda item when you are ready to discuss it :)

 16:02 <rafaeldtinoco> we all have many stuff

 16:02 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: yep, all good for now

 16:02 <teward> any other business from anyone?

 16:02 <teward> (30s)

 16:02 <teward> (20s)

 16:02 <teward> (10s)

 16:03 <teward> (5s)

 16:03 <rafaeldtinoco> that was fast

 16:03 <rbasak> ubuntu-archive-tools isn't down to the DMB unfortunately

 16:03 <rafaeldtinoco> your clock should be monotonic

 16:03 <rbasak> It needs ~ubuntu-archive to move it

 16:03 <rafaeldtinoco> just saying

 16:03 <teward> heh

 16:03 <rbasak> But yes, it should be moved :)

 16:03 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: yes, i saw that later also

 16:03 <teward> makes sense rbasak :)  we'll bring that up later as well

 16:03 <teward> guess there's no other business then?

 16:03 <teward> thanks all for attending!

 16:03 <teward> #endmeeting
