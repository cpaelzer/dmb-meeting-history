 19:05 <rafaeldtinoco> (sil2100: ill be +1 only if everybody else is)

 19:08 <sil2100> \o/

 19:08 <rafaeldtinoco> I have updated groovy and hirsute packagesets for openstack

 19:08 <rafaeldtinoco> (this will be done every cycle now, with openstack team helping)

 19:09 <sil2100> rafaeldtinoco: thanks!

 19:09 <teward> yay! glad to see we're making a lot of progress and the OpenStack team is going to work with us on this!  It'll probably help with all those SRUs I keep showing up in the sponsoring queue xD

 19:09 <rafaeldtinoco> my pleasure!

 19:09 <teward> nice.  So, the next item on the list then...

 19:09 <teward> ERR:LAG

 19:09 <teward> #topic Heads Up

 19:10 <teward> Just a heads up to you all: i was recently elected to the Community Council, while it doesn't affect my judgement here, it's something we should be aware of anyways :)

 19:10 <teward> until Mark says I can't, I'll have all the hats :P

 19:10 <teward> now onto ACTUAL work...

 19:10 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: wow, thats nice

 19:10 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: I was missing the council

 19:10 <rafaeldtinoco> glad you're there

 19:10 <oSoMoN> congrats teward

 19:11 <teward> myself and a few others are there, just wanted to make it known in case things start conflicting DMB/CC duties

 19:11 <ddstreet> congrats teward!

 19:11 <teward> in case I abstain from votes in the future more often that's probably why

 19:11 <sergiodj> congrats, teward!

 19:11 <teward> and thank you all.

 19:11 <sil2100> Congrats o/

 19:11 <teward> #subtopic teward elected to Community Council, notice to rest of DMB on that change in how it affects teward's votes

 19:11 <teward> now onto other business

 19:11 <teward> #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications

 19:12 <teward> we have two coredev applications today for consideration.

 19:12 <teward> #subtopic Olivier Tilloy (oSoMoN)

 19:12 <teward> oSoMoN: say hello and introduce yourself to us :)

 19:13 <oSoMoN> Hello, I'm Olivier, I work at Canonical on the Ubuntu Desktop team

 19:13 <oSoMoN> have been there for 3.5 years, and 10 years at Canonical in various teams

 19:13 <oSoMoN> In my time on the desktop team I've been increasingly resorting to sponsoring for package uploads and autopkgtest triggers, especially lately when I joined the +1 maintenance team, and that's the main reason for my application

 19:13 <oSoMoN> along with being a core dev always having been a sort of long-term goal in my involvement in Ubuntu

 19:14 <teward> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OlivierTilloy/CoreDevApplication

 19:14 <teward> (apparently that was never sent through... I blame LAG!)

 19:15 <oSoMoN> I was going to paste it

 19:15 <oSoMoN> thanks

 19:15 <teward> yep

 19:15 <rafaeldtinoco> im already there :o)

 19:15 <teward> i meant to do that shortly after my last message, but lagging hard on my side - borrowing parents' internet while my apartment is literally frozen (heater busted)

 19:16 <teward> thanks for introducing yourselv oSoMoN!  Any questions from DMB team members?

 19:16 * rafaeldtinoco reading application

 19:16 <sil2100> oSoMoN: quick question: when investigating a package FTBFS in the archive, what would you say might be the most frequent reasons?

 19:17 <oSoMoN> ah, there are many possible reasons :)

 19:17 <oSoMoN> it can be an arch-specific issue

 19:17 <sil2100> What possible causes come to your mind? List a few you had experienced

 19:17 <oSoMoN> or a toolchain update

 19:17 <oSoMoN> or a missing build dep

 19:18 <sil2100> Regarding missing build-deps, did you have a case before where a package FTBFS because of not being able to resolve a build-dependency even though that dependency is already in Ubuntu?

 19:19 <sil2100> Can something like that happen? And why?

 19:19 <oSoMoN> well yes in the past where build deps for packages in main needed to be in main too, but that requirement was relaxed a while back

 19:20 <oSoMoN> or the build dep is not available for all the architectures the package builds on

 19:20 <sil2100> That's what I wanted to hear, thanks o/

 19:22 <rafaeldtinoco> oSoMoN: I have seen that one of the things you list as objective is to do +1 maintenance without the need of being sponsored (which makes sense). Could you talk about the issues you have found ? What makes you pick one issue instead of other ?

 19:23 <oSoMoN> during the shifts I did, I focused quite a lot on the nodejs migration, which was a big hairy one, and that was motivated by it blocking firefox updates, which I maintain

 19:23 <oSoMoN> I also picked a bunch of packages at random to get out of my comfort zone

 19:24 <oSoMoN> having been explicitly told that I shouldn't use all of my +1 maintenance time to work on packages directly related to my daily work

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> thanks for saying that (that is where I was going)

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> I liked the nodejs annotation in the application page

 19:24 <oSoMoN> I also used popcon to get a sense of what popular packages might benefit from fixes

 19:28 <sil2100> No more questions from me

 19:28 <teward> if there are no more questions, then we can vote.  give me 2 seconds to grab the right meetingology command (I don't have it memorized LOL)

 19:33 <teward> cool cool

 19:33 <teward> #subtopic Sergio Durigan Junior

 19:33 <teward> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SergioDuriganJunior/CoreDevApplication

 19:33 <teward> sergiodj: say hello and introduce yourself!  :)

 19:34 <sergiodj> hey folks!  thanks for considering my application today.  I'm Sergio, I am part of the Ubuntu Server team at Canonical (therefore, I'm a Canonical employee ;-))

 19:34 <sergiodj> I am a Debian Developer, and have been a Debian contributor since 2014

 19:35 <sergiodj> as part of the Ubuntu Server team, I worked with several packages, mostly in main.  I also helped with +1 maintenance sometimes

 19:36 <sergiodj> I would like to become a CoreDev because I've been pestering my team (rafael included!) to sponsor packages for me

 19:36 <sergiodj> and also to retrigger autopkgtests ;)

 19:37 <sil2100> sergiodj: while working on Ubuntu packages, did you ever work on any transitions? Can you tell us what that is and how such things are handled?

 19:38 <sergiodj> sil2100: I have not worked on any transitions yet, but a transition is when you are going to upload a new version of a package which has the possibility of breaking reverse dependencies

 19:38 <sergiodj> for example, when there is a major soname bump

 19:38 <sergiodj> so we have to first request a transition slot to the release team, which will generate a new entry here: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/transitions/

 19:39 <sergiodj> from there, we have to work with the maintainers of the reverse deps of our package and make sure that they are updated in order to handle the new version of our package

 19:40 <sergiodj> of course, this can be as simple as rebuilding the reverse dep is uploaded, or can involve complex scenarios where you will have to do a major update in the revdep

 19:41 <sil2100> sergiodj: ok, thanks o/

 19:41 <sergiodj> interesting scenarios can occur when the revdep itself is a library (for example) and requires its own transition process

 19:41 <sergiodj> heh

 19:41 <sergiodj> sil2100: np!

 19:43 <teward> any more questions for sergiodj?

 19:43 <sil2100> sergiodj: another, less technical! You are applying for core-dev (which is very good!), but was wondering - what is the reason why you apply straight for core-dev and not for ubuntu-server PPU?

 19:45 <teward> #chair rafaeldtinoco sil2100 ddstreet teward

 19:45 <meetingology> Current chairs: ddstreet rafaeldtinoco sil2100 teward

 19:45 <teward> (for reasons intermally explained)

 19:45 <sergiodj> sil2100: I can cite a few things here.  the first one is that my whole team really encouraged me to apply straight to CoreDev, because (according to them) the quality of my work.  I can also mention the fact that my day-to-day work involves maintaining a lot of packages, so I'd have to file PPUs for several o fhtem

 19:45 <ddstreet> sergiodj i don't have any questions, but debuginfod sounds super interesting, i hope you can get that going with ubuntu packages, it would be extremely helpful; mapping coredump buildid back to a specific package version has been elusive for me so far

 19:45 <sergiodj> of them*

 19:46 <sergiodj> there's also the fact that, being a DD, I'm confident I can "hit the ground running" by being a CoreDev as well

 19:46 <sil2100> sergiodj: certainly having core-dev rights makes things much easier for general +1 maintenance! Ok, thanks!

 19:46 <sil2100> No further questions

 19:46 <sergiodj> ddstreet: thanks!  yeah, that's a very interesting project that is starting to attract a lot of attention!

 19:46 <sergiodj> I'm also excited by it :)

 19:48 <teward> any more questions from DMB members, or shall we vote?

 19:48 <ddstreet> nothing else from me

 19:51 <teward> #topic Any other business

 19:52 <teward> i got one

 19:52 <teward> #subtopic December Meetings

 19:52 <teward> The second meeting of the DMB in december is scheduled for December 28th, which falls on the weekend that happens *directly* after the 25th of December, which is Christmas Day.

 19:52 <teward> Meaning, 25, 26, 27, 28 technically fall on the Christmas weekend.

 19:53 <teward> do we want to skip that meeting given the timing of that holiday vs. the meeting itself?

 19:53 <rafaeldtinoco> I think it would be okay in skipping (as usually there are not many reqs during that time of the year)

 19:53 <rafaeldtinoco> and judging by our history of quorum lately

 19:54 <ddstreet> yeah i'm +1 to skip that one as well

 19:54 <teward> true.  I'm all for skipping the Dec. 28 meeting that'd normally ahppen (and will document on the Agenda) if we're in agreement.  myself, rafaeldtinoco, and ddstreet makes 3, sil2100 any objections?

 19:54 <teward> i know it's November but it's sometimes best to decide this stuff early ;)

 19:55 <rafaeldtinoco> nah its good (applicants have to know the future schedule as well)

 19:56 <rafaeldtinoco> sil2100: ^

 19:57 <teward> i mean, I could unilaterally make the call but I think it's best for us to agree on things, and I'm pretty sure nobody will object.

 19:57 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: if Lucasz is already gone, we can get his +1 on an email thread as well

 19:57 <teward> yep I'll bring it up but when I edit the agenda I'll mark it as 'tentatively agreed' and then update that once we get a solid vote.

 19:57 <rafaeldtinoco> sounds good
