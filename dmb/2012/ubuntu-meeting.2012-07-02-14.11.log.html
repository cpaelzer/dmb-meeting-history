<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">14:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers describes a requirement for "significant and sustained contributions" which is normally understood as 6 months
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">14:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> have you been developing on ubuntu for that long?
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">14:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vibhav&gt;</span> nope
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">14:20:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> were you aware of that requirement?

<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">14:20:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> I'm sorry that is not true
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">14:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> other membership boards have made it clear the "sustained requirements" period minimum
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">14:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micahg&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vibhav:</span> I told you about that in #ubuntu-motu

<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">14:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> I would just like to reiterate my comments that were also made at a precious Regional membership board meeting. I do not think vibhav is mature enough to be considered for Ubuntu membership. He lacks the necessary "team spirit" this community is built on. I strongly suggest his application be rejected until he can show more of the needed qualities. I am also concerned with the recent changes that were applied to the wiki page i.e comments
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">14:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> being removed.

<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">14:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> My pleasure.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">14:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Laney&gt;</span> I know that micahg put it back again.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">14:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Laney&gt;</span> I'm concerned about why you thought trying to hide it from us was appropriate.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">14:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vibhav&gt;</span> sorry
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">14:26:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Laney&gt;</span> We might have been able to have a discussion about the content of the comment, but that is now overshadowed by this, IMHO.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">14:26:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vibhav&gt;</span> I agree, that was really stupid of me
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">14:26:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> it's not the first time you've done it
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">14:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> yeah, one of the most important things I'm looking for in a prospective Ubuntu developer is trust from other developers
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">14:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> this whole telling lies thing is getting to be a real insult to the constant applications to the community
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">14:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Laney&gt;</span> I'm also very concerned that you have been to other membership boards and aren't following their advice.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">14:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vibhav:</span> part of being in a community is being able to accept criticism from your peers and learning from that criticism. Trying to hide it from the DMB was not only stupid, as you put it, but for me it shows a lack of trustworthiness.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">14:28:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vibhav&gt;</span> <span class="hi">IdleOne:</span> I was never trying to hide it
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">14:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vibhav:</span> I want you to know that I am probably obe of your biggest supporters. The Ubuntu ops team has had more than a few discussions about you.

<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">14:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Laney&gt;</span> ..
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">14:29:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vibhav:</span> then why remove it?
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">14:29:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> I am always trying to point out that you do have the potential but you don't want to do the work involved. This latest incident has really disappointed me.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">14:29:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IdleOne&gt;</span> Thanks to the DMB for letting me speak, sorry i took so much time.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">14:30:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> <span class="hi">IdleOne:</span> the "Things I can do better" paint a similar picture
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">14:30:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> I'm actually considering taking this to the CC
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">14:30:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tumbleweed&gt;</span> they are all part of "doing the work involved"
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">14:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ikonia&gt;</span> I don't find it acceptable that someone who is a persistant liar and trying to trick people into membership be allowed to continue
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">14:30:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vibhav&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tumbleweed:</span> Yeah, but I dont remember that stuff
