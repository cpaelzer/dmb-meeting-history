 16:18 <schopin> #startmeeting Developer Membership Board Meeting - 20250526

 16:18 <meetingology> Meeting started at 16:18:31 UTC.  The chair is schopin.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 16:18 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:19 <schopin> Just so that we have some semblance of form.

 16:20 <schopin> bdrung, rbasak: do you guys feel like you're up for judging aleasto's Contributing Dev application, with your respective current limitations?

 16:21 <schopin> Although aleasto I must warn you, under current DMB makeup having everyone present voting for you wouldn't get the quorum needed for the application to succeed.

 16:22 <aleasto> ok

 16:22 <bdrung> schopin, would it be enough when taking the votes via email into account?

 16:24 <schopin> Well, does Simon's vote count?

 16:25 <bdrung> I would say yes

 16:27 <bdrung> If I counted correctly there are +1 from two Simons. And aleasto would get one +1 from me. That would make +3 and not enough (would one more +1)

 16:27 <schopin> I'm honestly very tempted to just call it a day and move this back to the ML.

 16:28 <schopin> Robie seems busy, at least that way he wouldn't be rushed.

 16:30 <schopin> Alright, I'm ending this.

 16:31 <schopin> bdrung: would you mind voting on the ML thread as a way to kick it back alive?

 16:32 <bdrung> I agree. We are not enough to discuss the other topics on our agenda.

 16:32 <bdrung> schopin, okay, I'll answer the ML

 16:32 <aleasto> thanks

 16:32 <schopin> That's all, folks!
