 14:03:45 <micahg> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:04:11 <micahg> #subtopic Laney to start thread on ubuntu-devel about renaming UCD

 14:04:21 <Laney> O_O

 14:04:26 <Laney> clearly not done, sorry

 14:04:35 <Laney> do people care much about this?

 14:06:39 <Laney> ahem.

 14:06:41 <bdrung> Laney: it would be nice to have a better name, but there was no better one proposed yet

 14:06:48 <micahg> I don't think it's so bad, but I'd have to go back and look at the reason why we decided to change this in the first place

 14:07:07 <Laney> I don't want a tiresome bikeshedding thread for choosing a new name

 14:07:13 <bdrung> because it can be misinterpreted

 14:07:35 <Laney> I said we should use Ubuntu Development Members as that's in line with other stuff but some people didn't like that (I don't remember why)

 14:07:50 <bdrung> Laney: we should collect name suggestions and then discuss it here.

 14:08:13 <Laney> ok i'll start it soon then

 14:08:32 <micahg> Laney: thanks, carried forward then

 14:08:48 <micahg> #subtopic geser to e-mail the TB with the result of the poll

 14:09:00 <micahg> I believe this was done

 14:09:16 <Laney> yeah

 14:09:38 <micahg> #subtopic stgraber to add micahg to the mailing-list once TB has added him to the team

 14:09:43 <micahg> this was done as well

 14:09:57 <micahg> #subtopic jono to ask Daniel to update https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers to be easier to read

 14:10:22 <micahg> I think that the main membership page was updated, but not the Developers page yet

 14:10:52 <micahg> dholbach: is the above on your list?

 14:11:49 <micahg> well, carried forward until we can find out...

 14:12:01 <micahg> #subtopic cody-somerville to write some documentation on how to endorse someone

 14:12:42 <micahg> carried forward as Cody's not here

 14:12:59 <micahg> #subtopic stgraber to get the list of all package sets and their content somewhere online

 14:13:09 <stgraber> http://people.canonical.com/~stgraber/package_sets/

 14:13:16 <micahg> \o/

 14:13:24 <micahg> thanks stgraber

 14:13:29 <Laney> WOO!

 14:13:31 <dholbach> micahg, add to which mailing list?

 14:13:45 <micahg> dholbach: sorry, I meant on your to do list :)

 14:13:51 <dholbach> I didn't have time to look into https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers yet, but I'll bump the priority

 14:14:11 <micahg> dholbach: were you at least asked :)

 14:14:18 <Laney> can we have the team and packageset name in the reports?

 14:14:23 <dholbach> Jono indeed mentioned it to me

 14:14:30 <micahg> dholbach: excellent, thank you

 14:14:35 <Laney> team â†’ LP ID of uploader(s)

 14:16:01 <stgraber> Laney: package set name is the filename but I'm happy to add it to the report as well

 14:16:09 <Laney> cheers

 14:16:27 <micahg> stgraber: I think Laney is referring to the uploaders team

 14:16:31 <Laney> both

 14:16:42 <micahg> ah, heh, missed the first line :)

 14:16:44 <stgraber> Laney: I can expand the teams though probably won't do it recursively as it may take a while in some cases

 14:17:02 <Laney> I don't care about recursively, just the top-level entries

 14:17:29 <Laney> although I hope there will only be one of those ... :-)

 14:18:02 <bdrung> stgraber: can you put the generation script into a bzr branch under our hood?

 14:18:15 <micahg> well, top level of the teams should have multiple people hopefully

 14:18:34 <stgraber> bdrung: sure, I'll do that. What project should I use?

 14:18:52 <bdrung> good question. +junk?

 14:19:00 <stgraber> I guess that'd be a start :)

 14:20:07 <micahg> #action stgraber to publish packageset generation script so the rest of the DMB can help maintain it

 14:20:07 * meetingology stgraber to publish packageset generation script so the rest of the DMB can help maintain it

 14:20:32 <Laney> and get it auto deployed ;-)

 14:20:44 <Laney> bzr pull && ...

 14:20:49 <stgraber> yep

 14:20:56 <micahg> does that need a second action?

 14:21:02 <Laney> nah, I'm sure he can remember

 14:21:14 <micahg> ok, anythiing else about this script?

 14:21:17 <stgraber> indeed :)

 14:21:25 <bdrung> rule the world ;)

 14:21:51 <stgraber> updated script is running at the moment :)

 14:22:13 <Laney> we should link it from somewhere

 14:22:41 <stgraber> yeah, the developer membership wikipage would be a good candidate

 14:22:45 <Laney> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#Ubuntu_Developers_.28from_delegated_teams.29

 14:23:08 <bdrung> stgraber: Launchpad.login_with('testcase') -> better app name than testcase, please

 14:23:27 <Laney> can we do code review some other time?

 14:23:36 <stgraber> bdrung: looks like some copy/paste, will fix that :)

 14:23:47 <stgraber> Laney: sure

 14:23:51 <Laney> ty

 14:23:53 <micahg> ok, yes, let's debug the script later

 14:23:58 <micahg> moving on

 14:24:08 <micahg> #topic Administrative Matters

 14:24:24 <micahg> #subtopic Continue discussion on Ubuntu Developer Survey Report with jono

 14:25:01 <Laney> I guess we should have some TB involvement?

 14:25:38 <micahg> well, did we exhaust the subject ourselves or do we want a joint meeting before that?

 14:26:19 <micahg> or did you have something else in mind?

 14:26:40 <Laney> dunno, I just thought the idea was to have them involved

 14:27:17 <Laney> didn't see any reaction on the email from them though

 14:29:13 <micahg> well, perhaps we can discuss this further once the wiki gets updated to clarify the membership guidelines

 14:29:32 <Laney> i suppose the main issues were dealt with

 14:29:46 <micahg> right, it seems so

 14:30:28 <micahg> I'll leave this on the agenda and we can discuss with jono at the next meeting

 14:31:00 <micahg> #subtopic Continue discussion about our package set management workflows

 14:31:16 <micahg> I think we should wait to discuss this until the end as we can easily run out the clock with it

 14:31:32 <micahg> any objections?

 14:32:01 <bdrung> no

 14:32:02 <Laney> nah, go ahead

 14:32:08 <stgraber> sounds good

 14:32:14 <micahg> #topic PerPackageUploader Applications

 14:32:16 <Laney> as long as we do, because I know how I think it should work :-)

 14:32:57 <micahg> #subtopic cyphermox applying for PPU for usb-modeswitch*

 14:33:03 <micahg> cyphermox: are you around?

 14:33:07 <cyphermox> yup

 14:33:29 <micahg> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mtrudel/PPU-usbmodeswitch

 14:33:43 * micahg wonders if that worked...

 14:33:56 <cyphermox> IIRC you don't get ack for #link :)

 14:34:01 <micahg> cyphermox: can you please introduce yourself?

 14:34:07 <cyphermox> sure

 14:34:56 <cyphermox> I'm a developer working for Canonical on the Ubuntu Desktop team. My "official" task is to maintain NetworkManager, but I also usually touch other things such as evolution and generally interested in the networking stack

 14:35:19 <cyphermox> as such, usb-modeswitch is a clear dependency/important point, when you want to use 3G devices

 14:36:12 <cyphermox> at UDS-O we discussed porting the usb-modeswitch dispatcher script from Tcl to C which is what I've done, and a big part of why I'd like to be able to upload it directly

 14:36:44 <cyphermox> (just keeping up maintenance and porting changes to the upstream script to the C version)

 14:36:58 <Laney> do you anticipate having to maintain this patch in Ubuntu for long?

 14:37:31 <cyphermox> Laney: no. I've already spoken to the Debian maintainer and upstream author, the plan is to have both versions available from upstream

 14:38:15 <bdrung> cyphermox: why both? what drawbacks does the C version have?

 14:38:44 <cyphermox> bdrung: mainly the one of not being as editable by users directly; which is something upstream sees as important.

 14:39:10 <bdrung> sounds plausible

 14:39:35 <cyphermox> bdrung: my feeling is that it's mostly a matter of keeping it in a scripted language, I haven't really had other responses from upstream

 14:39:52 <Laney> can't you close bug 679256 now? :-)

 14:39:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 679256 in usb-modeswitch (Debian) "drop tcl/tclsh dependency" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/679256

 14:40:04 <cyphermox> yes, I can ;)

 14:40:20 * Laney has no real questions

 14:40:26 <Laney> thanks for getting the endorsers

 14:40:40 <Laney> oh, and please subscribe to bugs for -data

 14:40:49 <cyphermox> oh, indeed, good point

 14:41:03 <tumbleweed> cyphermox was very helpful when I ran into issues related to those packages, thiscycle

 14:41:08 <tumbleweed> (drive by endorsement)

 14:41:19 * bdrung has no questions.

 14:41:47 <micahg> cyphermox: I'm just curious about your response to what slangasek said on your app under Areas of Improvement

 14:42:39 * bdrung has only 30 mins left.

 14:43:26 <cyphermox> micahg: well, it's right, it was a dumb move, not sure what else to add :)

 14:44:01 <micahg> cyphermox: ok

 14:44:02 <stgraber> cyphermox: wasn't that related to the PATH from within udev being broken at some point (just remembered you mentioning something like that, so thought it could be related)

 14:44:48 <cyphermox> stgraber: well, it was based on the fact that it *could* be missing, but testing it proved it was available from udev when the script was called

 14:45:28 <stgraber> ok

 14:45:31 * stgraber is ready to vote

 14:45:54 <micahg> #vote cyphermox to gain PPU for usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data

 14:45:54 <meetingology> Please vote on: cyphermox to gain PPU for usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data

 14:48:34 <micahg> #subtopic James Page

 14:48:43 <micahg> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JamesPage/CoreDevApplication

 14:49:21 <micahg> jamespage: unfortunately, we only have 12 minutes before the next meeting, but we can see how far we get here

 14:49:31 <micahg> jamespage: please introduce yourself

 14:49:34 <jamespage> OK

 14:50:02 <jamespage> So my name is James Page and I work for Canonical as a member of the Ubuntu Server Platform team

 14:50:38 <jamespage> I have been contributing as a developer to Ubuntu for the last year; my contributions  have mainly been server related with a particular focus on Java.

 14:51:00 <jamespage> I already have upload permissions for the ubuntu-server packageset (June this year)

 14:52:06 <bdrung> jamespage: why do you want to become MOTU too?

 14:52:08 <jamespage> having a broader set of upload permissions would really help me work more effectively - and reduce the sponsorship burden I place on others at the moment

 14:52:46 <jamespage> bdrung: I would like to be recognised as MOTU as well I have a keen interest in helping ensure the quality of packages in universe

 14:53:04 <jamespage> most of the Java packages I have worked on are in universe

 14:53:25 <bdrung> jamespage: motu != universe. what have you done in the motu team?

 14:53:35 <jamespage> and I think having MOTU membership as well as core-dev recognises this contribtuion

 14:53:52 <micahg> jamespage: were you aware that core-dev membership includes membership in the MOTU team?

 14:54:02 <jamespage> micahg: yes I was

 14:54:35 <jamespage> bdrung: I have helped a few people on IRC (mainly pointing them in the right direction)

 14:55:24 <jamespage> note sure whether its directly related to MOTU but I also ran a UDW session - helping raise awareness of the Java packaging toolset

 14:56:20 <micahg> jamespage: your direct uploads appear to have ceased at the end of July, is there any reason for this?

 14:58:17 <jamespage> micahg: I think that reflects that I work outside of the server packageset that I have upload access to

 14:58:50 <jamespage> and the fact that eucalyptus moved out of the packageset; taking alot of java dep's with it

 14:59:34 <micahg> right, but what about the stuff in the package set, what happens to it, are you still keeping an eye on those packages?

 15:00:27 <micahg> or were the java packages your main focus in that packageset?

 15:00:57 <jamespage> I definately have more focus on the java packages in that packageset - but its not exclusive

 15:01:32 <micahg> ok, any more questions?

 15:01:35 <jamespage> I have a few contributions to the packaging of openstack (nova) - but we do that through a packaging branch

 15:01:48 <bdrung> micahg: no

 15:01:48 <jamespage> so it not always relected in my personal upload history

 15:02:33 <stgraber> I'm ready to vote

 15:02:46 <micahg> Laney: anything else?

 15:03:17 <Laney> got pulled away, sorry

 15:03:26 <micahg> we have 2 minutes....

 15:04:16 <micahg> Laney: any questions for jamespage or can we vote?

 15:04:40 <Laney> my only question is social and is in regard to the MOTU application

 15:04:54 <Laney> do you feel you are as involved with the MOTU community as you should be?

 15:05:04 <Laney> s/you/a MOTU/ :-)

 15:05:35 <jamespage> Laney: honestly - I feel I could be more involved

 15:06:10 <micahg> time's up...I guess we'll take this to the mailing list

 15:06:14 <Laney> thought so

 15:06:18 * Daviey raises pompom's for JamesPage.

 15:06:21 <Laney> I am ready to vote

 15:06:26 <Laney> if you still want to do it now

 15:06:42 <Daviey> micahg: If the others are ready to vote, couldn't it be achieved in meeting?

 15:06:42 <micahg> #vote jamespage to become core-dev (with social MOTU membership)

 15:09:12 <micahg> +0, I don't have any technical reservations, but just a question if there have been enough main uploads that belong outside the packageset of server (which I think is broken), I"ll have to discuss this later as I still need to do a review (tentative +1)

 15:11:05 <Laney> -1 Sorry, but I would really like to see more social involvement with the MOTU team before giving people upload rights which they technically already have. I'd really like to see you back here in a few weeks though.

 15:11:45 <micahg> Laney: would that be a +1 w/out core-dev?

 15:12:03 <micahg> bdrung: ?

 15:12:05 <bdrung> +0 core-dev gives you indirect motu membership. direct motu membership has a social component. (+1 without core-dev)

 15:12:05 <meetingology> +0 core-dev gives you indirect motu membership. direct motu membership has a social component. (+1 without core-dev) received from bdrung

 15:12:16 <Laney> erm, probably. I'd need to think about it.
