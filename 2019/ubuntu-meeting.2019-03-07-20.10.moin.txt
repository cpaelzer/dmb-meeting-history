 20:10 <nzoueidi> Hey people, welcome to the Membership Board Meeting

 20:10 <nzoueidi> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards.

 20:11 <nzoueidi> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting and while we have only frederik-f

 20:11 <nzoueidi> Then it is good and a quick meeting :D

 20:11 <frederik-f> :) cool

 20:11 <nzoueidi> frederik-f, you need to introduce themselves (1-5 sentences)

 20:12 <nzoueidi> and provide for us your wiki page link and the LP account

 20:12 <nzoueidi> #topic frederik-f

 20:12 <frederik-f> Okay! Hello, I am Frederik, living in Germany, working as java dev in my daily work, and contributed to the Yaru theme a lot

 20:12 <frederik-f> This is my wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrederikFeichtmeier

 20:13 <Wild_Man> frederik-f, how long have you been contributing?

 20:13 <frederik-f> My launchpad page is very empty and not very exiting because I contributed mainly on github, because that is where all the yaru stuff happens :(

 20:13 <frederik-f> I contribute since beginning of 2017 to yaru

 20:14 <Wild_Man> I looked at github and that is when I thought you started contributing just wanted to make sure

 20:14 <nzoueidi> and if there is anyone here that is supporting the application of frederik-f  to the Ubuntu Membership, please show up :D

 20:15 <frederik-f> This is my launchpad page, but is very empty: https://launchpad.net/~frederik-feichtmeier

 20:16 <frederik-f> My name is "Feichtmeier" on github

 20:16 <nzoueidi> I have some questions, why aren't you involved into the Germany LoCo team?

 20:17 <frederik-f> I actually do not know what it is :(

 20:17 <frederik-f> I started to contribute to the Ubuntu theme, because I thought they needed help back then when it started.

 20:17 <frederik-f> I can surely help, I will google what it is

 20:18 <nzoueidi> sure, np

 20:18 <nzoueidi> here is the link for the LoCo team in Germany: http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-de-locoteam/
