 16:09 <juliank> (done)

 16:09 <bdmurray> vorlon:

 16:10 <vorlon> * partially killing architectures is tedious

 16:10 <vorlon> * found and worked around a bug in the germinate handling that was wrongly pruning build-deps that we still needed

 16:10 <vorlon> * in response to the above ballooning the package set again, pruned opencv, gdcm, etc by changing gst-plugins-bad1.0 to not build a binary on i386 that isn't required for us

 16:10 <vorlon> * still eyeing the numpy package being in the set and considering more source changes to get rid of it

 16:10 <vorlon> * working through the list of autopkgtest regressions on i386 now that we're cross-testing (total test count reduced from 311 to 299 after the last germinate change)

 16:10 <xnox> Sheparded autopkgtest regressions blocking glibc and other uploads

 16:10 <xnox> Doing a few removals in debian to drop python2 things

 16:10 <xnox> This should make boost migratable soon* (debian removals pending before end of year)

 16:10 <xnox> Working on subiquity encryption UX with mwhudson

 16:10 <xnox> Working with snapd team on uc20 firstboot install

 16:11 <bdmurray> #topic Release incoming bugs

 16:11 <bdmurray> link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:12 <bdmurray> bug 1856059 is very new

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1856059 in jellyfish (Ubuntu) "jellyfish: please remove arm64, ppc64el binaries" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1856059

 16:12 <vorlon> that doesn't seem like it belongs on ff-incoming

 16:12 <vorlon> make sure ubuntu-archive is subscribed, move on?

 16:13 <bdmurray> Do we really need to card this or can somebody JFDI it?

 16:13 <bdmurray> ubuntu-archive is subscribed

 16:13 <bdmurray> I'll untag it

 16:13 <bdmurray> rls-ee is empty

 16:14 <bdmurray> rls-bb has nothing new

 16:14 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:14 <xnox> urgh

 16:14 <bdmurray> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:15 <cyphermox> fwiw cyrus-imapd will probably disappear shortly, I have just been looking at it

 16:19 <cyphermox> claiming libmoo-perl

 16:20 <vorlon> I will work on glibc with xnox

 16:21 <doko> I'll pick python-packaging,

 16:21 <vorlon> cyphermox for libmoo-perl (really cyrus-imapd)

 16:21 <bdmurray> I'll take apport

 16:21 <vorlon> bdmurray gets apport

 16:21 <vorlon> waveform: can you look at polib?

 16:21 <cyphermox> I'll take gawk given that it's cyrus-imapd

 16:21 <rbalint> i take curl

 16:22 <waveform> vorlon, okay

 16:22 <bdmurray> lets hold on there and start from the top

 16:22 <bdmurray> you still get what you took though

 16:22 <vorlon> doko: can you also take python-fixtures?

 16:23 <juliank> oh, the apt blocked by ... stuff I guess I can do some retries

 16:23 <tdaitx> bdmurray: why is apport even blocking stuff? update excuses points to 2.20.11-0ubuntu9 but we have 2.20.11-0ubuntu13 on focal for a while now

 16:23 <vorlon> if a package is a 'candidate' but stuck, look at https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_output.txt

 16:23 <doko> vorlon: no, this is all autopilot

 16:24 <vorlon> doko: and because of that you can't look at it?

 16:25 <vorlon> I'll take python-testtools

 16:25 <doko> that's autopilot as well

 16:25 <vorlon> doko: so?

 16:25 <vorlon> it still needs tdoing

 16:25 <doko> vorlon: do you work on autopilot removal?

 16:25 <juliank> I retried the python-apt triggered failures, seems they should have been fixed in the meantime

 16:26 <vorlon> doko: two archive admins are better than one for working on this

 16:26 <tdaitx> bdmurray: I requested autopktest retrys for apt and gdb so new apport will unblock them

 16:26 <vorlon> I expect it'll take several rounds

 16:26 <bdmurray> tdaitx: steal my work!

 16:26 <vorlon> doko: I'll let you have python-fixtures and python-testtools then

 16:26 <juliank> tdaitx: me too, for apt

 16:27 <vorlon> gawk, curl are claimed

 16:27 <vorlon> tdaitx: can you look at cmake?

 16:27 <juliank> makes me wonder if we have a fix for dropping duplicate requests in autopkgtest queue yet

 16:27 <tdaitx> vorlon: yeah

 16:27 <vorlon> juliank: psycopg2?

 16:27 <sil2100> juliank: no, Simon prepped a branch one time, I requested changes and I don't think it moved since then

 16:28 <doko> isn't that better handled by server team, psycopg2?

 16:28 <juliank> it would be, I guess

 16:28 <vorlon> it's listed as a foundations package

 16:28 <juliank> we can retry

 16:29 <juliank> let me try that

 16:29 <vorlon> juliank: ok you're on point for that

 16:29 <vorlon> apport/gdb is taken by bdmurray

 16:29 <vorlon> systemd/libseccomp: sil2100 ?

 16:29 <vorlon> cyphermox: can you also look at sudo? (cyrus-imapd, but also mediawiki)

 16:29 <rbalint> i take libseccomp

 16:29 <sil2100> vorlon: ok o/

 16:30 <rbalint> i think systemd 244 fixed it

 16:30 <vorlon> sil2100: ah, rbalint is fighting you for it

 16:30 <vorlon> sil2100: you can have libwww-perl isntead

 16:30 <sil2100> vorlon: aww, ok, fine as well ;)

 16:30 <sil2100> Let me card it then

 16:30 <tdaitx> so, cmake being blocked by ros-robot-state-publisher seems to be done, seb got it to pass 2 hours ago

 16:30 <vorlon> juliank: are you taking apt?

 16:30 <cyphermox> vorlon: ack, sudo

 16:30 <juliank> vorlon: Yeah

 16:30 <vorlon> ok

 16:31 <vorlon> netcat-openbsd: waveform: ?

 16:31 <juliank> vorlon: Those were temporary failures I think, so I just retried them too :)

 16:31 <waveform> vorlon, I can take a look

 16:31 <vorlon> doko: can you also take requests, or are you full?

 16:32 <vorlon> tdaitx: libdate-manip-perl

 16:32 <doko> I don't want to commit to that, but again, the oslo stuff is openstack ...

 16:32 <tdaitx> vorlon: ack

 16:32 <juliank> oh, if only we could grep all failures for postgres 11 and retry them

 16:32 <vorlon> anyone think they need more for this week?

 16:32 <vorlon> otherwise I would stop there

 16:32 <vorlon> juliank: download the artifacts tarballs and look for postgres?

 16:32 <rbalint> +1 for stopping :-)

 16:32 <doko> I'll look at python-meshio

 16:32 <juliank> well, yes it'd work

 16:33 <doko> vorlon: what about the packages with missing i386 builds, like binutils?

 16:33 <vorlon> doko: binutils should not be missing any i386 builds, it's in the whitelist

 16:33 <vorlon> what exactly are you referring to?

 16:33 <doko> ahh, no, failing atopkg test

 16:34 <xnox> can we remove packages from release, and allow new version to be stuck in proposed? ie. some debian packages are like that, due to e.g. automatic removal from testing

 16:34 <vorlon> xnox: demoting to proposed, instead of removing from proposed and release, has a non-negligible cost of clogging up proposed-migration reports

 16:34 <doko> if you can convince rm to override autopkg tests too ...

 16:35 <vorlon> doko: yes, I had overridden binutils autopkgtest for the version in release, I'll do the proposed version now as well

 16:35 <xnox> vorlon:  ack

 16:37 <vorlon> I think we're done with this topic

 16:37 <vorlon> bdmurray: ?

 16:38 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:39 <bdmurray> Anybody?

 16:39 <vorlon> nothing here

 16:39 <vorlon> I won't be at the next meeting, it's past my EOY :)

 16:40 <bdmurray> Okay then. Thanks everybody!

 16:40 <sil2100> Thanks!

 16:40 <tdaitx> thanks!

 16:40 <bdmurray> #endmeeting
