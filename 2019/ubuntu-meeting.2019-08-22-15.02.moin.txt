 15:10 <bdmurray> bug 1837934 has no importance

 15:11 <ubottu> bug 1837934 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "There is no warning to remove install media when rebooting" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1837934

 15:11 <cyphermox> I swear this shows up again every release

 15:11 <cyphermox> and we fix it every release

 15:12 <bdmurray> I thought it was the pressing enter does nothing bug that shows up all the time

 15:12 <vorlon> did we talk about this one last week?  finalrd?

 15:12 <cyphermox> well, pressing enter not working or the message not appearing at all, it's all finalrd-related

 15:13 <xnox> does plymouth reopen console.....

 15:13 <cyphermox> did we talk about this one in particular, I though it was something else last week

 15:13 <xnox> i guess i should look into ubiquity boot & shutdown

 15:13 <cyphermox> xnox: plymouth was doing the right thing before; this has to do with casper

 15:13 <cyphermox> probably some changes, and/or virtualbox being as useful as it usually is

 15:14 <cyphermox> (pressing enter / showing the prompt has always been an issue in virtualbox)

 15:14 <xnox> cyphermox:  well yeah, casper + live-build

 15:15 <xnox> cause i am thinking maybe the casper in eoan is at fault here (or well, my fault)

 15:15 <bdmurray> okay, we should card it right?

 15:15 <xnox> yes

 15:15 <bdmurray> I'll do so then.

 15:17 <cyphermox> ok, that's it for this one then?

 15:17 <bdmurray> for ee? yes

 15:17 <cyphermox> #topic Release incoming bugs (bionic)

 15:18 <cyphermox> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:18 <bdmurray> I ran across bug 1778684 the other day

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1778684 in man-db (Ubuntu) "man: command exited with status 4" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1778684

 15:19 <cyphermox> I guess it's kinda late to be looking at those, though

 15:19 <bdmurray> cyphermox: late? we can still SRU stuff

 15:20 <cyphermox> sure, late for the point -rlease I mean

 15:21 <bdmurray> lets go ahead and card that, it'll likely only need fixing for 18.04

 15:21 <cyphermox> ack

 15:22 <cyphermox> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:22 <cyphermox> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <bdmurray> xnox: did you look into the systemd SRU / KEY_RFKILL stuff?

 15:22 <cyphermox> mea culpa, still working on pyyaml, and libvpx is also still in progress

 15:22 <cyphermox> oops

 15:23 <bdmurray> bug 1740894

 15:23 <ubottu> bug 1740894 in OEM Priority Project bionic "KEY_RFKILL is not passed to userspace" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1740894

 15:24 <bdmurray> I thought you'd mentioned talking to somebody about that last week but I could be misremembering. Let's move on.

 15:26 <cyphermox> so; proposed migration

 15:27 <cyphermox> who was going to look at pandas?

 15:27 <vorlon> working on it

 15:27 <cyphermox> oh ok

 15:28 <cyphermox> libheif still MIR

 15:28 <vorlon> I have a new pandas in -proposed which drops python-pandas, but which also FTBFS for unrelated reasons

 15:28 <xnox> bdmurray:  thanks, will ping people about that now.

 15:28 <cyphermox> ok

 15:28 <xnox> vorlon:  pandas are bad!

 15:28 <vorlon> (it was ftbfs due to various build-dep changes before I started touching it)

 15:28 <vorlon> To: people@country.cn\nSubject: I think these are yours come fix them

 15:29 <cyphermox> debhelper when?

 15:29 <cyphermox> *then

 15:30 <vorlon> someone should volunteer

 15:30 <vorlon> someone who's not wrestling pandas

 15:31 <doko> I don't like wrestling, the winner is always known ... pandas ;)

 15:32 <vorlon> well I'm making progress, I've gotten down from 80,000 test failures due to new upstream pytest, to 3 test failures due to wtf

 15:33 <cyphermox> I'll do debhelper/plasma-framework

 15:33 <cyphermox> sqlite?

 15:33 <cyphermox> any takers for stuff in general, pls volunteer, kthxbai

 15:34 <vorlon> I think if there are no volunteers, the chair should pass them out

 15:34 <cyphermox> mmkay

 15:34 <cyphermox> glib2.0 is a maintained by both us and Desktop, no?

 15:35 <cyphermox> lsb: I recall xnox showed an interest in it previously

 15:35 <vorlon> almost all of these are going to be hunting down / hinting autopkgtest regressions

 15:35 <cyphermox> I'll do sqlite3, sphinx

 15:36 <cyphermox> openssh: doko wanna have a look?

 15:36 <vorlon> that's a test failure blocking glib2.0, should just be rolled into that one

 15:36 <cyphermox> alright

 15:36 <cyphermox> lxml: bdmurray?

 15:37 <vorlon> and yes, glib2.0 comaintained w/ desktop, so we should put somebody on it

 15:37 <cyphermox> yes

 15:37 <doko> cyphermox: I committed not doing any general distro work until EOY

 15:37 <bdmurray> cyphermox: okay

 15:38 <cyphermox> juliank: please look at python-setuptools

 15:38 <juliank> whoa

 15:38 <juliank> that shouldn't break like that

 15:39 <cyphermox> tdaitx: cmake and squashfs-tools, please

 15:39 <tdaitx> cyphermox: ack

 15:39 <cyphermox> tdaitx: think you can also do python-packaging?

 15:40 <juliank> fwiw, I feel like We should have autoremoval on regression for leaf packages

 15:40 <xnox> doko:  https://launchpadlibrarian.net/438541409/buildlog_ubuntu-eoan-amd64.systemd_240-6ubuntu11_BUILDING.txt.gz

 15:40 <seb128> cyphermox, vorlon, glib deprecated some api and the deprecation warnings in some libraries makes since unhappy, part of it is fixed in the new gnome/poppler stack waiting upload so I would wait for that to land before starting to debug those problems

 15:40 <tdaitx> cyphermox: yeah, I can take a look at it as well

 15:40 <seb128> makes *things* unhappy

 15:40 <cyphermox> seb128: thanks, you're chiming up at the right time, I was about to assign

 15:41 <cyphermox> seb128: keep us posted, and we'll help debugging?

 15:41 <xnox> doko:  https://launchpadlibrarian.net/438541409/buildlog_ubuntu-eoan-amd64.systemd_240-6ubuntu11_BUILDING.txt.gz

 15:41 <cyphermox> I think that's about it, we'll jsut needs to turn all this into cards now

 15:41 <seb128> cyphermox, sounds good, thx
