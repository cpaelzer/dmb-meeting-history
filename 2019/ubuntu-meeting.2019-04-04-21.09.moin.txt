 21:09 <wxl> #topic Chris Guiver

 21:10 <wxl> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting! The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 21:10 <wxl> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 21:10 <wxl> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 21:10 <wxl> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 21:10 <wxl> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 21:10 <wxl> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the majority of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 21:10 <wxl> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 21:10 <diddledan> oh you found the script :-)

 21:10 <wxl> yep. always improving :)

 21:11 <wxl> That said, Chris, fire away!

 21:11 <guiverc> wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/guiverc

 21:13 <guiverc> Hi, my name is Chris, first involved with Ubuntu with UWN (issue #425, July 2015) with 125 now contribs.  I'm a medically retired coder (s390/z-series now) with pain issues, so at times concentration is lacking..

 21:14 <wxl> Thanks for the intro, Chris!

 21:14 <wxl> Is anyone here in support of Chris?

 21:16 <guiverc> I haven't (& wouldn't) asked anyone - if that's were you're heading wxl

 21:16 <Kilos> wxl  you know Chris?

 21:16 <wxl> Ok, well just checking.

 21:18 <wxl> Kilos: yeah Chris has long been a heavy QA tester. Like across the entire gamut of flavors. He's also very good at writing and testing and updating bugs. It's hard not to see his name mentioned on Ask Ubuntu. More recently, he's been helping with Lubuntu and has been an utter Godsend. He's an all around great guy :)

 21:18 <Wild_Man> Chris does outstanding work for the UWN and has for several years now

 21:19 <Kilos> ty wxl  that alone eases my mind
