 13:05 <cpaelzer> We didn't have any that I remember - all was assigned

 13:05 <cpaelzer> anything I miss that was open from last week(s)?

 13:06 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 13:06 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:07 <cpaelzer> Three MIRs with security team ack

 13:07 <cpaelzer> there was one follow on which is tracked in the wider scope of mailman3 MIR-mania

 13:08 <cpaelzer> I will set all three bugs to "In Progress" per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MIRTeam#Process_states

 13:08 * jdstrand is here

 13:08 <cpaelzer> That is just the grinding on the long list of mailman3 bugs that will continue for a while

 13:08 <cpaelzer> hi jdstrand

 13:08 <jdstrand> hey

 13:08 <cpaelzer> I think we are done with new bugs then

 13:09 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 13:09 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:09 <cpaelzer> please also mention any other open questions that you might have asked or been asked

 13:09 <jdstrand> to that last point, yes, we are grinding. the list is bought up every week in our meeting and lots of people are assigned to various MIRs. it's just so many it'll take a while

 13:09 <jdstrand> brought*

 13:10 <cyphermox> yup

 13:11 <cpaelzer> jdstrand: that is fine

 13:11 <cpaelzer> it was no different to us for the filing and then MIR-team processing

 13:12 <cpaelzer> There is a doc collecting extra tasks at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfG79-Pq4G_Q0txNdwKZJBHnpOiKeMUhwdBrhYqbbwQ/edit

 13:12 <cpaelzer> internal only for now, but soon after initial discussion/clarification converted into public trello cards

 13:12 <cpaelzer> just FYI for you

 13:12 <cpaelzer> if more comes up in the security reviews this will be added the same way to the server teams task list

 13:13 <jdstrand> ack

 13:13 <cpaelzer> the list of incomplete bugs had no updates

 13:13 <cpaelzer> and nothing else was mentioned here

 13:13 <cpaelzer> so I guess no news

 13:13 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 13:14 <didrocks> nothing for me

 13:14 <cpaelzer> me neither
