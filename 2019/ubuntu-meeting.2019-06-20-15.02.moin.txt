 15:10 <cyphermox> #topic Release incoming bugs (eoan)

 15:10 <cyphermox> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ee-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:11 <bdmurray> So I see a bunch of ftbfs bugs in there but I thought we'd said they go straight to cards

 15:12 <bdmurray> vorlon: ^^

 15:12 <vorlon> ack, I'll card 'em now

 15:12 <bdmurray> Well it'd be nice if that step got done with the bug filing

 15:12 <bdmurray> bug 1832651

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1832651 in systemd (Ubuntu) "jackdbus fails to start: cannot allocate memory" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1832651

 15:13 <rbalint> bdmurray, i think we just card the ftbfs and pick them, but not at the meeting

 15:14 <bdmurray> rbalint: my point was when the ftbfs bug is filed a card should also be created

 15:14 <bdmurray> xnox: that's a systemd bug and I think there's an upstream fix

 15:15 <xnox> ok

 15:16 <xnox> bdmurray:  target

 15:17 <bdmurray> so all the undecided ones are ftbfs

 15:17 <cyphermox> grub2 is irrelevant, it's not going to be ftbfs when I'm done with it.

 15:17 <vorlon> indeed

 15:18 <cyphermox> actually, it is right now for me (I had exactly those issues), but that's what I'm fixing atm

 15:18 <cyphermox> (claiming)

 15:19 <vorlon> I'll fix up the rest

 15:19 <bdmurray> cyphermox: I forget what did we say about bug 1706859?

 15:19 <ubottu> bug 1706859 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Bionic) "Auto-selected keyboard layout no longer matches chosen region on "Where are you" page" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1706859

 15:20 <cyphermox> I think I said I was going to test it, figure out if it's indeed what I think, picking language in ubiquity screens vs. in gfxboot

 15:20 <cyphermox> (so, preseeding)

 15:20 <bdmurray> that sounds familiar

 15:20 <bdmurray> so we leave that pending testing

 15:21 <bdmurray> bug 1783597 has a question about revising minimum installation space for preinstalled snaps

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1783597 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "The disk-space-needed estimate doesn't account for the snaps" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1783597

 15:21 <cyphermox> yeah

 15:21 <cyphermox> that one was because there's an open question whether we should also revisit minimum space hints in installers

 15:21 <bdmurray> vorlon: Do you think we should just bump the space needed or maybe check to see if we should?

 15:21 <bdmurray> e.g. do a minimum install and see what happens

 15:22 <vorlon> probably the latter

 15:22 <bdmurray> okay, I'll test that

 15:23 <bdmurray> I think that's good for rls-ee bugs

 15:23 <cyphermox> #topic Release incoming bugs (bionic)

 15:23 <cyphermox> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:23 <cyphermox> one bug in that list

 15:23 <rbalint> how can we tell the needed space for snaps in advance when there are debs pulling in snaps in postinst?

 15:24 <vorlon> that's not how our images should be configured; snaps should be getting directly seeded

 15:25 <juliank> should we add an extra fields to debs?

 15:25 <rbalint> juliank, that could work

 15:26 <rbalint> like extra space needed for the package

 15:26 <juliank> XB-Extra-Install-Size: <kb>

 15:26 <rbalint> this could also be useful for other dynamic data

 15:26 <juliank> It might also be a useful estimate for packages that might create huge files

 15:26 <juliank> or flash installer or stuff

 15:26 <rbalint> :-D

 15:27 <rbalint> juliank, seems we agree :-)

 15:28 <juliank> ack

 15:28 * juliank speaks with his crazy APT maintainer hat

 15:34 <cyphermox> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1509717

 15:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1509717 in lvm2 (Ubuntu) "Wily LVM-RAID1 â€“ md: personality for level 1 is not loaded" [High,In progress]

 15:34 <bdmurray> So old

 15:34 <cyphermox> ^ bb incoming bug

 15:36 <gaughen> I see it's assigned to apw

 15:37 <gaughen> is this something foundations should look to address?  do we agree that now we have comment #7 should we do it?

 15:37 <cyphermox> so; tracking or not?

 15:37 <gaughen> so xnox it's an sru of lvm2?

 15:37 <cyphermox> xnox: are you volunteering for it?

 15:38 <xnox> cyphermox:  no, enotime

 15:38 <xnox> i can do it in august

 15:38 <cyphermox> ack

 15:38 <vorlon> but it's a small change

 15:38 <vorlon> it's just a little wafer

 15:38 <bdmurray> so let's track and card that then

 15:38 <vorlon> ok I'll do

 15:39 <bdmurray> and unassign Andy

 15:39 <cyphermox> ok; moving on then

 15:39 <cyphermox> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:39 <xnox> vorlon:  btw, should i sru openssl postinst fix for people who purged debconf database?

 15:39 <cyphermox> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:40 <xnox> vorlon:  or just push openssl to security, and let everyone explode?!

 15:40 <vorlon> xnox: you mean fix the .templates?

 15:40 <vorlon> there is no postinst change required

 15:40 <gaughen> xnox, vorlon let's chat more about this one when we get to AOB

 15:40 <vorlon> and yes it should be fixed

 15:40 <gaughen> apt is blocked on apt

 15:41 <gaughen> juliank is on it

 15:41 <juliank> upstream apt maintainer me will be doing a new release soon

 15:42 <juliank> also python-apt update is needed, see https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/transitions/html/apt.html

 15:42 <juliank> also could someone remove debian-xcontrol, aptsh, and goplay from eoan? thanks!

 15:43 <juliank> (I filed bugs they are listed in #u-release somewhere)

 15:44 <cyphermox> ok; that's it then?

 15:44 <cyphermox> #topic Chair selection for next meeting

 15:44 <cyphermox> who's the victim?

 15:44 <bdmurray> Is AOB after chair?

 15:44 <cyphermox> yes

 15:45 <rbalint> cyphermox, shuf? :-)

 15:45 <cyphermox> I nominate sil2100 because he's not here to defend himself?

 15:45 <cyphermox> (that's what I did, shuf)

 15:45 <juliank> +1

 15:45 <bdmurray> +1

 15:45 <xnox> seconded

 15:45 <rbalint> +seconded

 15:45 <cyphermox> shuf is going to be fair but not fun though; if you happen to be unlucky

 15:46 <cyphermox> ok, sil2100 is next chair, or we'll figure out something

 15:46 <cyphermox> #topic AOB

 15:46 <juliank> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

 15:46 <cyphermox> that's a good song!

 15:47 <bdmurray> cyphermox: You are out on Monday right?

 15:48 <cyphermox> yes, I'm out for the next two Mondays

 15:48 <juliank> JFTR: I'm not here - I'm out today and tomorrow

 15:48 <juliank> All I did today was wash my bicycle

 15:48 <cyphermox> bdmurray: but, hey, Mondays are the worst

 15:48 <cyphermox> and now I want lasagna

 15:49 <cyphermox> any other other business?

 15:49 <juliank> end of aob

 15:49 <vorlon> nothing else here

 15:50 <cyphermox> winnitude!
