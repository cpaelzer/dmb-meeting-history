 13:08 <cpaelzer> as of a minute ago this list had one entry

 13:08 <cpaelzer> but that was just a security ack with a bad status

 13:08 <cpaelzer> I fixed it up

 13:09 <cpaelzer> nothing else in the list

 13:09 <didrocks> \o/

 13:09 <cpaelzer> hi didrocks

 13:09 <didrocks> hey cpaelzer :)

 13:09 <cpaelzer> I revieed one myself last week and since the list is empty it seems you got whatever else came up as well

 13:09 <cpaelzer> any other NEW MIRs active or incoming that we should know of?

 13:10 <didrocks> nothing special. I'll have one, but it's scheduled for August, so we have time

 13:10 <cyphermox> o/

 13:10 <cpaelzer> hi cyphermox

 13:10 <cyphermox> sorry, I was in deep hack mode

 13:10 <cpaelzer> sure - we all know "the zone" welcome cyphermox

 13:11 <cpaelzer> nothing new to distribute among us then

 13:11 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 13:11 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 13:12 <cpaelzer> last update on this list was 14th of June for openjpeg2

 13:12 <cpaelzer> nothing really new

 13:12 <cpaelzer> anything on this list one of you wants to discuss?

 13:12 <doko> no

 13:13 <didrocks> nothing either

 13:13 <cpaelzer> ok - that seems like none overall - at least have one topic for the next section :-)

 13:13 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 13:13 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: 3 weeks agoyou were so kind to take https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/probert/+bug/1830347

 13:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1830347 in probert (Ubuntu) "[MIR] probert as dependency of curtin" [Undecided,In progress]

 13:13 <cpaelzer> since then it is assigned to you

 13:13 <cpaelzer> I'm assuming you got swamped by other things

 13:14 <cpaelzer> but begging your pardon I wanted to poll on an update on this ?

 13:16 <cpaelzer> ... cyphermox seems to be fallen into hack-mode again ? ... oO

 13:19 <doko> are we finished?

 13:20 <cpaelzer> well I waited for cyphermox to answer

 13:20 <cpaelzer> but he can give his answer later, I'm just relying on geting any status update on it

 13:21 <cpaelzer> doko: I think we can close the meering

 13:21 <cpaelzer> umm, meeting

 13:21 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: pelase answer late ronce available

 13:21 <cpaelzer> it seems random character movement day for me again :-/
