 15:07 <tdaitx> * openjdk-11 bionic security transition

 15:07 <tdaitx> - gtk3 tests, backporting upstream fixes, looking for more fixes to backport and other bug reports, sadly gtk3 is currently still worse off then gtk2

 15:07 <tdaitx> - rebuild openjdk with gtk3 fixes, then with gtk2 as default

 15:07 <tdaitx> - uploaded new openjdk

 15:08 <waveform> * Pi classic first-boot specification (k/b+display, serial, and net)

 15:08 <waveform> * Tested seeding cloud-init (inc. networking config) from boot partition of raspi image (re: net first-boot); tracing where partitions are named in livecd-rootfs

 15:08 <waveform> * Worked on getting CM3+ to boot: armhf and arm64 working; turns out it just needs up-to-date firmware blobs (current device-trees are acceptable)

 15:08 <waveform> * Added newer firmwares to linux-firmware-raspi2; need to check with sil2100 this is done correctly (new version, etc.)

 15:08 <waveform> * Stripped out hacks from linux-firmware-raspi2 after raspi-sync discussion re: cloud-init networking config

 15:08 <waveform> * Attempted (rather lamely) to aid doko with some arm-related python debugging (nearly there!)

 15:08 <waveform> (done)

 15:09 <rbalint> infinity is not online

 15:09 <rbalint> cyphermox:

 15:09 <cyphermox> I think you have a bug there

 15:10 <rbalint> i mean sil2100 is out too

 15:10 <rbalint> juliank:

 15:11 <rbalint> (done)

 15:11 <rbalint> any questions about the status?

 15:11 <gaughen> I have one

 15:12 <gaughen> tdaitx, doko - so what's left to do for openjdk11 in Bionic?

 15:12 <rbalint> doko: i'm adding an autopkgtest to u-u to test upgrading everything to -proposed

 15:12 <rbalint> that covers openjdk11 packages in proposed now

 15:13 <doko> gaughen: looking at openjfx, and looking at unattended-upgrades

 15:13 <tdaitx> gaughen: u-u for bionic and cosmic, checking gtk3 support on openjfx

 15:13 <doko> gaughen, tdaitx: I asked rbalint to do that

 15:14 <doko> and I think I  copied openjdk-lts to -proposed without waiting for the armhf binaries :-/

 15:14 <doko> I'll need to sort that out ...

 15:15 <gaughen> doko, tdaitx should I setup a sync for Monday?

 15:16 <tdaitx> gaughen: I think so, steve was out this week, so could be a good way to get back to it

 15:16 <gaughen> cool, will do

 15:16 <doko> gaughen: I'm at a conference, so probably not ...

 15:16 <gaughen> well I'll get sbeattie and tdaitx together

 15:17 <rbalint> #topic Release incoming bugs (bionic)

 15:17 <rbalint> #topic Release incoming bugs (disco)

 15:17 <rbalint> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-dd-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1821869? should we just target that doko?

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1821869 in python3.7 (Ubuntu) "bus error in test_gil test on armhf with 64bit kernel" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821869

 15:18 <doko> bdmurray: no

 15:18 <bdmurray> doko: what is the tag for?

 15:19 <doko> it says rls-dd-incoming, not assign-to-doko, or what did I read wrong?

 15:19 <doko> anyway, if you would have read the status ... waveform is looking at that

 15:19 <bdmurray> when I said target I meant target it to the release not to doko

 15:20 <bdmurray> waveform: if you are looking at it perhaps you should be assigned?

 15:21 <waveform> okay - I'm just putting together something with more space to test it (having run out on the CM :)

 15:22 <bdmurray> okay, I'l target it and assign it

 15:22 <gaughen> wait

 15:22 <gaughen> so we're wanting to fix this for disco?

 15:23 <bdmurray> I believe so

 15:23 <gaughen> k

 15:23 <bdmurray> then bug 1821412

 15:23 <ubottu> bug 1821412 in update-notifier (Ubuntu) ""System program problem" report button does nothing" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821412

 15:28 <rbalint> sounds important to fix but we can sru that later

 15:28 <bdmurray> yeah, that's ture

 15:28 <gaughen> so we don't think this one is release critical?

 15:28 <bdmurray> er, true and it may need SRU'ing to an older release

 15:28 <gaughen> bdmurray, so let's get it in the queue for early in EE and then SRU

 15:29 <bdmurray> Is it worth getting this fixed on the Disco image?

 15:29 <bdmurray> I guess that's the real question.

 15:29 <bdmurray> and I'd say no, so EE

 15:30 <bdmurray> then that leaves bug 1822044 which is also High

 15:30 <ubottu> bug 1822044 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Laptop freezes after installation is finished when pressing "Restart Now"" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1822044

 15:32 <rbalint> i think this shoule be fixed, but probably not in our packages

 15:32 <bdmurray> right, the restart now issues are never ubiquity

 15:34 <rbalint> withot nouveau it seems to work

 15:34 <bdmurray> this is recent hardware and is certified so seems important for DD

 15:36 <gaughen> bdmurray, I just poked bjf about this bug

 15:36 <gaughen> bdmurray, do you want to retarget it at something not-ubiquity?

 15:37 <bdmurray> gaughen: will do

 15:37 <gaughen> so one more thing on the first one - the python one - who will pick that one up?

 15:38 <bdmurray> gaughen: I thought waveform is

 15:38 <waveform> yup

 15:38 <gaughen> ah cool, thanks waveform

 15:38 <doko> Bug 1821350

 15:38 <ubottu> bug 1821350 in linux (Ubuntu) "Lenovo X1: failing to resume from suspend after closing the lid" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821350

 15:40 <gaughen> what about bug 1809920

 15:41 <ubottu> bug 1809920 in update-manager (Ubuntu Xenial) "prompt to upgrade to 18.04 shows while upgrade to 16.04 is still in progress" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1809920

 15:41 <bdmurray> there needs to be another release to upgrade to for that to happen

 15:41 <bdmurray> so if people are upgrading to disco, e won't be available yet so its not critical for fixing

 15:41 <rbalint> +1

 15:45 <bdmurray> maybe we should test that and see what happens if click yes during the existing upgrade

 15:46 <bdmurray> I'll go ahead and test this

 15:46 <bdmurray> so how about bug 1795477

 15:46 <ubottu> bug 1795477 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "ubuntu-release-upgrader crashed with ValueError: could not convert string to float: '0,0000'" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1795477

 15:47 <juliank> woohoo

 15:47 <bdmurray> is that a localization issue?

 15:47 <rbalint> imo this should be fixed

 15:47 <rbalint> most likely l19n

 15:47 <juliank> python-apt bug

 15:47 <rbalint> l18n :-)

 15:47 <juliank> well apt bug; this was supposed to be fixed

 15:47 <rbalint> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:47 <rbalint> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:48 <bdmurray> juliank: when was it supposed to be fixed

 15:48 <juliank> years ago I remember that problem from then

 15:48 <bdmurray> actually the last report is from 1/26/2019 in the Error Tracker

 15:49 <bdmurray> but that's not years ago! ;-)

 15:52 <juliank> summary: this was fixed in xenial's apt 1.2.16 (nov 2016), but the people never upgraded to that before upgrading to bionic

 15:52 <gaughen> xnox was going to look at fuse next week

 15:52 <gaughen> python-numpty is the next one

 15:53 <doko> numpy

 15:53 <gaughen> python-numpy is the next one

 15:53 <doko> graham inggs asked several times including rationale to ignore that one. He never got a reply ...

 15:54 <doko> ... and not for the first time

 15:54 <gaughen> doko, where did he ask?

 15:55 <doko> #u-r

 15:56 <doko> this is a waste of time, here, and for the community contributors

 15:56 <gaughen> so I'm not sure what to do with this one

 15:56 <gaughen> gdb

 15:56 <doko> there's nothing with gdb

 15:56 <doko> archive is frozen for the beta

 15:57 <gaughen> k

 15:57 <gaughen> doko, anything else on the list we should talk about?

 15:58 <doko> gaughen: yes, things like lintian and cross-toolchain-base-mipsen

 15:59 <doko> these all time out, and the runtime varies for some reason.  this is known, but nobody makes any progress on these

 15:59 <doko> e.g. I gave back lintian/armhf until it succeeded

 16:00 <doko> does anybody want to drive that with the release team?

 16:00 * doko looks at the vacuum of volunteers

 16:00 <cyphermox> shouldn't we try to get to the bottom of it a different way? is this timing out reproducible when running autopkgtests manually?

 16:01 <rbalint> cyphermox, i think there are just a lot of tests

 16:01 <doko> yes, when I'm doing some other work on my machine

 16:01 <cyphermox> rbalint: lots of tests is no good reason to timeout

 16:01 <doko> so lintian is sequential

 16:01 <cyphermox> rbalint: netplan has a ton of tests, they run one after the other, some of them take >60 seconds to run, etc.

 16:02 <doko> c-t-b is a normal build using all the cpu's on the machine

 16:02 <cyphermox> c-t-b?

 16:02 <doko> c-t-b-m

 16:02 <doko> cross-toolchain-base-mipsen

 16:02 <cyphermox> ah

 16:03 <rbalint> i pick lintian

 16:03 <gaughen> thanks rbalint

 16:04 <rbalint> anythong else from the queue?

 16:05 <rbalint> #topic AOB

 16:06 * doko is away next week at Linaro Connect, only working half day on distro stuff

 16:08 <gaughen> 19.04 Final Freeze is two weeks from today

 16:08 <gaughen> that's all I have to say Balint

 16:08 <gaughen> rbalint,

 16:08 <gaughen> +1 to closing the mtg

 16:08 <rbalint> happy hacking the next weeks then, lets roll out an awsome Disco! :-)

 16:08 <rbalint> awesome

 16:09 <rbalint> #endmeeting
