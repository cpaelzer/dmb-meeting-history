 15:03 <cyphermox> #startmeeting Ubuntu Developer Membership Board

 15:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Mon Dec 16 15:03:21 2019 UTC.  The chair is cyphermox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:03 <meetingology> 

 15:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:03 <cyphermox> welcome welcome :)

 15:04 <cyphermox> #topic review of previous action items

 15:04 <cyphermox> I think we'll call this a carry-over as things aren't complete AFAICT, and many of the board are currently half-there, busy, etc.

 15:04 <rbasak> +1

 15:04 <cyphermox> fwiw my tasks for elections are carry-over, but we'll need to start nominations nowish

 15:05 <cyphermox> probably carry them on under first or second week of January so we have time to have nominees even though there are the holidays

 15:05 <cyphermox> That also covers the next point being, elections for the 2 expiring members (me and jbicha)

 15:05 <cyphermox> also, I do not plan on re-running, unless there is no nomination

 15:06 <cyphermox> that is, I'll gladly give my seat to somebody else if there are volunteers so we can have new people contributing too :)

 15:06 <cyphermox> #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications

 15:06 <cyphermox> #subtopic Sahid Orentino Ferdjaoui

 15:07 <cyphermox> sahid, around?

 15:07 <rbasak> Looks like he postponed until January?

 15:07 <cyphermox> oh did I misread the date?

 15:07 <cyphermox> ah yes

 15:07 <cyphermox> oops

 15:07 <cyphermox> ok, next topic then

 15:08 <cyphermox> #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications

 15:08 <cyphermox> #subtopic rafaeltinoco

 15:08 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/rafaeldtinoco/CoreDev

 15:08 <rafaeldtinoco> o/

 15:08 <cyphermox> rafaeldtinoco: please introduce yourself

 15:09 <rafaeldtinoco> I'm a Software Engineer, member of Canonical, in the Server Team since May 2019. I'm also former Sustaining Engineer at SEG team, where I worked for 4 years. In the Sustaining Engineering Team I was also the tech lead for all "userland" related bugs (and UA cases), not only working with bugs in specific areas, but also guiding new engineers in the next steps in their bugs/cases. I have also worked in several kernel

 15:09 <rafaeldtinoco> related bugs regarding KVM, scheduling, memory management, block devices and SCSI protocol & transport. Nowadays I'm focused in starting good HA related software maintainership, helping out engineers in charge of virtualization AND debugging/fixing bugs for all useful packages for Ubuntu Server.

 15:10 <rafaeldtinoco> I used to use Slackware in the beginning, but the fact that I had to rely on an external tool to deal with .tgz packages (slackpkg) that had almost no relationship among them took me to Debian really quickly. After Ubuntu arrived, moving to Ubuntu, because of its better Desktop experience initially, was quite automatic for me. Of course we all had the Gentoo experience, but after nights and nights recompiling X11 because

 15:10 <rafaeldtinoco> of different compilation flags, or just because of new dependencies versions, make us re-think this "let me compile everything approach". That also goes for OpenBSD ports, and the incredible attempt of making NetBSD pkgsrc to behave like a Linux distro packaging system (I really tried to stay with compiled only packages in NetBSD). My experience with RHEL and CentOS was mainly targeted to enterprise customers using it,

 15:10 <rafaeldtinoco> and not for fun and/or development purposes. Because of the "enterprise" type jobs, I was never much into the contributing-to-public-projects before working @ Canonical (SEG team), something I regret. All the work I can give as a reference starts at that time, but I think it is enough to show how I have already contributed to Ubuntu project and how I can, even more, help the project in the future.

 15:10 <rafaeldtinoco> </introduction>

 15:18 <cyphermox> do DMB members have questions for rafaeldtinoco ?

 15:21 <rbasak> No questions from me. Rafael is a colleague on my team, so I'll do my normal half-recusement and vote only to make up quorum if everyone else is unanimous.

 15:22 <cyphermox> mmkay

 15:22 <cyphermox> rafaeldtinoco: so, what are the next steps for pcs, and what of ocfs2-tools?

 15:23 <rbasak> I should add that I'd intended to endorse Rafael's application but have failed at that.

 15:24 <rafaeldtinoco> cyphermox: when merging ocfs2-tools last cycle we realized s390x architecture was bad (there was a segfault for one of the userland tools)

 15:24 <rafaeldtinoco> migration was done by hand at last moments and, during this cycle, in a new merge with debian, I whitelisted all little endian architectures as the upstream project maintainer confirmed that big endian architecture was an issue

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> instructed by xnox, I then opened a RM bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ocfs2-tools/+bug/1855720

 15:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1855720 in ocfs2-tools (Ubuntu) "RM ocfs2-tools s390x binary packages from Focal" [Medium,New]

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> asking for the s390x binary package to be removed so migration can continue

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> (as excuses page complains about missing build package for s390 for the last upload)

 15:25 <rafaeldtinoco> for pcs, we're trying to make it a "default" cluster configuration tool.. but it is very rhel/centos targeted

 15:26 <rafaeldtinoco> and we've spoken to openstack team also trying to check if that would cause an issue with existing charms (as they rely on crmsh).

 15:26 <rafaeldtinoco> currently pcs is blocked on migration because of snmp as there was a autopkgtest dependency on a newer version

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> so I asked ahasenack (since he got the merge card for snmp) if I could help him out and I've done the snmp merge

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> currently being discussed here:

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> https://code.launchpad.net/~rafaeldtinoco/ubuntu/+source/net-snmp/+git/net-snmp/+merge/376795

 15:27 <rafaeldtinoco> I need a few DEP3 changes based on christians review, but it will be done today, and unblock pcs migration also

 15:28 <rafaeldtinoco> I think thats it

 15:34 <cyphermox> I fail to understand why a snmp test would need a newer version of net-snmp, but whatever

 15:35 <cyphermox> I don't have other questions

 15:35 <cyphermox> DMB members ready to vote?

 15:35 <cyphermox> #voters sil2100 rbasak slashd micahg cyphermox

 15:38 <rbasak> sil2100 and slashd left proxy votes if they weren't around

 15:38 <rbasak> I guess they're not here, so I'll relay their votes

 15:38 <rbasak> slashd voted +1

 15:38 <rbasak> sil2100 voted +1

 15:39 <rbasak> If all votes today are unanimously +1, I will also vote +1 to make quorum

 15:39 <rbasak> That leaves just cyphermox I think?

 15:41 <cyphermox> +0, I'm not comfortable issuing my vote given that I've again expired and that we're past due for elections

 15:41 <meetingology> +0, I'm not comfortable issuing my vote given that I've again expired and that we're past due for elections received from cyphermox

 15:41 <rbasak> Then we aren't quorate I guess :(

 15:46 <cyphermox> I'm giving a few minutes; I thought micahg had mentioned maybe he could be there again in the future; and maybe tsimonq2 will see this

 15:54 <cyphermox> ok, no response

 15:54 <cyphermox> #endvote

 15:54 <cyphermox> ^ hey, good job meetingology

 15:54 <cyphermox> maybe let's take this to email?

 15:55 <cyphermox> #topic any other business?

 15:57 <cyphermox> I'll take it as a no; and I certainly don't have AOB myself (aside from what I mentioned earlier in the meeting)

 15:57 <cyphermox> re. restaffing the DMB

 15:58 <cyphermox> #endmeeting
