 15:14 <vorlon> great

 15:14 <vorlon> any questions?

 15:15 <vorlon> #topic Release incoming bugs (disco)

 15:15 <vorlon> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-dd-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:15 <vorlon> bdmurray: ?

 15:15 <bdmurray> bug 1821677 was tagged by doko and but it was on 4/1

 15:15 <ubottu> bug 1821677 in glibc (Ubuntu) "dl_open segment fault in ubuntu18.10 glibc2.28" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821677

 15:15 <vorlon> I see there's a new bug reporting a segfault in a glic we're not shipping

 15:16 <infinity> Hrm?

 15:16 <doko> I got a ping from upstream about that, didn't look at that in detail

 15:16 <vorlon> from upstream of what?

 15:16 <doko> glibc

 15:16 <doko> glibc/intel

 15:16 <infinity> "not shipping"?

 15:16 <xnox> desktop team?

 15:16 <vorlon> infinity: the bug report says 2.28

 15:17 <infinity> Which is in cosmic.

 15:17 <vorlon> but it's been marked dd-incoming

 15:17 <vorlon> is it also reproducible in disco?

 15:17 <infinity> That would be doko.

 15:18 <infinity> I'll have a look at that today/tomorrow (doctor/etc premitting today) before I do the disco upload.

 15:18 <vorlon> infinity: so you think we should commit to fixing it in disco?

 15:18 <vorlon> (I can't reproduce it here on either cosmic or disco)

 15:19 <infinity> Can't reproduce with their test case?

 15:19 <infinity> Well, that might make it harder. :P

 15:19 <infinity> I was committing to look, not to fix if I can't repro.

 15:19 <vorlon> infinity: I'm not using their so, which I don't see attached

 15:19 <vorlon> maybe it's in this tarball

 15:19 <vorlon> anyway, I guess we can tentatively commit and uncommit later

 15:19 * infinity nods.

 15:20 <vorlon> ok, targeting

 15:20 <vorlon> bdmurray: next?

 15:20 <infinity> make: *** [Makefile:10: runtest] Segmentation fault (core dumped)

 15:20 <infinity> Seems to repro here.

 15:20 <vorlon> ok

 15:20 <bdmurray> bug 1820676

 15:20 <ubottu> bug 1820676 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Something has gone seriously wrong: import_mok_state0 failed" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1820676

 15:21 <vorlon> infinity: (I was trying to repro from the bug description, not the attached tarall)

 15:21 <vorlon> b

 15:21 <infinity> Might have been a mismerge of that patch, or just needs more ifdef arm.

 15:22 <doko> I can confirm this one, renaming the exe helped

 15:22 <vorlon> cyphermox: ^^ is that not fixed in the disco dailies?

 15:22 <vorlon> related to missing mmx64

 15:22 <cyphermox> it was fixed not long ago

 15:22 <vorlon> was it fixed after 3/18? :)

 15:22 <cyphermox> checking

 15:23 <infinity> Would have been right around then.

 15:23 <vorlon> bdmurray: let us follow up on that, it's probably fixed

 15:23 <cyphermox> 3/20

 15:23 <infinity> Cause the images weren't getting the new d-i bits due to a hung build on nusakan.

 15:25 <cyphermox> spot checking on cdimage.u.c shows that ubuntu-mate and ubuntu dailies have the file

 15:25 <infinity> Yeah, they all should now.

 15:25 <bdmurray> that's all I noticed in dd-incoming

 15:25 <cyphermox> yup

 15:25 <vorlon> yeah I've followed up on the bug

 15:26 <vorlon> I'm not bothering to target to disco because if there is a bug, it's probably not in a package in the archive

 15:26 <vorlon> anyway I will follow through

 15:26 <vorlon> bdmurray: what aout LP: #1815599 and LP: #1812688 that are on the report?

 15:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1815599 in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems "multipath shows '#:#:#:#' for iscsi device after error injection" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1815599

 15:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1812688 in automake-1.16 (Ubuntu) "self-check-report.sh fails on armhf/disco, was set to skip as an ubuntu delta without explanation" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1812688

 15:27 <bdmurray> the multipath one is incomplete, has it been updated?

 15:27 <vorlon> xnox nominated the first

 15:27 <vorlon> no

 15:27 <vorlon> so I guess we can ignore

 15:27 <vorlon> the other one, I tried to close and seb128 called me on it because I didn't read bdmurray's previous comment right

 15:27 <xnox> vorlon, the multipath one was handindled by cpaelzer a bit

 15:28 <vorlon> bdmurray: I think we should decline LP: #1812688, if we were willing to override the test to ignore the failure, it must not be critical enough to block a release

 15:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1812688 in automake-1.16 (Ubuntu) "self-check-report.sh fails on armhf/disco, was set to skip as an ubuntu delta without explanation" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1812688

 15:29 <bdmurray> vorlon: okay

 15:29 <vorlon> done

 15:29 <vorlon> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:29 <vorlon> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:30 <bdmurray> I'm looking at apport

 15:30 <vorlon> xnox: fuse-zip status?

 15:30 <doko> g inggs pinged several times about scipy

 15:30 <vorlon> I see you merged a new upstream version of fuse-zip, so that it can now fail its tests consistently on all archs

 15:31 <infinity> vorlon, doko: Should cross-toolchain-base-whatever be addded to huge packages in autopkgtest, or should the massively massive (with hugeness) rebuild test maybe be pared down?

 15:31 <vorlon> doko: I know he pinged me while I was on vacation and not in a position to do anything with it.  If someone has a clear rationale for ignoring that test failure, MPs welcome

 15:31 <xnox> vorlon, didn't get to it, but also not critical to migrate as far as i remember. yes which is an "improvement" =) my next trick was going to be to cherrypick fuse patch from upstream, or comment out / ignore the test that doesn't do the right clean up.

 15:31 <xnox> vorlon, skipping one test, makes it all pass locally.

 15:31 <cyphermox> infinity: +1, I think?

 15:32 <xnox> (the test that tries to setup invalid/broken state, and assert on it)

 15:32 <cyphermox> cross-toolchain-base-mipsen?

 15:32 <doko> infinity: it's building exactly *one* cross toolchain. you could reduce the load further by not building the multilibs

 15:32 <xnox> not sure what i should do about fuse-zip. horum.

 15:32 * xnox tries to trow things into bileto ppa, to make it stick.

 15:32 <doko> but vorlon wanted to look why it takes so much longer in some builds

 15:32 <vorlon> xnox: "not critical to migrate" - someone in this channel uplodaed fuse with the intent that it release, and you committed to resolve this

 15:33 <doko> xnox: should we remove fuse & fuse-zip from -proposed?

 15:33 <vorlon> xnox: so if you're following up, all good

 15:33 <xnox> vorlon, yes, and when i questioned why fuse was synced post debian import freeze no reply followed. doko - do you recall why we need/want new fuse?

 15:33 <xnox> vorlon, but kind of can kicking, removing fuse now from -proposed will just come back in a couple of weeks.

 15:34 <doko> I forgot, it was something to fulfill b-d's probably

 15:34 <xnox> and well needs to be folved now, or later.

 15:34 <xnox> doko, ah, and now they are built, we don't need it anymore, right ?! =)))))))) har har

 15:34 <vorlon> we wouldn't know, since we can't launch new rebuild tests

 15:34 <xnox> =)

 15:35 <gaughen> vorlon, lies.  ;-)

 15:35 <vorlon> heh

 15:37 <gaughen> so what are we doing with fuse?

 15:37 <gaughen> removing it?

 15:37 <infinity> Removing it is pointless.

 15:37 <gaughen> so what are we doing with fuse?

 15:38 <vorlon> infinity, doko: cross-toolchain-base: the issue was the variance in build times, which doko pointed to as an indicator of a problem in the autopkgtest infra; but I don't think giving it a bigger testbed prevents us from still doing that analysis

 15:38 <vorlon> gaughen: xnox has a list of next steps for getting it migratable

 15:38 <gaughen> k

 15:38 <vorlon> and sphinx is still there

 15:38 <xnox> vorlon, que?

 15:40 <xnox> is it only me that gets very choppy audio

 15:40 <xnox> vorlon, i can't hear you at all...

 15:41 <waveform> xnox, audio's fine for me

 15:42 <vorlon> xnox: sphinx, my recollection is that you were going to follow up on #ubuntu-release to sort out what to do about sphinx vs webkit2gtk, and I don't think that happened

 15:43 <xnox> vorlon, we did talk about it with the desktop team, but i can't remember if we conclude something or not.

 15:49 <vorlon> xnox: I didn't see a conclusion and it didn't get fixed in the archive :)

 15:49 <vorlon> xnox: shall we try again to take this to #ubuntu-release after this meeting? ;)

 15:49 <xnox> hm.

 15:52 <vorlon> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:54 <rbalint> i'd like to have LP: #1821924 rc

 15:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1821924 in lxd (Ubuntu) "LXD Deb->snap transition fails in WSL due to snap command not working (yet)" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1821924

 15:54 <rbalint> because it breaks do-release-upgrade which is ours

 15:55 <rbalint> lxd is not maintained by our team, but release team could weigh in

 15:55 <bdmurray> is rc a verb there?

 15:55 <rbalint> release critical

 15:55 <infinity> release criticalified

 15:55 <bdmurray> rc'ed then

 15:56 <rbalint> ok :-)

 15:56 <infinity> Inappropriate apostrophe alert.

 15:57 <rbalint> any comment on the actual bug?

 16:01 <vorlon> so, since snaps don't work under wsl, should the lxd deb be removed as part of the upgrade?

 16:03 <bdmurray> don't we do that with gnome-calculator and other desktop packages?

 16:03 <xnox> vorlon, i think that's valid, at least for now. at the moment the new .deb fails to configure, blocking upgrade.

 16:03 <xnox> vorlon, and it may happen on non-wsl systems too.

 16:04 <xnox> vorlon, imho the error code path on snapd-less systems when doing do-release-upgrade is currently very bad.

 16:04 <vorlon> it sounds like this is something we need to take offline
