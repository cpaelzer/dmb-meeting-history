 17:01 <mhall119> sladen: you are the only one to have something on the agenda, so I hope you're around

 17:02 <mhall119> this will not be the CC/KC meeting that we are trying to schedule, too many people from both teams were not going to be available, we will try and get that scheduled for next week at a convenient day and time for everybody

 17:03 <mhall119> but if you wanted to talk about any of the other things you put on the agenda, we can do that now

 17:07 <mhall119> I guess sladen isn't here, so we will postpone his agenda items for a later date

 17:07 <mhall119> is there any other business that anybody would like to bring up?

 17:10 <mhall119> I'm going to end it then, if anybody comes along in the next 50 minutes please ping me and I can start it up again
