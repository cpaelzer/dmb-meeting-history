 22:04 <elacheche_anis> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting! The wiki page for

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> the Review Board is available here:

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up

 22:04 <elacheche_anis> where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> (FIFO). Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> needed, ask the applicant further questions. During this time it is

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> vote

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> #topic DS-McGuire

 22:05 <elacheche_anis> DS-McGuire, please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 22:05 <DS-McGuire> My name is Daniel McGuire, I am 20 years old and I study software engineering at Cardiff Metropolitan University in Wales. I have tried to become a major player in the Ubuntu community over past last year and I see myself in the future using the skills I learn both in and out of Uni to help develop the Ubuntu operating system. My main focuses are design and development of software, at the moment since I am not the best with

 22:05 <DS-McGuire> programming, I am sticking mostly to design until I can get better skills.

 22:07 * ahoneybun is 22

 22:07 <elacheche_anis> Any questions for DS-McGuire? Any supporters here?

 22:07 <ahoneybun> o/

 22:07 * cm-t I have to d/c because métro will close, But I will just say DS-McGuire is very friendly guy, I just opened a group on telegram with the topic of ubuntu/apps and he already launched a topic for a design icon

 22:08 <DS-McGuire> :)

 22:08 <elacheche_anis> Good cm-t :) ahoneybun if you have a question go ahead and ask it :)

 22:08 <ahoneybun> supporter

 22:08 <toddy> DS-McGuire: Do you has contact (real-life) to your loco group in wales?

 22:08 <cm-t> gn8 guys thank you

 22:08 <ahoneybun> DS-McGuire, do you see yourself helping other devs with UI and icon designs?

 22:08 <Kilos> TY cm-t

 22:08 <Kilos> eish caps lock

 22:09 <elacheche_anis> #voters Kilos elacheche_anis toddy ahoneybun wxl cwayne popey

 22:09 <meetingology> Current voters: Kilos ahoneybun cwayne elacheche_anis popey toddy wxl

 22:09 <cwayne> DS-McGuire: do you anticipate becoming more active in the development side as well? (as you get better skills)

 22:09 <DS-McGuire> toddy, I have yet to meet with the loco group in my area, this is because of traveling to and from the place they meet since I cannot afford it. I am planning on going to the next Ubuntu-fr meeting if I can afford that.

 22:10 <cwayne> and if so, what type of development?  specifically apps? or other parts of the OS too?

 22:10 <DS-McGuire> ahoneybun, Yes. That is one area I want to be a major player in.

 22:10 <Kilos> DS-McGuire  is there a loco in wales?

 22:11 <DS-McGuire> cwayne, Yes, albeit I find the community very intimidating because of its professionalism however I do see myself contributing directly to Ubuntu/Unity 8 in the next few years.

 22:11 <Kilos> ah

 22:11 <hggdh> elacheche_anis: can I be a voter as well?

 22:12 <DS-McGuire> apps are focus for me since I do plan to make a living from them and the Ubuntu 8 operating system gives me an amazing platform to develop on.

 22:12 <cwayne> hm, that sounds like something we need to fix, we dont want anyone to ever be intimidated to contribute

 22:12 <elacheche_anis> #voters hggdh

 22:12 <meetingology> Current voters: Kilos ahoneybun cwayne elacheche_anis hggdh popey toddy wxl

 22:12 <hggdh> \o/

 22:12 <elacheche_anis> my fault hggdh :)

 22:12 <wxl> indeed cwayne

 22:13 <wxl> DS-McGuire: you find the ubuntu community intimidating?

 22:13 <DS-McGuire> cwayne, Oh not in a bad way. And not by anyone being an a**. It's just looks it when you're a novice hahah!

 22:13 <Kilos> yes we can speak to them, everyone should feel welcome in their own loco as well

 22:13 <hggdh> DS-McGuire: heh. It helps to keep in mind that we all started as novices

 22:14 <DS-McGuire> hggdh, I understand that. :)

 22:14 <wxl> i have found the ubuntu community totally welcoming. even the most "professional" folks are just as willing to help as the most "amateur"

 22:14 <cwayne> yeah, well I'm glad its not people being jerks at least :)

 22:14 <Kilos> yeah

 22:14 <wxl> esp. in dev

 22:14 <ahoneybun> agreed

 22:14 <DS-McGuire> It's not the fact people are not welcoming, it's quite the opposite, I assure you. However I don't want to look like I don't know what I am doing haha!

 22:14 <cwayne> DS-McGuire: I totally get what you're saying (I felt the same at first), but that's the beauty of this community, everyone's there to help, not criticize :)

 22:14 <wxl> exactly

 22:14 <DS-McGuire> cwayne, Definitely :)

 22:15 <wxl> not knowing things is an opportunity to get to know

 22:15 <cwayne> DS-McGuire: ha, I still don't know what Im doing :P

 22:15 <wxl> heh

 22:15 <wxl> ditto!
