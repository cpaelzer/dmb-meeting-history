 16:07 <jamespage> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:07 <jamespage> caribou is not around - but probably worth noting we have a haproxy SRU regression inflight - haproxy in trusty can't tell whether its running any longer

 16:08 <jamespage> fix awaiting acceptance into proposed, but that is breaking ha deployments of openstack right now on icehouse.

 16:08 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:08 <jamespage> matsubara, anything from you?

 16:08 <matsubara> jamespage, no news from me this week

 16:08 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:08 <smb> No news except that due to the coming end of the year there will be even less news in near future...

 16:08 <jamespage> \o/

 16:09 <jamespage> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:09 <jamespage> anything? FOSDEM is late Jan - anyone submitted talks?

 16:09 <jamespage> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:09 <jamespage> Christmas!

 16:09 <jamespage> awesome

 16:10 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 16:10 <jamespage> anyone else got anything else to discuss?

 16:10 <teward> hiya!

 16:10 <jamespage> hey teward

 16:10 <teward> nginx 1.9.6 is likely going to finally land as part of a merge now, though without HTTP/2 due to security team mandates currently in place

 16:11 <teward> and i expect some headaches from users testing Xenial already hoping for that feature

 16:11 <jamespage> glad to hear that - what are the limitaions with enabling http/2 ?

 16:11 <teward> jamespage: security team concerns over the implementatio

 16:11 <teward> n

 16:11 <teward> blah

 16:11 <teward> implementation*

 16:11 <jamespage> so tricky to get through MIR right now?

 16:11 <teward> sarnold is the one who sent the mandate down to me, watching -server and such for my noting to rbasak the merge was being worked on today

 16:11 <jamespage> teward: ack - thanks for the update!

 16:12 <teward> jamespage: i'd poke the Sec team with that question, AIUI they want it to go through some more 'world use'

 16:12 <teward> so it's less 'fuzzy' (it's still being developed after all)

 16:12 <jamespage> teward: I guess implemented != ready for production use...

 16:12 <teward> note Apache has a similar mandate against it, confirmed by sarnold

 16:12 <jamespage> okies

 16:12 <teward> jamespage: nginx upstream says it 'is usable' but security team has their own concerns

 16:12 <teward> and while I understand them, the merge delta is increased

 16:13 <jamespage> teward: do you need support from anyone in the wider team around nginx?

 16:13 <teward> jamespage: just a sanity-check of my latest debdiff.  and $50 in retroactive funding for the coffee I needed.

 16:13 <teward> my note here was for situational awareness more than call for support

 16:13 <jamespage> teward: lol

 16:13 <jamespage> ok

 16:13 <jamespage> anyone else for open discussion elements?

 16:14 <jamespage> teward: btw that was an appropriate topic to raise in "Xenial development" IMHO

 16:14 <teward> jamespage: i was late

 16:14 <teward> :)

 16:14 <jamespage> hehe

 16:14 <jamespage> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:14 <teward> not my fault wifi here blew up

 16:14 <teward> (will remember for future)

 16:14 <jamespage> I'd suggest we adjorn for two weeks and start off the new year with a server team meeting on the 5th of January

 16:15 <jamespage> so have a nice christmas and new year everyone!

 16:15 <jamespage> 1600 UTC 5th January 2016
