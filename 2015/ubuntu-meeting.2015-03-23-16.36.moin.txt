 16:36 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:36 <tyhicks> jdstrand: You're up

 16:37 <jdstrand> I was happy last week to finally get the frameworks rfc to the snappy list

 16:37 <jdstrand> I'll be nailing that down this week

 16:37 <jdstrand> also working with mvo, et al on seccomp in the snappy launcher

 16:38 <jdstrand> we also defined the snappy security yamllast week, so updating docs/trello cards for that

 16:38 <jdstrand> beyond snappy I have one embargoed item

 16:38 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:39 <mdeslaur> hey!

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:39 <mdeslaur> and I have a few updates that I'm currently testing

 16:39 <mdeslaur> I should be publishing them this afternoon or tomorrow morning

 16:39 <mdeslaur> after that, I've got more in the pipeline

 16:39 <mdeslaur> that's about it

 16:39 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up!

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:40 <sbeattie> I've got some apparmor patch review to do as well as pulling in fixes to the apparmor package

 16:40 <sbeattie> I need to continue testing my gcc-5 pie-on-amd64 packages

 16:41 <sbeattie> that's pretty much it for me

 16:41 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:41 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:42 <tyhicks> Wrap up security review of the python-bcrypt MIR (LP: #1427861)

 16:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1427861 in python-bcrypt (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-bcrypt (b-d of python-django)" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1427861

 16:42 <tyhicks> Review the initial snappy launcher code

 16:42 <tyhicks> Land the libapparmor policy cache API changes

 16:42 <tyhicks> (a few more patches need to be reviewed but I think they're all from jjohansen and are ones that I can review/ack)

 16:43 <tyhicks> Restart work on AppArmor kernel keyring mediation for user data encryption

 16:43 <tyhicks> Finish up the patches to fix bug #1430532 and send them out for review

 16:43 <ubottu> bug 1430532 in AppArmor "libapparmor needs a public function to break a context into a label and mode" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1430532

 16:43 <tyhicks> Embargoed item

 16:44 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:44 <tyhicks> jj is out

 16:44 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:45 <sarnold> I'm on community this week

 16:46 <sarnold> I'm working on the backlog of openstack security fixes, I've made less progress than I had hoped with the serverstack testing framework, but wow is it nice to run a few commands and ahve two dozen machines come into existence and do my bidding

 16:46 <tyhicks> nice

 16:46 <sarnold> my first plan for specifying per-service package sources didn't work out, the updated packages weren't being installed, but beis ner suggested a small change that seems likely to succeed

 16:47 <sarnold> I'm also repsonding to some last-minute MIR questions, it'd be nice to get all the needed ones moved forward for everyone, but that would probably require openstack to behave a bit more friendly for me.

 16:48 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> Hi :)

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> This week, I plan to finish https://code.launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/oxide/arale-fixes and get it merged in to trunk. It's running ok at the moment, and appears to fix the crashing. I've also found some future opportunities for optimising the new compositing path too

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I also plan to make a start on bug 1428754

 16:49 <ubottu> bug 1428754 in Oxide "Persist permission request decisions for a session" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1428754

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> Which will mean no more popup every single time you go to Google on the phone

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> And it's also needed to unblock https://code.launchpad.net/~zaspire/oxide/web-notifications/+merge/251598

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 16:54 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: Thanks for taking time out of your weekend to prepare, test, and publish the firefox updates

 16:54 <chrisccoulson> sure, no problem :)

 16:54 <tyhicks> :)
