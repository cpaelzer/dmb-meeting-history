 22:04 <ahoneybun> #topic Seth Johnson

 22:04 <ahoneybun> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 22:04 <sethj> I don't get to wear my sword? awwww

 22:04 <Kilos> haha

 22:04 * george_e puts down his sword too

 22:04 <ahoneybun> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 22:05 <ahoneybun> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:05 <ahoneybun> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:05 <ahoneybun> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:05 <ahoneybun> LP: https://launchpad.net/~sethj

 22:05 <ahoneybun> Seth: please introduce yourself to the board

 22:06 <sethj> Hi, I'm Seth. I've been using Ubuntu since 11.04, although I had a live CD of 9.10 that I used for occasional tinkering before that.

 22:06 <sethj> My first introduction to the Ubuntu community was Ask Ubuntu, which I joined in early 2012, just before 12.04 iirc. In 2014 I was elected as an AU moderator.

 22:06 <sethj> Over time my work on Ask Ubuntu introduced me to the wider aspects of the community, how it worked, how it was organized, and how I could contribute. Since then I've done a little of (almost) everything: bug work, Q/A, a little dev work, some packaging, and (obviously) support.

 22:07 <sethj> and that has cumulated (so far) in this meeting :)

 22:07 <ahoneybun> super cool :)

 22:07 <Kilos> nice work sethj

 22:07 <ahoneybun> Any questions for Seth? Any supporters here?

 22:08 <toddy> sethj: which of your Ubuntu work do you love most and why?

 22:08 <george_e> I am here for Seth.

 22:08 <george_e> I am also supposed to give a shout out from jokerdino who couldn't make it here.

 22:08 <ahoneybun> awesome thanks george_e

 22:08 <sethj> toddy, ouch! Hard question. I was thinking about that before the meeting and I couldn't come to any conclusion. I love it all!

 22:08 <toddy> sethj: fine

 22:08 <elacheche_anis> that's good thing sethj

 22:08 <sethj> I guess my work on AU is what I enjoy most. I lets me interact with awesome people every day.

 22:09 * ahoneybun is a bit biased to LoCo

 22:09 <sethj> most (barely)*

 22:09 <sethj> Most of the other stuff I have done has been a little more on the loner side. Not quite so much interaction.

 22:13 <teward> crap i'm late, am I too late to say sethj is a wonderful asset to the community? :P

 22:13 <ahoneybun> nope

 22:13 <ahoneybun> :)

 22:13 <george_e> teward, I don't think so.

 22:13 <Kilos> too late

 22:13 <Kilos> haha

 22:14 <ahoneybun> I mean there is no timer on this

 22:14 <toddy> I am ready to vote

 22:14 <elacheche_anis> I'm ready to vote too :)

 22:14 <sethj> thanks teward, george_e :)

 22:14 <ahoneybun> popey: or wxl want to ask anything since I messed up?

 22:15 <popey> just reading up about sethj, sorry.

 22:15 <elacheche_anis> tyt popey we wait :)

 22:15 <wxl> sethj: i did want to offer my assistance with testing, bug management, and locos. so get in touch later on!

 22:16 <popey> Was looking at launchpad.. saw a few bug comments on the bug scrub, thanks for getting involved in that sethj !

 22:16 <sethj> wxl, That'd be awesome!

 22:16 <popey> Then I clicked your askubuntu page. No brainer, you're exactly our kind of person!

 22:16 <popey> I have no questions :)

 22:16 <teward> well then let me put my two cents in then about sethj.  Seth is a great asset to the community, and strives to help all types of users, technical or newbies, with support and information and knowledge.  He's been putting feelers out into the bug world for some time, asking questions and such if he's unsure, but I think he's a wonderful asset to the community.  I fully support him, as a community member, in his hunt for membership status.  :)

 22:16 <teward> (I never had a chance to edit his wiki for that testimonial, my apologies to the membership board)

 22:16 <wxl> sethj: i'm head of qa for lubuntu and on the loco-council so i have a bit of experience ;) feel free to email me or find me somewhere on irc and we can have a chat/pm

 22:17 <Kilos> np teward
