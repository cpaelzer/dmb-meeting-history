 22:08 <s-fox> #startmeeting

 22:08 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Feb  5 22:08:30 2015 UTC.  The chair is s-fox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:08 <meetingology> 

 22:08 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 22:08 <Kilos> hehe had to move usb to another socket

 22:08 <s-fox> #topic Membership 22:00 UTC Board Meeting

 22:10 <s-fox> Okay, sorry for the delay everyone. Due to a lack of board members the final vote will be taken to our mailing list.  We will contact people with results though. Apologies in advance, We realise that this is not ideal

 22:10 <Kilos> np

 22:10 <superfly> Thanks

 22:10 <s-fox> The first candidate is  Kilos , please introduce yourself

 22:10 <cwayne> how many people are we missing?

 22:10 <s-fox> 1

 22:11 <Kilos> must i wait?

 22:11 <s-fox> No,  Please go ahead Kilos :)

 22:11 <Kilos> My name is Miles Sharpe,I joined the launchpad team in September 2009. My wiki page is at  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kilos

 22:11 <Kilos> I started using Ubuntu on 8.10 and really struggled until Superfly invited me to #ubuntu-za (when he found me struggling on the main ubuntu mailing list) and there I was taught how to think in a new way. Actually taught to think again. Was basically running on subconscious memories before

 22:12 <Kilos> We have often joked about me being the greeter bot on #ubuntu-za

 22:12 <Kilos> I joined the launchpad team in September 2009. My wiki page is at  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kilos. My future goals are to keep being the greeter bot in #ubuntu-za , helping newbies as far as I can then pointing them to more knowledgable help when I'm stumped and reporting bugs when I find them

 22:12 <s-fox> Wow, so many testimonials! :D

 22:12 <Kilos> I am also planning to reach out to other Ubuntu groups in Africa with the intention of helping them to start their own Locos. I have had reply from the Congo Brazzavile so far and they are keen to do so. 20 members

 22:13 <Kilos> Africa's northern point measured from Tunisia to most southern point in Cape Town is a total distance: 7,965.97 km with some countries only having one or 2 Ubuntu users. I have created an IRC channel #ubuntu-africa so hopefully the single users have a community to connect with.

 22:14 <Kilos> People from 9 different countries have already joined the channel since creating it on Wednesday, 4 February 2015

 22:14 <Kilos> thats me guys

 22:14 <inetpro> well done Kilos

 22:14 <Kilos> ty inetpro

 22:15 <s-fox> Is anyone here to support Kilos ?

 22:15 <Kilos> was nerve wracking

 22:15 <s-fox> Relax, we don't bite. Haha

 22:15 <Kilos> haha

 22:15 <superfly> me

 22:15 <Kilos> this is a big thing for me

 22:15 <inetpro> s-fox: if I can I would like to add something

 22:15 <s-fox> Go for it inetpro

 22:15 <Neo31> i'm here to support Kilos even tough I know him only for few days now :)

 22:15 <inetpro> I think the barriers of entry in the Linux world are very low and especially so with the Ubuntu OS and the value is very high, and not just monetary value, but the value is even higher for those who can not possibly afford anything else. Most people unfortunately just don't know it.

 22:16 <inetpro> for the guys who do not know Kilos, do yourself a favour to find out more about him

 22:16 <Neo31> he seems honest and loves ubuntu and very helpful on irc

 22:16 <inetpro> he is the ultimate example of why Ubuntu with it's OS based on free software just has to keep going!

 22:16 <inetpro> he has proven, to me at least, how anyone no matter your standing in society, whether rich or poor, whether you're a developer or a normal user or even a mechanic, can play a massive role in the Ubuntu community

 22:16 <inetpro> his character and perseverance also reveals the true spirit of Ubuntu! "People are people through other people"

 22:16 <inetpro> ..

 22:17 <superfly> Yes, I echo what inetpro says.

 22:17 <s-fox> This is wonderful to see :)

 22:17 <cwayne> Excellent :)

 22:20 <s-fox> Okay, next up is superfly

 22:20 <Neo31> congrats Kilos :)

 22:20 <superfly> Hi!

 22:20 <s-fox> Please introduce yourself

 22:20 <superfly> My name is Raoul Snyman, I'm a developer and open source advocate. My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/superfly

 22:21 <superfly> I started using Ubuntu when it first came out (I remember the picture controversy ;-) ), and soon started hanging out in the South Africa LoCo IRC channel (October 2006). Even though I'd been on the list and in IRC for a while, I didn't get to joining the team on Launchpad until later.

 22:21 <superfly> I'm the leader of an open source project, OpenLP, which has a package in both Ubuntu and Debian. I submitted it to Debian because I actually wanted it in Ubuntu, and I knew that Ubuntu pulls from Debian. And there are lots of people who use Debian, so I'd be killing two birds with one stone, so to speak. I'm also part of the team that's bidding to host DebConf 16 in Cape Town.

 22:21 <superfly> While I don't have a lot of time on my hands, my intention is to continue to contribute toward Ubuntu-ZA and Ubuntu in general via community participation, teaching others how to use Ubuntu and the technologies associated with it. Just recently, I revamped our website: https://www.ubuntu-za.org/ - it's still a bit of a work in progress, but we're getting there.

 22:21 <superfly> That's me in a nutshell.

 22:22 * inetpro votes +1 for superfly

 22:22 <s-fox> Can you tell us a little more about how you help to grow ubuntu-za ?

 22:22 * Kilos votes +1 for superfly

 22:23 <Kilos> s-fox  can i say something

 22:23 <superfly> Well, I am active on the mailing list and in IRC, where I help folks with problems, contribute ideas, etc.

 22:23 <superfly> And as I said before, I'm also the developer and maintainer of the web site.

 22:24 <s-fox> Okay, I see lots of support again.

 22:24 <s-fox> Anyone here to shout for superfly ?

 22:24 <inetpro> o/

 22:24 <Kilos> +1

 22:24 <cocooncrash> o/

 22:24 <inetpro> he is a tutor of note

 22:25 <inetpro> s-fox: others are sleeping unfortunately

 22:25 <superfly> Oh yes, almost forgot about that... I've started giving tutorials in IRC on bzr, Launchpad, and other technical things

 22:25 <Unit193> As a personal reference, +1

 22:26 <s-fox> Okay, time for a vote :)

 22:26 <Kilos> without superfly  our channel would be missing its life blood
