 16:37 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:37 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:37 <jdstrand> hey

 16:38 <jdstrand> so, I need to arrange travel for an upcoming sprint

 16:38 <jdstrand> I'm also helping interview candidates for FIPS/CC lead (https://ldd.tbe.taleo.net/ldd03/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=CANONICAL&cws=1&rid=1049)

 16:39 <jdstrand> I will be picking up the snappy security policy generation work (reviewing merges to me branch, finishing up the branch)

 16:40 <jdstrand> I have a number of sprint followups too

 16:40 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I just released an unzip regression fix

 16:40 <mdeslaur> and I have a number of embargoed issues I'm working on

 16:40 <mdeslaur> tomorrow I get to do patch piloting

 16:40 <mdeslaur> and if I have time, I'll pluck something off the list

 16:40 <mdeslaur> that's about it, sbeattie, you're up

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week.

 16:41 <sbeattie> I have an embargoed issue and an openjdk-7 regression fix to do.

 16:42 <sbeattie> I need to contact people to get a test archive rebuild going for the pie work

 16:43 <sbeattie> and that will probably consume most of my week, which will be a bit short (holiday weds, need to swap friday off)

 16:43 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:44 <tyhicks> I need to book upcoming sprint travel

 16:44 <tyhicks> I have Ubuntu Core Sprint followups from last week

 16:44 <tyhicks> still getting to the mapplauncherd review and profile development

 16:45 <tyhicks> and then I'll start working on making it easier to create AppArmor policy namespaces and to load AppArmor policy inside of user namespaces

 16:45 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:45 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <jjohansen> I am mostly working on apparmor stacking/namespaces

 16:46 <jjohansen> I need to finish up the experiment with the latest of the smack ns patches, and refresh to the set that was just put up

 16:47 <jjohansen> I also have bug 1511791 to finish chasing down

 16:47 <ubottu> bug 1511791 in apparmor (Ubuntu) "dbus rule regression with wpa supplicant profile" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1511791

 16:47 <tyhicks> jjohansen: that feels like a bug that I should chase down while you work on stacking

 16:47 <tyhicks> jjohansen: well, unless you feel like it is a kernel issue

 16:48 <jjohansen> tyhicks: feel free, specifically I am just looking at whether it is related to the signal issue I started chasing last week and haven't filed a bug on

 16:48 <jjohansen> I wasn't planning on chasing it into dbus

 16:49 <tyhicks> jjohansen: ok, only do as much on it as determining if it is the same bug as the signal issue

 16:49 <tyhicks> jjohansen: if not, punt it to me

 16:49 <jjohansen> ack

 16:49 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:49 <jjohansen> oh, and that means I should also finish getting together to post the code I put together for testing the signal issue

 16:50 <jjohansen> that is it for /me sarnold_ you are up?

 16:50 <tyhicks> haven't seen him yet

 16:50 <jjohansen> yeah

 16:51 <tyhicks> probably due to DST timing confusion

 16:51 <jjohansen> yep

 16:51 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: go ahead

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> This week, I've got an embargoed update to do. And possibly also Thunderbird

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I'll also be working on camera support in the browser for the phone, tidying up the Flash support in Oxide (it works pretty well now) and getting a fork of Chromium in git up and running

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I think that's me done

 16:54 <tyhicks> thanks!

 16:54 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
