 20:02 <elacheche_anis> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:02 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Jun  4 20:02:01 2015 UTC.  The chair is elacheche_anis. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:02 <meetingology> 

 20:02 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 20:02 <elacheche_anis> Ok, who is here for the meeting?

 20:02 <idrogn> hi

 20:02 <Kilos> o/

 20:02 <olive> ok. hello :)

 20:02 <toddy> o/

 20:02 <YoBoY> o/

 20:02 <winael> o/

 20:02 * cm-t I will be after olive , then karum_ , then winael

 20:02 <popey> o/

 20:03 <olive> c'est cm-t qui m'a obligé à candidater ici

 20:03 <olive> ça sert à quoi ? ;)

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting! The wiki page for

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> the Review Board is available here:

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> (FIFO). Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if

 20:03 <olive> I'm joking

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> needed, ask the applicant further questions. During this time it is

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> vote.

 20:03 <elacheche_anis> Let's start

 20:04 <elacheche_anis> #topic olive

 20:04 <olive> Ok. so my name is olive

 20:40 <elacheche_anis> #votesrequired 4

 20:40 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed

 20:40 <wxl> karum_: outside of helping to support ubuntu-fr events, what other contributions have you made/plan to do?

 20:40 <karum_> je participe aux autres évênements publics d'ubuntu: festivals par exemple

 20:41 <elacheche_anis> #chair elacheche_anis

 20:41 <meetingology> Current chairs: elacheche_anis

 20:41 <cm-t> he says: I join other event of ubuntu-fr like the webcafé in music festival

 20:41 <cm-t> he says (typing)

 20:41 <karum_> j'ai fait quelques propositions de traduction sur launchpad

 20:42 <cm-t> he says: I've made some translate on lauchpad

 20:42 <cm-t> launchpad

 20:42 <wxl> translations are super important

 20:42 <Kilos> very

 20:42 <idrogn> I may add that we (as french Loco council) want him to join our board

 20:42 <wxl> i think that's one of the best thing you can do as a non-english-speaking contributor

 20:43 <Kilos> i agree, we will need fench translations for africa soon

 20:43 <Kilos> french

 20:43 <YoBoY> Translator teams always need help, so many packages descriptions to do yet… :D

 20:59 <kamal> packages that he publishes as Launchpad PPA's and will soon be maintaining in

 20:59 <kamal> Debian.

 20:59 <kamal> His work is high quality, and more importantly, he is friendly and easy to work

 20:59 <kamal> with.  His efforts triaging the ham radio software bugs in Launchpad have also

 20:59 <kamal> been much appreciated.
