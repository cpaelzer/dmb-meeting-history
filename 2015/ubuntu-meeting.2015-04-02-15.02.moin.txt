 15:03 <slangasek> hmph :)

 15:03 <slangasek> ok one second

 15:05 <slangasek> * was on vacation last week; spent the first couple of days this week playing email catch-up

 15:05 <slangasek> * snappy: worked on getting initial arm64 builds done now that the IS firewalls have been sorted

 15:05 <slangasek> * phone: created a new channel flavor, "ubuntu-developer", with a different custom tarball by request of PES - all the things that are being open sourced from the BQ custom, but with extra bits not necessarily targeted to end users

 15:05 <slangasek> * various internal contract discussions

 15:05 <slangasek> * interviewing ongoing for the open java role

 15:05 <slangasek> (done)

 15:05 <slangasek> robru: are you ready yet? ;)

 15:05 <robru> slangasek: one sec

 15:06 <robru> * CI Train:

 15:06 <robru> - fixed bug with certain projects that contain spaces in bzr tags

 15:06 <robru> - fixed some bugs in the handling & reporting of "dirty" silos

 15:06 <robru> - record revids instead of revnos so that we can notice when people revise their bzr history

 15:06 <robru> - experimented with pushing active IRC notifications to #ubuntu-ci-eng instead of the current system of polling

 15:06 <robru> - fixed a race condition in the dirty silo handling

 15:06 <robru> - fixed a bug allowing silos in an inconsistent state to be cleaned more reliably

 15:06 <robru> - fixed a bug where watch_phase sometimes gets tripped up with old versions of source-only uploads in the silo PPA

 15:06 <robru> * Phablet Tools:

 15:06 <robru> - Fixed a bug where citrain tool was incorrectly interpreting zero-padded numbers as octal numbers and then installing the wrong silo on people's devices

 15:06 <robru> * CI Engine:

 15:06 <robru> - some iteration on spreadsheet replacement

 15:07 <slangasek> spaces are legal in bzr tags?

 15:07 <robru> slangasek: who knew!

 15:08 <slangasek> python2.7, people still use that? ;)  everyone should be using python3 by now, surely ;)

 15:08 <doko> well, there's a small package called openstack

 15:08 <slangasek> old technology, clearly

 15:08 <doko> and python2.7 crept in to the images again, have to check why

 15:08 <slangasek> doko: thanks for the go summary.  Do you know who was going to be proposing the FFe for golang?

 15:08 <doko> (done)

 15:09 <doko> slangasek, I know, but I don't know if I should share publically ;)

 15:15 <infinity> (done)

 15:15 <infinity> !!! NOTE: If you're using machines in 1SS today, use screen sessions, lamont is replacing the firewall today, and your network WILL go away, possibly for hours.

 15:15 <ubottu> infinity: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

 15:15 <xnox> cyphermox: design does not do slideshow updates, as far as I can tell it's a community thing in ubiquity-slideshows project or some such?! E.g. there are screenshots from me there and minor tweaks.

 15:15 <barry> stgraber: for sure!

 15:15 <cyphermox> stgraber: I was going to point that out in AOB :)

 15:15 <xnox> cyphermox: what needs doing?

 15:16 <xnox> infinity: gcrypt \o/

 15:16 <cyphermox> xnox: a vervet, for one.

 15:16 <cyphermox> to replace our shiny triangular unicorn :)

 15:17 <xnox> cyphermox: oh, right. that was usually poking the same person who designed default desktop wallpaper to snitch the vervet graphic. i guess poke the desktop team manager. he coordinated the wallpaper this time around

 15:17 <lamont> infinity: max 2 hours, expecting about 15 min or less

 15:17 <slangasek> cyphermox: did you arrive at that "nm-applet virtual interfaces" question independently, or did this come up in response to the bug I filed yesterday about NM eating my bridges? :)

 15:17 <infinity> lamont: I prefer to prepare for the worst and be pleasantly surprised. :)

 15:18 <cyphermox> slangasek: I had come to it independently when I initially did the NM 0.9.10 work; but it was low in my priority list, but then you pointed it out and someone filed a bug, so ...

 15:18 <infinity> slangasek: The NM virtual interfaces thing was reported by lots of people, in bugs and private grumbling.

 15:18 <lamont> infinity: ack

 15:18 <cyphermox> slangasek: NM shouldn't be eating bridges and this change won't keep it from doing it

 15:18 <slangasek> infinity: ok :)

 15:18 <infinity> (Lots of private grumbling)

 15:19 <cyphermox> it's really just avoiding people clicking on the bridge thingies in nm-applet and breaking the bridge that way

 15:19 <slangasek> any other questions over folks status?

 15:19 <cyphermox> oh

 15:20 <cyphermox> I might need quick review on a ubiquity merge

 15:20 <cyphermox> https://code.launchpad.net/~mathieu-tl/ubiquity/oem-config/+merge/255103

 15:20 <cyphermox> ^ the oem-config fixes above

 15:20 <slangasek> who can help with the above?  infinity, stgraber?

 15:20 <infinity> Yes, one of us. :P

 15:21 * xnox looks

 15:21 * infinity has it open in a tab now.

 15:21 <infinity> Already not happy about "sleep 5", but need context.  Will poke later. :P

 15:21 <slangasek> :)

 15:21 <cyphermox> sure ;)

 15:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] sprint planning

 15:22 <slangasek> so I've added a new tab to the core sprint planning spreadsheet for 'Foundations Agenda' - https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/spreadsheets/d/12QAyy4oB6uDzfrPrQqe54QiZzXEyFTbbQOUGvqZLrWo/edit#gid=628679993

 15:22 * ogra_ alwasy wondered why there is no "thunder round" after a "lightning round"

 15:22 <xnox> cyphermox: looks good, i ponder if we should do that for normal ubiquity as well.... including all the try-ubiquity/only-ubiquity modes.

 15:22 <slangasek> ogra_: the lightning is so far away that by the time the thunder arrives the meeting is over

 15:22 <cyphermox> ogra_: indeed. imaging we're doing lightning in space.

 15:22 <infinity> ogra_: Because we're close enough to the source that both happen together.

 15:22 <bdmurray> ogra_: because its the other way around

 15:22 <ogra_> slangasek, lol

 15:23 <slangasek> those of you who're coming to Austin, please throw in there the list of topics you plan to work on during the week

 15:23 <slangasek> especially anything that you're going to want other people's time on

 15:23 <stgraber> cyphermox: looks ok. Also not fond of the sleep but the alternative (wait loop) probably isn't much prettier. I'm also not that good at systemd units yet, so you unless you're sure about them, you may want pitti to take a look.

 15:24 <sil2100> I'll probably be running around discussing RTM plans for the future

 15:24 <slangasek> sil2100: fine, please add to the spreadsheet :)

 15:25 <slangasek> anything else on the subject of sprint planning?

 15:25 <robru> stgraber: can I get you to merge & deploy this queuebot update? https://code.launchpad.net/~robru/queuebot/new-spreadsheet/+merge/255106

 15:25 <sil2100> robru: I think he already did that

 15:26 <xnox> cyphermox: one thing, in upstart world, that blocking thing achieved was if/when ubiquity crashes on it's face the dm is brought up. Not that useful in oem-config case i guess, as one wouldn't know how to do oem login.

 15:26 <sil2100> robru: I poked him and queuebot is already switched (probably only live)

 15:26 <sil2100> robru: I tried poking and changing everything I could ;)

 15:26 <xnox> cyphermox: and there is no user setted up.

 15:26 <robru> sil2100: ok well this is a branch so the code gets updated properly and doesn't get reverted next time there's a rollout

 15:26 * bdmurray will brb

 15:26 <stgraber> robru: yeah, I already have a local commit here for that, just haven't pushed it to LP yet

 15:26 <xnox> cyphermox: i wonder if it would be possible to add oem-config.target as wantedby graphical.target and thus block it that way?

 15:26 <doko> slangasek, so I'm not allow to throw things?

 15:26 <robru> stgraber: thanks

 15:26 <doko> allowed even

 15:27 <xnox> cyphermox: and at the end of oem-config, remove that wantedby?

 15:27 <cyphermox> xnox: you kind of still need to make sure oem-config is what runs after reboot from running oem-config-prepare. this worked, at lest

 15:27 <cyphermox> xnox: heh

 15:27 <xnox> cyphermox: yeah, so prepare would add graphical.target.wants/oem-config.taget. and end of oem-config would remove that.

 15:27 <xnox> cyphermox: rather than fiddling with default-targets. Note that this oh...

 15:28 <xnox> cyphermox: this totally breaks oem-config on the server, which doesn't have graphical.target =)

 15:28 <cyphermox> there was one issue with how when we remove oem-config it deletes the files

 15:28 <cyphermox> actually

 15:28 <slangasek> doko: you can throw things, but if you're not at the sprint it may or may not stick ;)  happy to discuss it with you offline

 15:28 <cyphermox> server does do graphical.target too.

 15:28 <xnox> cyphermox: oh, ok.

 15:28 <cyphermox> unexpected, I agree

 15:29 <cyphermox> xnox: let's discuss this later in a better location.

 15:30 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:30 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:30 <cyphermox> drinking in YUL next week?

 15:30 <barry> when do you guys head to austin?

 15:30 <infinity> For those who missed it in the chatter last time, 1SS firewall going away this afternoon, plan accordingly.

 15:30 <cyphermox> :)

 15:30 <caribou> I can think of better places than YUL for drinks

 15:31 <cyphermox> barry: saturday.

 15:31 <barry> cool.  i get in on tuesday night

 15:31 <caribou> but I won't be there, going back to sleep

 15:31 <slangasek> saturday> cyphermox apparently needs an extra day of barbecue

 15:31 <cyphermox> err, wait, I meant sunday

 15:31 <barry> maybe thursday?

 15:31 <cyphermox> works for me

 15:32 <stgraber> thursday works for me

 15:32 <barry> on the calendar!

 15:33 <slangasek> #endmeeting
