 16:31 <tyhicks> Those four contributions are very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:31 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:31 <jdstrand> indeed-- lots of contributions. awesome! :)

 16:31 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:31 <tyhicks> yes, great contributions! :)

 16:33 <jdstrand> this week I plan to work on helping define snappy hardware access

 16:33 <jdstrand> and also picking up a bit on snappy fingerprint

 16:33 <jdstrand> I'll also be working on an embargoed issue

 16:34 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:35 <mdeslaur> I'm working on updates, as usual...ntp is going out today, and I have krb5 to test

 16:35 <mdeslaur> that's it, sbeattie, you're up

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'm jumping back in to the rotation, and am on Community this week.

 16:36 <sbeattie> I'm testing my binutils update (finally!) and will release that today.

 16:36 <sbeattie> After that, I'll jump back on gcc-pie-for-amd64.

 16:37 <sbeattie> That's it for me; tyhicks, you're up.

 16:37 <tyhicks> I'm jumping back in the rotation, as well

 16:37 <tyhicks> I'm in the new bug triage role this week

 16:38 <tyhicks> I need to fix some tools and close out a lot of invalid bug tasks

 16:38 <tyhicks> I've finalized v4 of the dbus-daemon AppArmor mediation patch set and need to finish testing it and then attach the patches to the upstream bug

 16:39 <tyhicks> I still haven't gotten to proposing v2 of the libapparmor API changes but need to do that ASAP

 16:39 <tyhicks> I should be able to start on that this afternoon

 16:40 <tyhicks> the patch update was put on the backburner last week since upstream drastically changed their fix for one of the CVEs

 16:40 <tyhicks> it looks like their tree has settled down and that I should go back to fixing those issues in patch

 16:40 <tyhicks> that's probably all that I'll get to this week

 16:40 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:43 <jjohansen> So it seems I have most of the stack from last week and a few more items as well. There is an apparmor meeting this week, with some discussion needed around the kernel interface context (mode values), the is any v2 libapparmor aa_features API discussion an review that hits, Casey's LSM stacking patch

 16:44 <jjohansen> I still need to work on the second revision of the deleted socket mediation bug

 16:44 <jjohansen> and of course continue with the kernel code cleanup

 16:45 <jjohansen> I think that is it from me, sarnold you're up

 16:47 <sarnold> I'm on CVE triage this week; I'm hoping to return to the horizon update and finally make forward progress there again, as well as get the hang of the serverstack cloud for testing openstack updates. there's also a backlog of MIRs outstanding, I may get to those during testing runs, if the testing runs happen :)

 16:47 <sarnold> that's it for me, looks like no chris, tyhicks?

 16:48 <jdstrand> I think chrisccoulson is here

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:48 <jdstrand> hi! :)

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> This week, I'll be getting a new oxide release out and continuing with stuff in https://launchpad.net/oxide/+milestone/branch-1.6

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> And that's about it :)

 16:49 <sarnold> sorry chrisccoulson, not sure how my tab key and I failed :)

 16:51 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:51 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
