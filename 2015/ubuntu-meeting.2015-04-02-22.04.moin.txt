 22:17 <marcoceppi_> err cwayne ^

 22:19 <cwayne> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for April 2, 2015

 22:19 <cwayne> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:19 <cwayne> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:19 <cwayne> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:20 <cwayne> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:20 <cwayne> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:20 <cwayne> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers amounts to at least +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:20 <cwayne> #votesrequired 4

 22:20 <meetingology> votes now need 4 to be passed

 22:31 <elfy> I've read the wiki - but I'd quite like some unrehearsed words - they'll tell me more than that

 22:31 <wxl> as a non-board/council member, but to facilitate conversation, i'd love to hear more on what you'd like to do with ubuntu touch, d4rk-5c0rp

 22:33 <elfy> d4rk-5c0rp: give me some feeling :)

 22:34 <d4rk-5c0rp> wxl, I still exploring some ubuntu-touch tricks, I tried to make two apps before, but they really need some features for now, may be I'll start by getting an ubuntu-phone first, then I'll try to make some training session with people in my Loco

 22:35 <cyphermox> d4rk-5c0rp: si vous avez des difficult√©s en anglais, je peux traduire.

 22:36 <elfy> d4rk-5c0rp: that's great stuff - how do you feel about getting other people involved?

 22:36 <d4rk-5c0rp> elfy, I want to move from just helping people to use ubuntu, to help them to make apps for ubuntu

 22:36 <cyphermox> that's great

 22:36 <elfy> for sure

 22:36 <cyphermox> elfy: thanks for facilitating the discussions :)

 22:37 <elfy> cyphermox: do we have a language thing?

 22:37 <elfy> eg

 22:37 <cyphermox> what do you mean?

 22:37 <d4rk-5c0rp> I have some ideas about some stuff like some simple dev tools that I want to write and share with the community, but it's just a matter of time for now

 22:38 <elfy> cyphermox: I'm english .. with stupid

 22:39 <cwayne> d4rk-5c0rp, do you have any specific dev tools in mind?

 22:39 <elfy> d4rk-5c0rp:that's great :)

 22:40 <Mikaela> and here I was imagining that this channel had topiclock

 22:40 <d4rk-5c0rp> I have an idea if some generators like CSS things for example, I want to make some kind of game to help kids to get used to cli too

 22:41 <cwayne> d4rk-5c0rp, that sounds great!

 22:41 <cyphermox> not fast enough I guess :)

 22:42 <cyphermox> thanks cwayne, DalekSec

 22:42 <DalekSec> cyphermox: Sure.  Welcome.

 22:43 <d4rk-5c0rp> cwayne, all I need now is time, maybe I'll try to write such tools during a hackathon with my LoCo

 22:43 <cyphermox> DalekSec: could you please do the same for #ubuntu-desktop, #ubuntu-devel

 22:44 * marcoceppi_ is ready to vote

 22:51 <cwayne> #subtopic Cheng-Chia Tseng (zerng07)

 22:51 <zerng07> Hi everyone, I am Cheng-Chia Tseng, username as zerng07.

 22:51 <zerng07> I lived in Taiwan, and have been contributing to Ubuntu since 2010. The most of the work I focus on is about localization.

 22:51 <zerng07> Besides Ubuntu, I also contribute to other FLOSS projects such as GNOME, LibreOffice, Translation Project...etc.

 22:51 <zerng07> I am also a GNOME Member and The Document Foundation Member.

 22:51 <zerng07> My personal wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Zerng07

 22:51 <cwayne> Hi there zerng07 :)

 22:51 <marcoceppi_> o/ hello zerng07

 22:51 <zerng07> :)

 22:51 <wxl> send me some good oolong and we'll make you a member, zerng07. (kidding! well, kind of. i wouldn't mind the tea ‚ò∫)

 22:52 <zerng07> Haha!

 22:52 <marcoceppi_> zerng07: very nice contributions so far. Curious, what are (briefly) a few of the things you'd change in the community today?

 22:52 <zerng07> We do have good oolong here!

 22:52 <wxl> i know!

 22:53 <zerng07> I want to change most is about local community in Taiwan.

 22:53 <wxl> cool!

 22:53 <zerng07> As mentined in wiki, we have few contributors here.

 22:54 <zerng07> and there are always some argues in local forum.

 22:54 <wxl> i see there's no lp link on your wiki page so https://launchpad.net/~zerng07

 22:54 <marcoceppi_> wxl: thanks

 22:55 <wxl> are you thinking about taking over the leadership of the tw loco, zerng07? or what are you thinking?

 22:55 <zerng07> Nope

 22:55 <wxl> oh man the tw loco mailing list is dead :(

 22:56 <wxl> sounds like you may have to do some work really building community

 22:56 <zerng07> I would like to help with bluet to make loco more close to ubuntu community.

 22:56 <zerng07> Yeah...

 22:57 <zerng07> that's ture.

 22:57 <zerng07> tw loco is not in good shape.

 22:57 <cwayne> zerng07, can you go into some detail about 'suggesting the proper way to deal with Traditional Chinese locale'?  Do you mean in terms of input methods, fonts, etc?

 22:58 <zerng07> yeah.

 22:58 <wxl> taiwan covers ‚Öì of the area of oregon. one of the biggest struggles i have in our loco is uniting that much area, but we're getting there. should be a bit easier for you. start with people you know and branch out from there!

 22:58 <zerng07> I know how to configure those setting well.

 22:59 <zerng07> How to make the system feel confortable for Chinese.

 22:59 <zerng07> such as fontcnfig configuration.

 22:59 <cwayne> have you contributed to Ubuntu Kylin?

 22:59 <zerng07> wxl: thank you!

 22:59 <wxl> are those things you could borrow from ubuntu kylin?

 22:59 <wxl> oh hehehe gmta

 22:59 <zerng07> I have not contributed to Ubuntu Kylin.

 23:00 <zerng07> It is mainly for mainland Chia users.

 23:00 <cwayne> ah, I hadn't realized that, oops :)

 23:00 <zerng07> Some services and apps are not used in Taiwan.

 23:00 <wxl> yeah i expect that the project as a whole is not applicable but i'm sure there are some parts of their work that could make yours easier

 23:01 <wxl> and vice versa!

 23:01 <zerng07> Yeah.

 23:01 <zerng07> :)

 23:02 <zerng07> Ubuntu Kylin brings some changes to Taiwan too. They are going to change the default input method framework for chinese locale.

 23:02 <zerng07> I have known Aroon Xu who is behind this work.

 23:02 <zerng07> Aron

 23:04 <zerng07> I will do some tests and make the switch smooth.

 23:04 <wxl> excellent!

 23:04 <zerng07> That is what I always do. :)

 23:11 <ianorlin> I also am involved in the ubuntu-california loco and am one of 3 elected leaders and the biggest event I planned was scale

 23:12 <ianorlin> I have also helped triage bugs and submitted some small patches for typos and was a backup relase manager for lubuntu last Thursday for final beta

 23:12 <wxl> (and did such a good job with that, he'll probably continue to be backup should i go on a vacation during milestones again!)

 23:13 <ianorlin> thanks wxl

 23:13 <wxl> np!

 23:13 <ianorlin> hggdh you're welcome

 23:14 <cwayne> ianorlin, do you see yourself working towards more code contributions, or do you think your primary contributions will remain QA/testing?

 23:15 <ianorlin> I want to help on testing but will work towards some code contributions if I can understand it but I find the hard part is wrapping my head around all the libraries needed to contriubte code to lxqt for example which is wehre the development of lubuntu is headed

 23:19 <cwayne> ah yeah, I can imagine that being quite complex :)

 23:25 <wxl> holy testimonials, ahayzen

 23:25 <ahayzen> Hey folks, my name is Andrew Hayzen I am a student studying a BSc in Software Engineering and started using Ubuntu in 2009.

 23:25 <ahayzen> My main contribution to Ubuntu has been over the past year and a half in which I have been working on the Ubuntu Touch Core Apps project, mainly the Music-app.

 23:26 <ahayzen> This has involved a variety of tasks such has learning QML/Qt, working with 'upstream' projects, other community members and canonical employees, triaging and fixing bugs, using the Nexus 4 (mako) with Ubuntu Touch as a daily driver and many other exciting things :)

 23:26 <Neo31> wxl, I was concerned about the question you asked about Ubuntu Touch in the beginning of this meeting. do you have good contacts with great knowledge of ubuntu touch core development? We need some help

 23:26 <wxl> Neo31: meeting'
