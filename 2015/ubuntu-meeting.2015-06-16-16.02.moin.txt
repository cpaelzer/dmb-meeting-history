 16:06 <arosales> thanks rharper

 16:06 <arosales> any bugs folks would like to discuss before moving on

 16:07 <arosales> I'll take it folks are ready for BPs then

 16:07 <arosales> . . .

 16:07 <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-w/group/topic-w-server.html   not working for me either today

 16:08 <teward> arosales: confirmed, 404.

 16:08 <arosales> we have http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-w/group/topic-w-openstack.html

 16:08 <arosales> but not server

 16:08 <arosales> rharper, smoser: do you guys have a topic BP?

 16:09 <smoser> checking. i dont think we probably do.

 16:10 <smoser> or i do not think we do

 16:10 <matsubara> arosales, http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-w/canonical-server.html and http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-w/ubuntu-server.html might give a better overview of server BPs

 16:10 <matsubara> since the topic url is not working...

 16:11 <arosales> matsubara, ok, do folks agree here we should update the meeting commands to these links?

 16:11 * matsubara doesn't really know what's more appropriate in this case

 16:11 <arosales> #action smoser update Topic blueprint URLs, if necessary

 16:11 * meetingology smoser update Topic blueprint URLs, if necessary

 16:12 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-w/canonical-server.html

 16:13 <arosales> same blueprint there

 16:14 <arosales> and as said before servercloud-w-openstack-liberty is progressing

 16:14 <arosales> but seems there should be some other BPs there . .  .

 16:14 <arosales> smoser, jamespage need to follow up if the correct BPs are linked  ^

 16:15 <arosales> perhaps because https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-w-server is blank atm ?

 16:15 <arosales> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-w-server

 16:15 <arosales> in any case an action item is made to follow up.

 16:16 <arosales> Ping here if folks have any BPs items they would like to surface

 16:19 <arosales> teward, using https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting/IRCCommands

 16:19 <arosales> linked from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting

 16:19 <arosales> teward, was there another topic?

 16:19 <teward> arosales: there's an item on the Agenda page added by me, and I'd like Server Team input on the course of action

 16:19 <teward> arosales: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting - NGINX in Ubuntu: Course of Action discussion (teward)

 16:20 <teward> popped on in the middle of last week

 16:20 <arosales> teward, ahh, sorry for missing that

 16:20 <teward> perhaps it was missed?

 16:20 <teward> no problem :)

 16:20 <arosales> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2015-June/007072.html

 16:21 <teward> Previously, up until now, Debian was using a Stable branch of the NGINX web server's code as the package base.

 16:21 <teward> Recently, based on what they do with Debian release times as far as I can gather, they're now using an NGINX Mainline branch, which is their feature-development branch.

 16:22 <teward> Further questions on that branch can be directed to LinuxJedi who is here currently, and is a Senior Developer Advocate for the nginx upstream people

 16:22 <LinuxJedi> o/

 16:22 <teward> Currently, as of 15.04, we are using the Stable branch of NGINX in Ubuntu, which is mirroring Debian's choice of package versions.  However, following them will have Wily get 1.9.1 currently, which will likely remain that way through next LTS

 16:23 <teward> While both versions are 'stable' enough to be used in production environments, and indeed I do have a couple Mainline nginx versions running in production, that is a changing development branch, replete with new features.

 16:23 <teward> 1.8.x is the NGINX Stable branch, which receives critical bug fixes and security updates but forgoes the additional features.

 16:24 <hallyn> you expect a stable branch of the current devel branch by 16.02 ?

 16:24 <teward> hallyn: from what LinuxJedi has told me, such release (1.10.x) will be very near or after FinalFreeze or release date for LTS

 16:24 <hallyn> that's unfortunate :)

 16:25 <LinuxJedi> but there shouldn't be much change from 1.9.x to 1.10.0 at that stage

 16:25 <teward> they release the 'mainline' as stable in April, and judging by the last release date, April 21, on or near that date would put us really close to release date

 16:25 <hallyn> but if we could get a 1.10.alpha1 that might be good.  i assume the stable releases will be supported much longer than devel

 16:25 <hallyn> i think it's worth asking the release time for best option there

 16:26 <teward> To finish my initial thought stream: I'd like the Server Team to provide some guidance for Wily, as to how we proceed

 16:26 <hallyn> hm, no rbasak today

 16:26 <teward> A merge of 1.9.1 wouldn't take too long.  Merging in changes from Debian's packaging and merging that with 1.8.x is doable by myself, but would diverge from the standard process of getting packaging from Debian

 16:27 <hallyn> you already emailed ubntu-server about this right?

 16:27 <teward> hallyn: indeed.  I did ask Seth Arnold (sarnold) for his opinions, he responded to the email thread on the server mailing list

 16:27 <smoser> teward, well, the questions hallyn asked apply for wily as well as x (16.04)

 16:27 <hallyn> right,

 16:27 <teward> hallyn: the email link that arosales posted.

 16:27 <teward> smoser: indeed.

 16:27 <teward> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2015-June/007072.html

 16:27 <smoser> we dont want to move forward in wily if we would then have to move back.

 16:27 <hallyn> i'd follow sarnold's guidance :)

 16:27 <hallyn> teward: how long do you expect 1.9 to be supported?

 16:27 <LinuxJedi> it is worth noting that useful LTS features such as HTTP/2 will be in 1.10

 16:27 <teward> hallyn: doing so would place us on 1.9.x.

 16:28 <teward> hallyn: until 1.10.x release in April, I believe.  LinuxJedi: that's the upstream support period, if I'm not mistaken?

 16:28 <LinuxJedi> correct

 16:28 <hallyn> teward: i'm wondering whehter we can put things in place now to take 1.9 now, and have process ready to take 1.10 as an exceptional sru in 16.05

 16:28 <hallyn> or, again,

 16:29 <hallyn> ask upstream for a alpha or beta release in feb or march of 2016

 16:29 <smoser> hallyn is right. this is not significantly different then what we do for openstack.

 16:29 <smoser> or at least possibly not much different

 16:29 <rharper> if 1.9.x isn't far apart from 1.10.0, why wouldn't 1.9 have the http2 and other features we'd want in the LTS?

 16:29 <LinuxJedi> it will

 16:29 <hallyn> not htat we want it to become the norm :)  but in 2019 we'll likely be wishing we'd done it

 16:30 <hallyn> rharper: it's just that 1.9 likely won't be supported for 5 years upstream, so a stable would be nicer for 16.04

 16:30 <teward> rharper: provided Debian has it uploaded and available, I'd rather *not* have to do manual source version merges by hand, although I do so for the PPAs already provided under ~nginx on Launchpad

 16:30 <LinuxJedi> 1.9.x is mainline where new features are added. 1.10.0 will be the end release of the 1.9.x series

 16:30 <rharper> right, the support from upstream

 16:30 <rharper> teward: and the package maint;

 16:31 <hallyn> teward: ok, let's see if rbasak is willing to take this to release team, if not i'll volunteer ,t ocome up with options

 16:31 <LinuxJedi> we have odd numbers for mainline and even numbers for stable. And only one odd and one even maintained at any time (so currently 1.8 and 1.9 are maintained)

 16:31 <hallyn> ok how long will 1.10 be supported?

 16:31 <LinuxJedi> until 1.12

 16:31 <hallyn> which is when

 16:31 <teward> hallyn: ack

 16:31 <teward> hallyn: april 2017

 16:31 <hallyn> nyears

 16:31 <hallyn> hm

 16:31 <LinuxJedi> 1 year

 16:31 <hallyn> so tha'ts not much of an extra cushion

 16:32 <hallyn> so we really want an MRE here or something

 16:32 <teward> hallyn: MRE was considered in the past but we have a weird exception:

 16:32 <teward> nginx-core is in main, the other flavors are in Universe, because of third party modules

 16:32 <teward> and security team suggestions/recommendations during the MIR

 16:32 <teward> (back for 14.04)

 16:32 <hallyn> ok i'll need to go read the MIR comments then

 16:33 <hallyn> (assuming rbasak doesn't handle it :)

 16:33 <teward> hallyn: i think the MRE discussion wasn't on the MIR, and was handled after the fact

 16:33 <hallyn> teward: do you have links?  can you send them in a reply to sarnold's email?

 16:33 <hallyn> (bc i haven't got the thread to reply to)

 16:33 <teward> hallyn: to the discussions?  I could try and find the irclogs links, but I think my discussions with rbasak on that were in private

 16:33 <hallyn> oh, ok

 16:33 <hallyn> np

 16:34 <teward> the MIR was https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+bug/1262710

 16:34 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1262710 in nginx (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nginx" [Undecided,Fix released]

 16:34 <hallyn> arosales: can you post an action for me to follow up (email rbasak etc)?

 16:34 <arosales> #action hallyn to see if rbasak is willing to take this (nginx version in 15.10 and looking to 16.04)  to release team, if not hallyn to volunteer, to come up with options

 16:34 * meetingology hallyn to see if rbasak is willing to take this (nginx version in 15.10 and looking to 16.04)  to release team, if not hallyn to volunteer, to come up with options
