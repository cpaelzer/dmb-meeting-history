 15:01:26 <NCommander> so who's here this morning?

 15:01:28 <janimo> hi

 15:01:42 * davidm things the 11.10 release is fantastic

 15:01:59 * ogra_ too

 15:02:14 <ogra_> nothing to discuss actually :)

 15:02:21 <janimo> AOB? :)

 15:02:28 <NCommander> closingmeeting in

 15:02:29 <NCommander> 3

 15:02:32 <ogra_> well, probably opening of armhf

 15:02:33 <NCommander> ;-)

 15:02:37 <janimo> when does P churn start?

 15:02:43 <ogra_> and lets look across the specs

 15:02:49 <janimo> rebuilds and the corresponding FTBFS that is

 15:02:51 <ogra_> janimo, i think it started on monday

 15:02:56 <davidm> Nice job to all that helped with everything

 15:02:59 <ogra_> toolchain that is

 15:03:00 <NCommander> [topic] P Blueprints

 15:03:15 * ogra_ is in the middle of registering them

 15:04:01 * NCommander is working on drafting and editing them and their assiocated wiki pages

 15:04:23 <NCommander> make sure you keep the PBlueprintIdeas page updated with links and such so I can find all the blueprints

 15:05:09 <ogra_> right

 15:05:27 <ogra_> NCommander, did you already delegate the server specs ?

 15:05:33 <ogra_> (you said you wanted to)

 15:05:58 <davidm> NCommander, I know robbie has been updating some of the sever bp

 15:06:31 <NCommander> ogra_: I'm doing the reigsterations for them. After UDS and we have a better idea of what we're doing, I'll start assigning specs off

 15:06:55 <ogra_> NCommander, you should do it before rather, else you get assigned all the BOFs

 15:06:59 <ogra_> ;)

 15:07:01 * ahs3 can help with some of the server specs, if needed

 15:07:23 <NCommander> ogra_: well, let me get them all drafted, and in next weeks meeting we'll auctionthem of

 15:07:31 <ogra_> NCommander, and last i saw you you only had one body that can sit in one session ;)

 15:07:43 <NCommander> [action] NCommanderto deglate serverspecs during next IRC meeting

 15:07:43 * meetingology NCommanderto deglate serverspecs during next IRC meeting

 15:08:09 <NCommander> ogra_: other-p-clone-ncommander spec requires implementation beforeUDS

 15:08:11 * ogra_ only misses adams specs, will do that right after the meeting

 15:08:22 <ogra_> NCommander, put some WIs up

 15:08:38 <ogra_> ah, wait, tracker is closed, wont happen before P opens :P

 15:08:47 <NCommander> yup

 15:08:58 <NCommander> I think we've covered everything spec related

 15:09:04 <NCommander> [topic] AOB

 15:09:06 <ogra_> yeah

 15:09:12 <NCommander> Anyone got anything or can I close it out?

 15:09:27 <ogra_> well, some info on hf would be nice, but i guess next meeting will do

 15:09:55 <NCommander> no infinity :-/

 15:09:58 <NCommander> anyway

 15:09:59 <davidm> Yea I really wanted some info too

 15:09:59 <ogra_> colse unless davidm objects
