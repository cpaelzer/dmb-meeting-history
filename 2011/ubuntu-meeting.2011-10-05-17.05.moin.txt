 17:05:14 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Previous Actions

 17:05:29 <nuclearbob> only previous action I have is nuclearbob chairing the next meeting, so I think we can check that off

 17:05:57 <nuclearbob> if there's nothing else, we'll proceed to the next topic

 17:07:08 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Community Efforts/Testing

 17:08:01 <nuclearbob> jibel, anything on this?

 17:08:24 <Ursinha> nuclearbob, I'm here!

 17:08:38 <nuclearbob> groovy

 17:09:03 <nuclearbob> got anything on community efforts/testing?

 17:09:32 <Ursinha> not me

 17:09:40 <nuclearbob> all right

 17:10:04 <nuclearbob> I guess we're counting down to the Oneiric release at this point

 17:10:58 <nuclearbob> the last report on that seems to be the same one we had last week:

 17:10:59 <nuclearbob> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ReleaseReports/OneiricBeta2TestReport

 17:11:22 <nuclearbob> If nobody else has anything on that, we can move to the next topic

 17:12:17 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Automated/Systems Testing

 17:12:58 <nuclearbob> still doing qrt over here, I'll try to get that blueprint registered this week

 17:13:29 <nuclearbob> I'll bring some proposals for dependency specification on different releases to UDS so we can determine the best way to move forward

 17:14:04 <nuclearbob> jibel had a pretty boot speed chart for us last week, anything new this week on the automation front?

 17:16:45 <nuclearbob> sounds like not, so we'll move on

 17:16:52 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Engineering Team Bug Status

 17:17:34 * Ursinha has nothing to report, was on holidays

 17:17:39 <nuclearbob> hggdh, Ursinha, pedro_, or bdummary, do any of you have anything here?

 17:17:43 <Ursinha> ..

 17:18:24 <pedro_> nope nothing from here

 17:21:03 <nuclearbob> sounds like nothing earthshaking to report

 17:21:22 <nuclearbob> so let's move on

 17:21:29 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Other Topics

 17:23:36 <nuclearbob> doesn't seem like we have any other topics

 17:23:59 <Ursinha> the quietest meeting ever

 17:24:26 <nuclearbob> I guess we can move to the next topic

 17:24:32 <nuclearbob> [TOPIC] Chair Selection

 17:24:38 <pedro_> I can do that

 17:24:48 <nuclearbob> select the chair, or chair?
