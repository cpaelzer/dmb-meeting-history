 16:05:35 <SpamapS> lol

 16:06:01 <smoser> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:06:12 <smoser> no action points.

 16:06:23 <smoser> so thats a free pass onto....

 16:06:28 <smoser> [TOPIC] Oneiric Development

 16:06:54 <Daviey> As you all must know by now we are in Beta2 freeze.

 16:07:00 <Daviey> With it shipping this Thursday.

 16:07:22 <smoser> Yes, only the great ones are allowed to upload, like zul.

 16:07:25 <Daviey> This is a great chance to get testing of the iso in as many ways possible.

 16:07:28 <Daviey> Also, we need to consolidate bugs that need fixing

 16:07:50 <Daviey> I notice smoser has been busy raising and fixing some nova issues, do you have any news on them landing?

 16:08:14 <Daviey> smoser: No, everyone can still upload.. just main fixes need to be b2 crticial.

 16:08:16 <smoser> i landed more changes in nova milestone branch in the past 4 days than i'd care to admit to

 16:08:40 <Daviey> i noticed.

 16:08:40 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html <- any bugs that need to be decalred there?

 16:08:43 <smoser> but, i'm actually pretty excited about nova's state.

 16:08:49 * AlanBell goes to fix a bug in the topic handling code to prevent Meeting Meetings

 16:09:11 <zul> they should be in the archive today hopefully

 16:09:14 <Daviey> smoser: Action AlanBell to that pls :)

 16:09:35 <SpamapS> Daviey: I'm pretty convinced that bug 653405 is "fixed" .. but we need somebody to confirm that.

 16:09:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 653405 in rabbitmq-server (Ubuntu Oneiric) "rabbitmq-server fails to start if hostname is unresolvable or has changed since first starting" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/653405

 16:09:41 <Daviey> I could also do with some help with things that need release noting.

 16:09:41 <Daviey> So if you have anything, please raise it :)

 16:10:07 <Daviey> hmm

 16:10:07 <Daviey> someone was looking at that earlier this week

 16:10:07 <Daviey> was it lynxman ?

 16:10:11 <smoser> Daviey, ...

 16:10:19 <smoser> bug 854614 should be on our release list

 16:10:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854614 in nova (Ubuntu) "metadata service local-hostname is not fqdn" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854614

 16:10:28 <SpamapS> Daviey: also bug 831628 is fixed but sitting in the b2 freeze queue so will land after b2 I think.

 16:10:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 831628 in squid (Ubuntu) "squid upstart script doesn't check for filesystems" [Low,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/831628

 16:10:35 <smoser> this is something that JuJu views as being important.

 16:11:06 <Daviey> smoser: 854614 i tagged just before this meeting, thanks

 16:11:07 <lynxman> Daviey: wasn't me, we just need to confirm that the new version of Erlang and rabbitmq 2.5.0 works as intended

 16:11:10 <smoser> yeah.

 16:11:29 <SpamapS> Also I think we can stop tracking bug 829063 unless my concerns were addressed

 16:11:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 829063 in glance (Ubuntu) "should use SSL by default" [Wishlist,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/829063

 16:12:08 <Daviey> SpamapS: Considering how bad squid has been on upgrades, is this one worth landing for b2?

 16:12:11 <Daviey> As in, get it in early?

 16:12:46 <macer1> Hello, is this ubuntu server team meeting?

 16:12:53 <zul> SpamapS: the glance ssl stuff is still being reviewed upstream

 16:12:55 <smoser> macer1, it is.

 16:12:57 <smoser> welcome

 16:13:11 <SpamapS> Daviey: all the problems on upgrade were caused by the old upstart scripts.. hasn't been a problem since the change to use -N and drop 'expect fork' from what I can tell.

 16:13:41 <SpamapS> Daviey: but, if squid is not on the CD.. then yeah why not land it now?

 16:13:50 <Daviey> SpamapS: hmm, i thought we had to double tap an SRU for that fix?

 16:14:26 <Daviey> SpamapS: ok, will look the package over after the meeting

 16:15:36 <Daviey> Triage, Triage, Triage - not just step 1 :)

 16:15:36 <Daviey> smoser: move on?

 16:15:38 <smoser> yep

 16:15:41 <smoser> the other thing is ...

 16:15:53 <smoser> we are testing ISOs very soon.

 16:16:02 <smoser> Daviey, are you aware of anything that would prevenet testing of $MEDIA ?

 16:16:29 <smoser> utlemming would likely be interested as i believe he expects to start testing cloud-images today

 16:16:32 <Daviey> smoser: the candidate posted will amost certainly not be final

 16:16:43 <smoser> gold

 16:16:44 <adam_g> we should probably free up the QA test cluster from our openstack testing?

 16:16:49 <Daviey> So testing is still useful, don't hold out.

 16:16:59 <smoser> moving on then.

 16:17:12 <smoser> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:17:18 <Daviey> adam_g: The test cluster could really do with streching it to the limits.

 16:18:06 <smoser> The Openstack Developer Summit [http://summit.openstack.org] is in 2 weeks

 16:18:17 <Daviey> wow, really only two weeks away

 16:18:30 <Daviey> happy days.

 16:18:31 <smoser> UDS is actually not far off, especially if you're expecting to get flights and travel accomodations

 16:18:32 <zul> hopefully i can make it ;)

 16:18:46 * smoser writes a memo to self to get flights

 16:18:58 <smoser> anything else to note ?

 16:19:07 <adam_g> puppetconf is this week

 16:19:09 <Daviey> I'll be at the London release party 13th October

 16:19:21 <rbasak> It seems that I'll be there too!

 16:19:27 <adam_g> lynxman and i will likely be giving lightning talk on juju + ubuntu server

 16:19:28 <Daviey> rbasak: nonoes.

 16:19:34 <zul> release party = booze up

 16:19:37 <robbiew> adam_g: sweet

 16:20:04 <SpamapS> Who all will be at the Openstack Dev summit btw?

 16:20:06 * SpamapS raises hand

 16:20:14 * adam_g <-

 16:20:14 * zul me

 16:20:15 * smoser raises hand

 16:20:32 * SpamapS raises ttx's hand

 16:20:32 <zul> <-- already submitted a proposal

 16:20:35 <smoser> also i suspect that ttx and soren to will be there. kirkland also.

 16:20:51 <smoser> ok. enough chitchat. moving on.

 16:20:52 * kirkland waves a thumbs up

 16:20:58 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:21:01 <smoser> hggdh, ^

 16:21:12 <Daviey> o/

 16:21:55 <SpamapS> I have a question about getting SRU verification help on the occasional important bug..

 16:22:41 <SpamapS> mdeslaur was asking if we could finish the squid SRU bug 750371 so he didn't have to supersede it and I didn't know how to get it onto our QA team's radar

 16:22:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 750371 in squid (Ubuntu Maverick) "squid causing /var to stay busy during shutdown" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/750371

 16:23:01 <SpamapS> hggdh: ideas?

 16:23:47 <robbiew> :/

 16:24:23 <smoser> ok. then.

 16:24:48 <smoser> [ACTION] hggdh and SpamapS to discuss SRU verification work for bug 750371 at next meeting or before

 16:24:48 * meetingology hggdh and SpamapS to discuss SRU verification work for bug 750371 at next meeting or before

 16:24:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 750371 in squid (Ubuntu Maverick) "squid causing /var to stay busy during shutdown" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/750371

 16:24:56 <smoser> anyone else have anything here ?

 16:25:18 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:25:22 <smb> Since there was Plumbers two weeks ago and /me on holiday last week there is not much new. Still not completely happy with Xen HVM and filed bug 854829 just now. Also trying to see whether bug 854050 is somehow reproducable. And if it is whether an updated kernel would help. People seem to have a habbit of using the ami of an release without updating.

 16:25:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854829 in xen (Ubuntu) "[Oneiric] Xen HVM: transmit timeouts on emulated 8139cp device" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854829

 16:25:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854050 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG at /build/buildd/linux-2.6.38/mm/swapfile.c:255" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854050

 16:25:59 <smoser> smb, yeah, sorry to have dumped that swap bug on you.

 16:26:18 <smoser> and the slew of mis-data that is the aws forums

 16:26:28 <Daviey> bug 790712

 16:26:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Oneiric) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:26:33 <smb> smoser, no worries, just one of those which seem to happen "sometimes"

 16:26:37 <smoser> one happy event on that, though, the original reporter of that hit a hang

 16:26:41 <smoser> and called Amazon on support

 16:26:46 <Daviey> bug 818177

 16:26:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818177 in udev (Ubuntu) "HP DL380G5 root disk mounted read-only on boot and boot fails" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818177

 16:26:48 <smoser> they told him "hardware failure"

 16:27:08 <smoser> Daviey, smoser there are udev issues in the ramdisk.

 16:27:13 <smoser> this is unfortunately nothing new.

 16:27:24 <Daviey> ugh

 16:28:04 <smoser> at least my personal feeling is that several of the "rarely does not boot" bugs are a result of udev not behaving correctly.

 16:28:07 <Daviey> smb: What server related kernel things do you think are viable to land before kernel freeze?

 16:28:27 <Daviey> lol

 16:28:51 <SpamapS> smoser: seems to be most often triggered by very high end storage

 16:29:00 <Daviey> So yes, what else do you think you can land as of 5 days ago? :)

 16:29:08 <smb> Daviey, Not sure that I got anything that is close pending atm

 16:29:09 <smoser> smb, i've just been asked for bug 761809. i would like to have that landed for oneiric.

 16:29:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 761809 in linux (Ubuntu) "Quota modules are missing from the package" [Undecided,Expired] https://launchpad.net/bugs/761809

 16:29:33 <smb> smoser, Is that the virtual package?

 16:29:39 <smoser> yes.

 16:29:51 <adam_g> SpamapS: negative. i hit bug #818177 anytime LVM xists ontop of my low end commodity  stuff

 16:29:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 818177 in udev (Ubuntu) "HP DL380G5 root disk mounted read-only on boot and boot fails" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/818177

 16:29:58 <Daviey> yes

 16:30:19 <smb> smoser, apw has been working on having an extra package with all the other stuff. Would that be enough?

 16:30:33 <Daviey> smb: ogasawara added the aufs kernel module to the virtual package recently, seems we need a repeat

 16:30:50 <smoser> adam_g, SpamapS well some less common ratio of processor:disk-speed:disk-turn-on speed

 16:30:59 <Daviey> \o/

 16:30:59 <Daviey> we didn't know that

 16:31:17 <ogasawara> Daviey, smb: that was prior to the extras virtual package existing

 16:31:22 <smoser> smb, well that would in fact be good. but he told me to go jump in a lake once before.

 16:31:27 <smoser> when i asked for that.

 16:31:33 <smoser> would that land in oneiric ? smb?

 16:31:44 <smoser> oh. ogasawara is it *in* oneiric ?

 16:31:45 <smb> ogasawara, I think its checkid in now, right?

 16:31:53 * smoser gets a clue

 16:31:53 <smb> checked-in*

 16:32:12 <apw> it is fix committed but not uploaded yes

 16:32:18 <ogasawara> smb: yep, committed.  not uploaded.

 16:32:32 <smoser> apw, that rocks.

 16:33:02 <SpamapS> So sounds like we need to do some intense race hunting in the initrd

 16:33:30 <smoser> since i have the kernel team here

 16:33:33 <ogasawara> smb: we have a 1 week window between beta-2 and final freeze that I'm going to plan one final kernel upload (pending approval from the release team)

 16:33:44 <smoser> do you think that that bug above would be acceptable for a lucid SRU ?

 16:33:46 <smb> Sounds a bit with the hint about a combination of lvm and slow disk...

 16:33:47 <ogasawara> smb: so if we need to add anything, best to do it now.

 16:34:11 <smoser> i'm asked by gondai in ubuntu-server.  ie, could we sru inclusion of -virtual modules for quota

 16:34:17 <smb> smoser, Which of the above being Lucid?

 16:34:33 <smoser> bug

 16:34:35 <smb> ogasawara, I understand if we have the extra package there is things ok

 16:34:55 <smoser> bug 761809

 16:34:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 761809 in linux (Ubuntu) "Quota modules are missing from the package" [Undecided,Expired] https://launchpad.net/bugs/761809

 16:34:59 <smoser> is what i was talking about.

 16:35:20 <smb> Oh so those are missing in lucid

 16:35:50 <smb> Probably there an inclusion of the modules is simpler

 16:36:16 <smoser> right.

 16:36:22 <smoser> i absolutely agree, but we could get that done ?

 16:36:40 <smb> yes

 16:36:45 <smoser> apw, you recently marked the task for "investigate missing modules" as DONE

 16:36:50 <smoser> did you add/remove anythign ?

 16:37:10 <apw> smoser, i don't recognise that WI title ...

 16:37:18 <smoser> looking

 16:37:27 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-kernel-o-version-and-flavours

 16:37:32 <smoser> [apw] Investigate pulling 'excluded' modules for -virtual into a new binary package/udebs: DONE

 16:37:38 <smb> Think that was the one assigned to me and more of a for oneirc thing

 16:37:55 <smb> which we stopped when having the extras for that

 16:37:59 <apw> smoser, yes that is the one which triggered the -extras pacage

 16:38:31 <smoser> so is -extras *everything* such that -virtual + -virtual-extras == -server ?

 16:38:51 <apw> smoser, -virtual != -server, but other than that yes

 16:38:55 <smb> smoser, There still is a difference in what is compiled in

 16:39:11 <smb> (at least)

 16:39:15 <smoser> yeah. ok.

 16:39:30 <apw> the main difference is things like xeny-ness, otherwise we'd tell you to install -server

 16:39:37 <smoser> so i would consider all future bugs of "give me this module in -virtual" much lower priority

 16:39:41 <smoser> but still sometimes valid

 16:39:58 <smoser> ie, the aufs module and such, should be in -virtual and not require the additional 100MB of stuff

 16:40:01 <smoser> anyway

 16:40:06 <apw> smoser, you'll have to try even harder to convince us to let them in, we'll likely want to take things out to slim things down

 16:40:11 <smoser> i think we've beaten this.

 16:40:24 <smoser> apw, right.

 16:40:26 <smoser> i like it

 16:40:28 <smoser> thank you.

 16:40:37 <smoser> that brings us to

 16:40:40 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

 16:40:43 <smoser> NCommander, around ?

 16:41:02 <smoser> i believe that utlemming has made some recent progress around arm

 16:41:05 <smoser> and maybe even zul

 16:41:09 <smoser> just if you wanted to brag a bit

 16:41:12 <Daviey> and rbasak

 16:41:16 <zul> smoser: im good

 16:41:25 <smoser> i'll brag for utlemming

 16:41:33 <smoser> because i think it is seriously cool

 16:41:34 <Daviey> NCommander: When you read this, please can you explain why you are unable to attend this slot?

 16:41:55 <smoser> you can now download our cloud-images from http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com and they will "just work" under qemu arm

 16:42:03 <jamespage> w00t

 16:42:12 <smoser> so if you want to just see an arm thing run, you can.

 16:42:19 <Ursinha> that's cool

 16:42:27 <smoser> yes.

 16:42:30 <rbasak> great!

 16:42:43 <smoser> ok.

 16:42:44 <smoser> moving on

 16:42:50 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

 16:43:01 <Daviey> zul: How is openstack on arm looking?

 16:43:17 <zul> Daviey: uh...good

 16:43:35 <Daviey> How is our fine community looking?

 16:43:43 <Daviey> (Please don't all answer at once)

 16:43:56 * zul watches tumbleweeds go one by

 16:44:10 <utlemming> smoser: the arm qemu images are actually broken due to a kernel bug

 16:44:18 <smoser> boooo

 16:44:22 <Daviey> :(

 16:44:23 <utlemming> smoser: the fix has been committed, but the latest images don't have the kernel fix

 16:44:56 <apw> utlemming, which bug ... so i can add it to the 'why we want to upload' list, and for which branch

 16:45:13 <utlemming> sure...give me a minute to look it up

 16:45:34 <utlemming> a working qemu image can be fetched from http://people.canonical.com/~ben/images/arm.img.gz for those who want to play with one that is about a week old.

 16:46:05 <utlemming> Bug #852225

 16:46:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 852225 in linux (Ubuntu Oneiric) "ARM kernel writing 32bits to 16 bit register" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/852225

 16:46:24 <rbasak> That's a great bug title :)

 16:46:36 <smb> Think that one went into master

 16:46:56 <Daviey> Oneiric SRU?

 16:47:16 <smb> Daviey, Close to release. You have to really argue now

 16:47:24 <Daviey> smb: nah

 16:47:29 <smoser> "doesn't boot"

 16:47:45 <apw> ogasawara, ^^ that lends weight to your upload argument

 16:47:58 <ogasawara> apw: indeed.  /me makes a note.

 16:48:05 <utlemming> it only affects qemu though

 16:48:06 <Daviey> The arm cloud images are not part of the offical release this cycle, unless i am mistaken.

 16:48:21 <Daviey> If they get fixed post release as an SRU, seems reasonable

 16:48:23 <smb> Daviey, Mainly its a switch to not just dump stuff in but to already switch over to a more stable more with reviewing things

 16:48:33 <apw> but they are important

 16:48:59 <smoser> well, we will let ogasawara argue that appropriately. it seems we have good representation, and i trust the participants.

 16:49:01 <smoser> lets move on

 16:49:06 <Daviey> +1

 16:49:08 <Daviey> can we go home?

 16:49:09 <smoser> i am winning for longest meeting in quite some time.

 16:49:22 <smoser> [TOPIC] Open Discussion

 16:49:31 <zul> i like turnips

 16:49:36 <SpamapS> +1

 16:49:48 <Ursinha> lol

 16:49:49 <jamespage> I'm a swede man myself

 16:50:01 <AlanBell> Daviey: fix committed

 16:50:02 <SpamapS> I was reading the launchpad-dev mailing list yesterday, and I saw that they have a very interesting triage process... they do not use Medium as a priority.

 16:50:04 <Daviey> Thanks for your input Serge

 16:50:24 <Ursinha> SpamapS, yes, that discussion is indeed really interesting

 16:50:41 <smoser> SpamapS, a link would be helpful

 16:50:42 <SpamapS> Critical means it has to be worked on now. High means it has to be worked on Next. Everything else is Low

 16:50:58 <Daviey> We are /close/ to that.

 16:51:27 <Daviey> Medium is almost the 'next' High stuff.

 16:51:32 <Ursinha> they're discussing possibly using high and medium as they almost don't do that today

 16:51:57 <SpamapS> I'd give you a link but the archive seems 2 days behind.

 16:52:03 <Ursinha> Daviey, that's how I see it too.

 16:52:37 <smoser> moving on then.

 16:52:43 <rbasak> I got the impression that Low means probably will never be worked on unless someone has a specific interest, and Medium is the general work queue

 16:53:04 <rbasak> (from being new to the process on the server team, not launchpad-dev)

 16:53:17 <smoser> i would agree with rbasak .

 16:53:22 <smoser> i really dont think its all that important

 16:53:25 <Daviey> rbasak: yeah.

 16:53:33 <Daviey> Crticial means, panic - all hands on deck.

 16:53:44 <SpamapS> Anyway, our Medium queue just for triage is massive.. and I feel like we should look at being honest that we may not ever get to it, so its a Low issue in our *work* priority.

 16:54:00 <Daviey> smoser: you don't think the importance is importiant?

 16:54:12 <SpamapS> Daviey: he gives it a Low priority is all

 16:54:19 <smoser> i would give imprtance a 'low' importance

 16:54:26 <Daviey> Anyway, you don't have to use the full hour for the meeting btw.

 16:54:35 <smoser> i'm not kidding.

 16:54:44 <smoser> we need some way to flag stuff that really matters.

 16:54:56 <smoser> currently that is either 'critical' or getting it onto Daviey's list

 16:54:57 <rbasak> smoser: as long as importance gets set, so critical stuff is separated out quick

 16:54:59 <SpamapS> smoser: High is just that.

 16:54:59 <Daviey> end meeting?

 16:55:15 <smoser> SpamapS, so what are we discussing ?

 16:55:44 <smoser> i work on bugs that are quite reasonably 'Low' before i work on ones that are 'High' at times.

 16:55:47 <SpamapS> pushing most things we'd normally say are "Medium" down to Low and possibly reviewing the queue more often to put them in Won't Fix status.

 16:56:03 <smoser> the key point above was that if someone thinks it needs fixing and works on it it will get fixed.

 16:56:16 <smoser> i'll agree with "wont fix"

 16:56:20 <smoser> but daviey wants to go home

 16:56:25 <smoser> so i'm not giving any more fuel to the fire

 16:56:33 <smoser> [TOPIC] Announce next meeting date and time

 16:56:44 <smoser> Tuesday 2011-09-27 at 16:00 UTC

 16:57:04 <smoser> SpamapS, Ursinha i do apologize for not giving you as much time as you wanted.

 16:57:09 <smoser> but i really do think that everyone wants to go

 16:57:11 <Ursinha> that's ok

 16:57:30 <smoser> and i think we have another meeting scheduled next week, with another open discussion section next week.

 16:57:38 <smoser> #endmeeting
