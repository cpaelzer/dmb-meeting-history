 21:00:41 <pleia2> [LINK] http://ubuntuone.com/7JTEZG0YScFj9mliRJPcCI

 21:00:46 <pleia2> oh

 21:00:50 <pleia2> #link http://ubuntuone.com/7JTEZG0YScFj9mliRJPcCI

 21:00:56 <pleia2> I don't know how this new bot works :)

 21:00:59 <jono> :-)

 21:01:07 <jono> so do we want to review the findings in the doc?

 21:01:19 <pleia2> sounds good, I read through it earlier

 21:01:24 <jono> cool

 21:01:26 * dholbach too

 21:01:30 <jono> I summarized the key themes on the last page

 21:01:37 <pleia2> #topic Membership Survey

 21:01:40 <jono> I think these are interesting areas of focus and discussion

 21:01:49 <pleia2> this is the Community Council meeting btw :)

 21:02:02 <pleia2> jono: thanks so much for working on this, it was a very good report

 21:02:03 <jono> yup

 21:02:08 <jono> thanks pleia2

 21:02:16 <jono> I think it is interesting to see the feedback

 21:02:29 <jono> I am pleased that generally the feedback was very positive about the membership process

 21:02:31 <mako> ciao

 21:02:36 <jono> hey mako

 21:02:54 <jono> mako, we are looking at the membership survey report

 21:02:55 <jono> http://ubuntuone.com/7JTEZG0YScFj9mliRJPcCI

 21:03:34 <jono> the key resonating piece of confusion seemed to be about expectations about what constitutes membership

 21:03:53 <jono> I was wondering if we could look at the areas of participation in the survey and provides examples for the most popular areas

 21:04:13 <pleia2> page 5?

 21:04:40 <jono> pleia2, exactly

 21:04:46 <pleia2> jono: and did this go to developer membership board folks too, or just from the regional boards?

 21:04:50 <jono> maybe https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership could provide subpages with examples of such contributions

 21:04:54 <jono> pleia2, I blogged it

 21:04:59 <jono> ohj sorry

 21:05:02 <jono> I see what you mean

 21:05:07 <dholbach> in addition to that I think it might be interesting to review together with RMBs/DMB the cases that didn't seem to fit in and see where we can be clearer or amend expectations

 21:05:37 <jono> pleia2, I asked Jorge to provide a list of all names that have been through the membership process, I think it was mainly regional boards

 21:05:42 <jono> dholbach, agreed

 21:05:59 <jono> it seems though the expectations issue likely is where is particularly applies to DMB applications

 21:06:06 <highvoltage> jono: I read it this morning, it was nice to see the possitive feedback!

 21:06:07 <jono> e.g. upstream contributions

 21:06:12 <jono> highvoltage, :-)

 21:06:36 <jono> maybe we could ask the various membership boards to flesh out examples of what is considered good work in each of those areas

 21:06:45 <jono> e.g. locos, translations, docs, packaging, upstream contributions etc

 21:06:49 <pleia2> I also noticed that some people felt technical things weren't valued as highly as community, and I think that is because in some cases people went to the wrong board (regional when they're doing packaging work, for instance)

 21:06:59 <pleia2> and there was general confusion about which board to go to

 21:07:00 <jono> pleia2, right

 21:07:34 * micahg wonders why people aren't warned about this before the meeting in question

 21:07:51 <jono> micahg, warned about what?

 21:07:59 <micahg> applying for the wrong board

 21:08:02 <dholbach> I think I recall a similar discussion some months ago - if I remember correctly the outcome was something like "all membership boards should be able to make a good decision or ask other people for advice"

 21:08:04 <jono> ahhh I see

 21:08:22 <pleia2> micahg: it's very common for wiki pages to be incomplete so the board depends upon the meeting conversation to get more details about where their involvement is, short answer: we don't know before the meeting

 21:08:43 <micahg> pleia2: ah, ok

 21:09:05 <highvoltage> indeed, RMB can do technical applicants as well. packaging-only contributors are a bit special though and it would probably be more fair to them to apply via the DMB.

 21:09:13 <dholbach> what we should stress in the documentation in any case is to explain the relevance of your work for Ubuntu

 21:09:47 <jono> so would you folks be happy to participate in us listing common areas of work (e.g. locos, docs, translations) and for each area list examples of what is considered good work

 21:09:57 <jono> I think this could help better communicate what is considered good work

 21:10:43 <pleia2> sounds good, should probably put these examples on a separate wiki page though, /Membership is getting a bit long :)

 21:11:16 <pleia2> (it's also worth noting that we've improved /Membership *a lot* in the past two years to address some of the concerns raised in the survey)

 21:11:22 <jono> agreed

 21:11:28 <jono> awesome

 21:11:32 <dholbach> that would help in many cases, I guess - I'm wondering how prone this approach would be to leaving out other kinds of activity

 21:11:36 * micahg would also suggest making it clear these are examples and not checklists

 21:11:44 <pleia2> micahg: agreed

 21:11:44 <highvoltage> and the issue of upstream contributions have also been cleared up heavily since the survey

 21:11:47 <jono> ok, I will take an action to set up the pages and then mail the RMBs for input

 21:11:55 <jono> maybe then the CC can review this content?

 21:12:03 <dholbach> sure, I'm happy to help with that

 21:12:04 <pleia2> jono: sounds good

 21:12:14 <jono> how do I register an action again?

 21:12:18 <jono> I am so useless with bots

 21:12:19 <jono> lol

 21:12:29 <pleia2> #action jono to set up the pages and then mail the RMBs for input

 21:12:29 * meetingology jono to set up the pages and then mail the RMBs for input

 21:12:30 <DarkwingDuck> I think if we take the areas that each regional board looks at and lists those, then we wont be leaving anything out... Or, it will limit it.

 21:12:33 <popey> sorry I'm late

 21:12:35 <jono> awesome

 21:12:47 <dholbach> hey popey

 21:12:48 <jono> popey, fired

 21:12:49 <jono> lol

 21:12:53 <popey> wooot

 21:13:04 <mako> so, there's one very clear way we can address issues of expectations before meetings

 21:13:36 <jono> mako, oh?

 21:13:38 <mako> which is to actively encourage members leaving testimonials to give concrete feedback on the completeness of an applicdation

 21:13:59 <mako> presumably, every person who has been through this process has some idea of what is expected

 21:14:08 <mako> and they are all actually looking at the page in question

 21:14:49 <mako> we can change the documentation to suggest that member candidates ask people they ask for testimonials for advice in the process

 21:15:01 <dholbach> good thinking

 21:15:01 <jono> that makes sense

 21:15:13 <mako> or to even require that testimonials only be left on applications that members feel are complete enough to have a chance of passing! (although that might be heavy handed)

 21:15:53 <mako> there are a few ways that we can rephrase core parts of the process documents to encourage more feedback from the members who are already involved in the process before even the very incomplete applicdations make it to the meetings

 21:16:05 <jono> I think this makes great sense

 21:16:11 <jono> popey, pleia2 thoughts?

 21:16:28 <mako> i've also tended to think of large majority of rejections/come-back-laters as failures in documentation or communication on our part

 21:16:31 <popey> I have nothing to add

 21:16:36 <pleia2> I think it would be tricky to make this happen, people are busy and writing a testimonial at all takes time without also committing to doing a review of the application

 21:16:41 <pleia2> we can certainly encourage it though

 21:16:51 <popey> however I do think the whole membership thing is opaque to many

 21:17:01 <pleia2> (I offer suggestions on apps pretty frequently)

 21:17:03 <jono> so maybe we should add it to the docs as a form of encouragement

 21:17:08 <jono> popey, really?

 21:17:10 <popey> I announced on G+ that Tony was now a member and one reply was "what did he use before?"

 21:17:25 <popey> but thats from people outside the community

 21:17:34 <jono> popey, that is understandable outside of Ubuntu

 21:17:34 <popey> not understanding what membership means to people in the community

 21:18:13 <popey> I still think there's room for a 30 second elevator pitch at the top of the membership page as to what membership actually means

 21:18:17 <popey> !membership

 21:18:18 <ubottu> Ubuntu Membership means recognition of a significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu and the Ubuntu community.  For more info see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership

 21:18:25 <jono> mako could you add that clarification to the docs to encourage reviewing apps from testimonials

 21:18:26 <popey> tl;dr

 21:18:41 <jono> popey, makes sense

 21:18:54 <popey> but thats a minor point :D

 21:19:07 <mako> i think that the fact that 17% of the people who end up being members either apply with incomplete information or two early is a concrete number we work to reduce

 21:19:12 <jono> popey,  could you write that and add it to the page

 21:19:21 <popey> i could try

 21:19:25 <jono> popey, cool

 21:19:26 <mako> i think we if we improve the relevant documentations, we can cut this is half

 21:19:29 <popey> action me!

 21:19:35 <mako> jono: sure, i'm happy to help with that :)

 21:19:41 <jono> thanks mako

 21:20:14 <pleia2> #action mako to add clarification to docs to encourage reviewing apps from testimonials

 21:20:14 * meetingology mako to add clarification to docs to encourage reviewing apps from testimonials

 21:20:16 <jono> #action popey add elevator pitch to Membership page summarizing the purpose and function of membership

 21:20:16 * meetingology popey add elevator pitch to Membership page summarizing the purpose and function of membership

 21:20:41 <pleia2> it's also worth noting that the membership boards have a mailing list that people can email to ask us about membership if they have any questions

 21:21:09 <pleia2> I think people don't know about it, or they're shy to ask, or don't know they can ask

 21:21:09 <jono> indeed

 21:21:15 <jono> is that clear to people who apply?

 21:21:32 <dholbach> if that's not in the docs, we should add it, or maybe make it more prominent :)

 21:21:56 <jono> would you be happy to do that dholbach?

 21:22:02 <pleia2> the bottom of each regional page has "If you have questions or wish to give private testimonials email ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com (your message may initially be held for moderation)"

 21:22:05 <jono> ensure the list is seen as a prominent for of support?

 21:22:12 <jono> in the docs

 21:22:17 <dholbach> pleia2, that should be good enough :)

 21:22:22 <jono> oh cool

 21:22:23 <pleia2> but it's not on /Membership and doesn't exactly scream "we can help you out!"

 21:22:31 <dholbach> ok

 21:22:35 <dholbach> I'll take care of it

 21:22:37 <jono> thanks dholbach

 21:22:48 <jono> #action dholbach raise awareness of the list as a place for support

 21:22:48 * meetingology dholbach raise awareness of the list as a place for support

 21:23:00 <jono> so I would like to discuss the meetings feedback

 21:23:19 <jono> there were two primary areas of concern here - the timliness of getting to applications and quorum

 21:23:29 <jono> maybe lets look at timeliness first

 21:23:59 <jono> is there a limit on how apps happen in each meeting?

 21:24:08 <popey> not for EMEA

 21:24:09 <pleia2> EMEA and Americas do fine with quorum, and the CC just added 3 additoinal members to Asia Pacific so hopefully that won't be an issue moving forward (I'm working with APAC on this as I can)

 21:24:26 <jono> pleia2, awesome

 21:24:31 <popey> I dont see a breakdown on which board has timeliness issues?

 21:24:33 <pleia2> not for Americas either, we don't have a problem getting through our list

 21:24:40 <jono> popey, it was general feedback

 21:24:47 <jono> no specific board was highlighted

 21:24:51 <dholbach> how do you feel about having meetings regardless of quorum or not and chasing up additional votes by email afterwards?

 21:24:58 <jono> dholbach, +1

 21:25:11 <pleia2> dholbach: yeah, I think we need to take that into consideration

 21:25:12 <popey> its rarely been an issue for EMEA

 21:25:17 <jono> I think the idea of folks showing up for approval and meeting doesn't go ahead because of quorum is not good

 21:25:20 <highvoltage> jono: now and again EMEA runs a bit late, which usually steps into CC meeting space, but so far CC has never complained about it and when it has run late it hasn't been by more than 15 minutes or so

 21:25:20 <popey> but I'd be happy to do that

 21:25:29 <popey> but the problem with it is it puts people on hold

 21:25:30 <pleia2> the trouble with Asia Pacific is that it's such a huge area (almost half the world!)

 21:25:45 <pleia2> so getting quorum at a specific time is tricky

 21:25:48 <dholbach> popey, meetings without quorum put them on hold as well :-P

 21:25:50 <jono> popey, it does, but canceling meetings because of lack of quorum puts an application in limbo

 21:25:50 <popey> turning up to meetings people have an expectation set that they'll find out immediately

 21:25:58 <popey> i disagree

 21:25:59 <jono> at least if we move to mail the application can continue

 21:26:17 <popey> lack of quorum and no meeting are similar state, the person didnt get to have their say

 21:26:26 <jono> popey, I disagree:

 21:26:39 <popey> but to have the meeting and then say "you'll have to wait for your answer" is different

 21:26:40 <jono> if a person shows up and no quorum - there is no meeting and nothing happens

 21:26:48 <dholbach> I personally would welcome a "let's talk about it now and we'll get back to you with a decision" as I had a chance to reply to questions as opposed to being told "come back in two weeks"

 21:26:59 <pleia2> dholbach: +1

 21:27:09 <dholbach> but maybe that's just me

 21:27:11 <dholbach> ...and pleia2

 21:27:17 <jono> if we change it where there is no quorum and the present members vote and the remaining votes are offered over email, the applicant can be informed that the app is still being processed

 21:27:32 <jono> dholbach, +1

 21:27:37 <popey> which was my point, it puts people on hod

 21:27:37 <pleia2> people sometimes bring along their peers on ubuntu projects to cheer for them, it's very discouraging when you bring people along and no meeting happens, at least they could introduce themselves and get their cheers in

 21:27:39 <popey> *hold

 21:27:57 <Laney> FYI we did that with the last DMB meeting and it was a right pain to chase people to vote

 21:28:02 <jono> popey, but they are not on hold, it is just continuing as opposed to them showing up to a meeting for it to be  a waste of time

 21:28:05 <popey> at least via email the people who complete the quourm can see the log of people turning up and cheering I suppose

 21:28:13 <jono> Laney, interesting

 21:28:15 <popey> we're splitting hairs

 21:28:18 <micahg> well, given that pleia2 said some applicants don't have complete applications, it's hard to know in advance what questions need to be asked even if one can't be present, perhaps a requirement that an application must be complete to be processed w/out quorum (as a followup)

 21:28:28 <Laney> which is why we moved away from email stuff in the first place

 21:28:54 <jono> ok so the other option is that we always strive maintain quoum

 21:28:59 <stgraber> Laney: +1 (and thanks again for handling it ;))

 21:29:01 <jono> additional board members could solve that

 21:29:17 <popey> we dont exactly have people falling out of the sky to be on boards

 21:29:31 <jono> popey, do you have another idea in which we can secure a quorum?

 21:29:40 <pleia2> asia pacific hasn't had a meeting since we added the new members, and they were the only board really having problems

 21:29:47 <popey> yes, get people from other boards

 21:29:48 <pleia2> I think we should see how things go with their new members and take it from there

 21:29:53 <popey> I have suggested this previously, and it does work

 21:29:54 <Laney> I still think going ahead was the right decision though

 21:29:55 <jono> popey, which boards?

 21:30:01 <jono> other membership boards?

 21:30:01 <Laney> better then leaving people hanging after they've turned up

 21:30:04 <popey> yes

 21:30:14 <jono> makes sense

 21:30:18 <popey> I have stood in for members of US and Asia boards on more than one occasion

 21:30:27 <popey> because I happened to be online and saw in -meeting that there was no quoum

 21:30:36 <jono> popey, that makes sense

 21:30:42 <popey> and subsequently (months later) people from those boards rememebr that and ping me directly

 21:30:55 <popey> this is why we post reminders to the membership boards list

 21:30:56 <pleia2> the CC has pretty much said this was ok

 21:30:59 <popey> its why we have only one list

 21:31:37 <popey> so we can say "Hey, emea meeting tomorrow" and when someone says "can't make it, we wont be quorum" we can have an opportunity (albeit at short notice) to get someone to stand in

 21:31:55 <jono> popey, do you feel all boards are aware that this is what they should do if there is no quorum?

 21:32:06 <popey> I think they're aware that its possible

 21:32:13 <popey> i dont think they believe it's policy

 21:32:17 <popey> because it isnt really

 21:32:26 <popey> its members of a board doing a favour for members of another board

 21:32:37 <pleia2> and the CC has said it's ok

 21:32:37 <popey> informally, and on best-endeavour basis

 21:32:38 <jono> maybe we can formalize this as a policy

 21:33:01 <jono> should it only apply to RMBs or any governor who is equipped to approve membership

 21:33:10 <jono> so if there is DMB member for example they could step in

 21:33:11 <popey> tricky

 21:33:14 <pleia2> it really should not be something that's used regularly

 21:33:22 <jono> pleia2, agreed

 21:33:32 <pleia2> if a board regularly has trouble getting quorum we need to address that directly (like we just have with APAC)

 21:33:40 <jono> pleia2, agree

 21:33:58 <popey> exactly

 21:34:08 <jono> so maybe we should formalize as a policy and communicate to all RMBs that this used if quorum cannot be made, but should be used only when absolutely required

 21:34:11 <pleia2> I think we'll be ok once we get asia pacific back on track, they are the board that really has struggled the most with this

 21:34:18 <popey> but (for example) I would have no problem asking someone like jussi or laney from irc or dmb to step in if they could.

 21:34:42 <popey> it's not like we're asking a welder to do brain surgery, I'm pretty sure we're all on roughly the same page when it comes to what's expected of a member?

 21:34:50 <popey> however!

 21:34:54 <jono> agreed

 21:34:57 <popey> I don't think it works the other way round

 21:35:01 <jono> yes

 21:35:03 <popey> I wouldn't want to stand in on the DMB

 21:35:06 <jono> this is a one way thing

 21:35:07 <pleia2> yeah, I can't judge irc membership

 21:35:11 <micahg> popey: +1

 21:35:20 <Laney> I can't techincally add people to ~ubuntumembers though

 21:35:26 <popey> others can tho

 21:35:29 <jono> ok, popey would you be happy to mail all the RMBs to ensure they are aware of this workflow if quorum is not met?

 21:35:34 <popey> we're not asking the entire dmb to step in :D

 21:35:35 <Laney> just saying that launchpad doesn't think I have this authority

 21:35:38 <pleia2> yeah, presumably the *whole* board wouldn't be MIA for a meeting :)

 21:35:57 <popey> I hear Fedora have some Ambassadors, we could get them to stand in!

 21:36:05 <popey> yes jono

 21:36:08 <jono> thanks popey

 21:36:14 <popey> action me up

 21:36:31 * meetingology popey mail RMBs about lack of quorum workflow

 21:36:39 <head_victim> As one of the new members of AsiaOceania I'd just like to throw a quick comment that I am finding it difficult to find any documentation on policy. I know we're here to decide on membership applications but the details of how we achieve that all seem to be word of mouth and just assumed.

 21:36:42 <Laney> like, if you want that to be possible then make dmb and irc and whatever a member of the team that makes you an admin of ubuntnumembers

 21:36:59 <Laney> then the delegation is clear

 21:36:59 <jono> head_victim, good point

 21:37:05 <head_victim> Sorry to interrupt, just wanted to give a newbies view

 21:37:11 <pleia2> head_victim: please do

 21:37:13 <jono> we don't have a "how to review membership" wiki page, right?

 21:37:22 <pleia2> oh, you said your thing :) thanks

 21:37:32 <popey> not that I know of

 21:37:37 <head_victim> I asked the mailing list as well and got no response either.

 21:37:51 <jono> I think such a page could be useful

 21:38:06 <jono> would someone like to volunteer to put it together?

 21:38:07 <head_victim> Very, especially if us 3 new members all turn up and we're the only ones there.

 21:38:08 <pleia2> head_victim: apologies, I was meaning to reply to that, I have a whole email I send to new americas members

 21:38:27 <pleia2> jono: I have one pretty much written, I'll formalize it

 21:38:29 <head_victim> pleia2: tis ok, I just happened to see this meeting pop up after my night shift so hung around to join in

 21:38:55 <pleia2> #action pleia2 to publish "welcome" document for new board members with policy for approvals

 21:38:55 * meetingology pleia2 to publish "welcome" document for new board members with policy for approvals

 21:39:12 <jono> pleia2, awesome!

 21:39:17 <dholbach> great

 21:39:20 <popey> win

 21:39:21 <head_victim> Thanks everyone

 21:39:29 <jono> I think this covers many of the key areas

 21:39:45 <jono> maybe we should focus on these actions first

 21:39:49 <jono> and then review in another meeting?

 21:39:59 <dholbach> or at UDS

 21:40:05 <jono> dholbach, good idea

 21:40:09 <pleia2> sounds good

 21:40:20 <dholbach> I'll add it to my TODO list to schedule such a session

 21:40:25 <pleia2> thanks dholbach

 21:40:41 <jono> awesome

 21:40:44 <Laney> we should make sure this document leaves room for interpretation

 21:41:01 <popey> +1

 21:41:18 <jono> alright

 21:41:20 <jono> are we done?

 21:41:25 <pleia2> highvoltage: still about? was your "Defining what upstream contributions are in terms of membership" agenda item sufficiently discussed this past month? (I didn't want to just remove it without asking)

 21:41:58 <pleia2> I think it was, just need to be sure we don't have loose ends that we need to take care of or document

 21:42:10 <pleia2> aside from what we've already discussed today, of course

 21:42:58 <highvoltage> pleia2: it was, I can't find the link to it though (been looking for it for dholbach)

 21:43:13 <Laney> highvoltage: a summary would be nice

 21:43:28 <geser> is this documented somewhere which upstream contribution count for Ubuntu membership?

 21:43:56 <highvoltage> Laney: the outcome was basically that upstream contributions do count if it affect ubuntu significantly (maybe not exact workding, but that's basically it in concept)

 21:44:43 <highvoltage> Laney: I believe the plan is to take more tricky applications on a case-by-case basis until there is more convention to document

 21:44:57 <pleia2> since we're giving examples of work in loco teams and such that counts, I think we should add upstream as a category of contributions that we can give examples of

 21:45:01 <dholbach> that sounds reasonable to me ... if the relevance is clearly enough described in the application (I was not part of that last meeting)

 21:45:26 <highvoltage> http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/713 gives some more background on sabdfl's view on it, which I think is reasonable

 21:46:06 <pleia2> ok, I tihnk we can wrap up then :)

 21:46:09 <pleia2> thanks highvoltage

 21:46:17 <jono> thanks everyone!

 21:46:40 <pleia2> #endmeeting
