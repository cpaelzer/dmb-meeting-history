 20:16:59 <flomincucci> *leogg

 20:17:02 <unimix> the most important events were Ubucon 2010 and the two edition of CISL with gov support

 20:17:07 <juancarlospaco> hello flomin

 20:17:24 <leogg> flomincucci, o/

 20:17:26 <unimix> among others

 20:17:49 <leogg> unimix, nice

 20:18:10 <leogg> unimix, I didn't see any team reports on the app?

 20:18:17 <huats> how do you coordinate your team since argentina is large country ?

 20:18:37 <huats> please answer leogg first

 20:19:19 <leogg> :)

 20:19:53 <huats> any answer ?

 20:19:58 <unimix> ok, I have done team reports in irregular basis, but the last months are uo to date

 20:20:18 <unimix> s/uo/up

 20:21:20 <huats> ok

 20:21:37 <huats> unimix, what about my question on the coordination in your team?

 20:21:54 <unimix> we have main activities in Buenos Aires and use the mailing list to coordinate and encourage the other to make events in the rest of the country

 20:22:19 <huats> ok

 20:22:33 <leogg> unimix, I can only fin https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARGENTINA/TeamReports

 20:22:43 <leogg> s/fin/find

 20:23:43 <huats> leogg, I have found the august/september/october on too

 20:23:44 <paultag> sorry I'm late

 20:23:49 <unimix> leogg, there are thre months of team reports at least i have done by myself

 20:24:09 <unimix> thats right leogg

 20:25:28 <unimix> there are some othe reports for 2010, for sure

 20:25:38 <leogg> unimix, you should spend some time on reporting, otherwise it's difficult to see what you guys been doing

 20:26:14 <leogg> unimix, for example, there's a lot of events in 2009 and 2010, but I don't see much activity in 2011

 20:26:59 <_stink_> i have to jet, but i want to make sure i say that i'm a member of ubuntu-us-mi (which is up next) and i am overflowing with wub for ubuntu-us-mi.  please excuse my out of turn wub.

 20:27:06 <unimix> ok, leogg, that's my fault cause i'm in charge of that task.

 20:27:12 <paultag> _stink_: noted :)

 20:27:30 <paultag> _stink_: go bucks!

 20:27:52 <leogg> unimix, you should delegate :)

 20:28:01 <paultag> leogg++

 20:28:07 <_stink_> paultag: i'll just ask Nebraska about that here... :D

 20:28:07 <leogg> unimix, there are other active members on your loco?

 20:28:08 <unimix> leogg, yeap

 20:28:19 <paultag> _stink_: oh, burn! :)

 20:28:29 <paultag> unimix: are they here?

 20:28:44 <unimix> yes, leogg, five more

 20:28:52 <juancarlospaco> o/

 20:28:56 <unimix> ubuntu members

 20:29:32 <huats> unimix, I think the question of leogg is that they should step up to show us you are not alone...

 20:30:10 <unimix> huats, i get the point

 20:30:12 <flomincucci> for active members do you mean ubuntu members?

 20:30:14 <marianom> hi there

 20:30:24 <flomincucci> i'm part of the loco, but still not a ubuntu member

 20:30:36 <paultag> all members are encouraged to participate :)

 20:30:38 <juancarlospaco> hello im active member of ubuntu-ar loco

 20:30:45 <huats> flomincucci, active member in the loco are great !

 20:30:52 <leogg> unimix, I think you're an awesome team, but having no recent activity reports doesn't help

 20:30:59 <huats> terrific !

 20:31:03 <marianom> hi leogg, hi paultag, hi again unimix (hi flomincucci and juancarlospaco)

 20:31:10 <paultag> unimix: do you have photos or any sort of documentation of recent events in 2011?

 20:31:13 <paultag> marianom: Hiyya!

 20:31:14 <malev> hello! unimix is not alone

 20:31:22 <leogg> marianom, hey! o/

 20:31:22 <huats> that is what we want to "see" : people supporting there team

 20:31:24 <unimix> leogg, we have the last month done !

 20:32:06 <unimix> paultag, we have a lot of pics, some of them are in the wiki

 20:32:29 <paultag> unimix: would you mind linking us to a few events from like 2-3 differente events from 2011 and why they are special?

 20:32:31 <marianom> we added a couple of pictures from this year events in the application Iguess

 20:32:35 <marianom> let me check

 20:32:48 <juancarlospaco> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArgentinaTeam/ReApprovalApplication

 20:32:56 <juancarlospaco> i see pics there

 20:33:03 <paultag> ah right right

 20:33:30 <paultag> those look like they're from 2010 from the way it's set up

 20:33:38 <unimix> paultag, do you see it ?

 20:33:42 <huats> (the link on the agenda is wrong)

 20:33:54 <paultag> unimix: I see some photos, but again, nothing from 2011

 20:34:19 <paultag> I found them, though

 20:34:22 <marianom> unimix, paultag: there are two photos for the nevet36 in august

 20:34:31 <paultag> (both of them)

 20:34:33 <paultag> marianom: yep, got it

 20:34:35 <marianom> the photos for the piratefest were horrible

 20:34:37 <marianom> sorry

 20:34:44 <paultag> It's OK. I'm ready

 20:34:49 <marianom> there is no one you could tell anything

 20:38:01 <marianom> paultag: +1

 20:38:03 <snap-l> Hello there

 20:38:16 <leogg> hey guys! welcome!

 20:38:18 <paultag> ah, there's craig

 20:38:35 <leogg> so, who's going to tell us about your team?

 20:39:14 <snap-l> I can speak for our team

 20:39:24 <leogg> snap-l, go ahead!

 20:39:31 <snap-l> We're comprised of the state of Michigan, with two centers of major activity

 20:39:40 <snap-l> Metro Detroit, and West Michigan

 20:39:48 <snap-l> West Michigan is headed by brousch

 20:40:02 <paultag> nice, decentralized.

 20:40:08 <snap-l> We've been active now for a while now

 20:40:17 <leogg> very nice indeed

 20:40:32 <snap-l> Our team regularly meets on IRC every day, and at least once a month to discuss loco business

 20:40:33 <pvl1> hello

 20:41:17 <greg-g> we were officially founded way back in 2007

 20:41:18 <snap-l> mostly we socialize on IRC, but have been known to discuss Ubuntu from time to time. ;)

 20:41:23 <paultag> :)

 20:41:34 <leogg> snap-l, what would you say is your teams biggest strenght?

 20:41:35 <snap-l> We originated the Jam concept

 20:42:00 <snap-l> leogg: I'd say our ability to group together and organize

 20:42:18 <snap-l> and also to innovate new ideas

 20:42:32 <greg-g> and cross group work (eg: we work well with many other linux-focused groups in the area)

 20:42:48 <snap-l> greg-g: ++

 20:42:49 <leogg> nice!

 20:43:08 <leogg> ok, let's vote then!

 20:43:18 <snap-l> We work very closely with our local LUG

 20:45:18 <MobileTurkey> I am from PA

 20:45:19 <jedijf> i am here

 20:45:24 <anduril> Im here

 20:45:28 <leogg> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PennsylvaniaTeam/ReapprovalApplication

 20:45:38 <MobileTurkey> pvl1 is also here

 20:45:44 <MobileTurkey> and pleia2

 20:45:55 <leogg> welcome guys!

 20:46:00 <pvl1> +1

 20:46:03 <MobileTurkey> thanks :)

 20:46:05 <leogg> please talk a bit about your team

 20:46:08 <jedijf> Ubuntu PA is great! Philly area is active.

 20:46:25 <jedijf> irc is active. Forums and mailing list have slowed.

 20:46:26 <jedijf> This is probably more to the success of Ubuntu in general;

 20:46:27 <jedijf> less issues/problems and questions.

 20:46:46 <MobileTurkey> we do a fair bit of troubleshooting on the IRC

 20:46:47 <pvl1> yeah the irc is definetly more active than the forum

 20:46:47 <jedijf> Getting the other areas of PA involved in meatspace stuff

 20:46:48 <jedijf> is an ongoing goal.

 20:46:50 <MobileTurkey> just general pointers and tips

 20:47:03 <pvl1> we talk a lot about technologies as well. lots of interesting stuff

 20:47:12 <jedijf> I *love* the unity debate, even if solely for the passion that

 20:47:14 <jedijf> it has brought back. There is no bad press.

 20:47:15 <popey> http://ubuntupennsylvania.org/ <- should that work?

 20:47:15 <MobileTurkey> many seasoned vets as well as some new comers

 20:47:27 <MobileTurkey> yes

 20:47:29 <MobileTurkey> that is our website! :D

 20:47:34 <popey> doesnt work here

 20:47:36 <anduril> loads here

 20:47:45 <MobileTurkey> loads here as well

 20:47:53 <itnet7> Loads for me popey

 20:47:56 <pvl1> i see it

 20:48:01 <popey> bah

 20:48:04 <popey> my stupid isp

 20:48:05 <popey> nvm

 20:48:12 <jedijf> popey just imagine greatness

 20:48:20 * popey imagines ponies

 20:48:21 <itnet7> :-)

 20:48:23 <leogg> jedijf, I have to say that your app is extremely difficult to read, sorry...

 20:48:26 <MobileTurkey> popey: here is google cache http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UIWEWyreZPQJ:ubuntupennsylvania.org/+ubuntu+pa&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

 20:48:30 <popey> leogg: agreed

 20:48:34 <paultag> leogg: yeah, totally

 20:48:37 <itnet7> ponies on trampolines

 20:48:45 <paultag> jedijf: if I might ask, how many people worked on the app?

 20:48:45 <jedijf> leogg: i was trying to make it easy to reference the events

 20:48:52 <paultag> just as a sidenode

 20:48:58 <jedijf> just me

 20:49:02 <paultag> OK

 20:49:19 <jedijf> rather than have vague references and then go to a timeline

 20:49:31 <MobileTurkey> jedijf is our fearless leader...

 20:49:34 <paultag> :)

 20:49:45 <MobileTurkey> :P

 20:49:45 <jedijf> so each reference would show corresponding data

 20:50:04 <paultag> popey: itnet7: huats: anything else?

 20:50:13 <jedijf> and....

 20:50:16 <itnet7> No, I'm ready

 20:50:18 <paultag> we have a few more minutes

 20:50:24 <paultag> and 3 more teams, I think I have an idea

 20:50:34 <jedijf> In the past we were spoiled by having pleia2 do the blogging, photographing,

 20:50:37 <jedijf> and wiki administriva. That is an area that I would like to delegate.

 20:50:49 <paultag> jedijf: I tink looking into that would be wise

 20:51:00 <paultag> popey: huats: ?

 20:51:02 <pleia2> we've been working over the past few months to get all the administrative keys moved over to active, local members (since a bunch of us moved away)

 20:54:54 <leogg> hey magio081 LogicalDream !

 20:55:01 <leogg> tp0x45, o/

 20:55:09 <tp0x45> hi all

 20:55:10 <LogicalDream> Hi all

 20:55:15 <paultag> ok, ubuntu-me - who's the contact?

 20:55:16 <leogg> so, care to tell us about your team?

 20:55:28 <tp0x45> I can be a contact for today: Tomo POpovic

 20:55:52 <tp0x45> we are a team coming from a small but proud nation of 600,000

 20:56:21 <tp0x45> we unofficially exist since 2007 with on and off activities with collaboration with other teams in the region

 20:56:46 <tp0x45> since 2009 we formed a Facebook (I know) group that has been fairly active

 20:56:53 <tp0x45> It has over 100 members now

 20:57:03 <paultag> Cool. How would you use the new-found approved status (if granted it) to help the end-goal of promoting Ubuntu?

 20:57:22 <gib> MIchigan team +1

 20:57:32 <tp0x45> we see it as a big motivational boost, as we just recently started the website, forum, planet, etc

 20:57:39 <paultag> gib: jcastro: a bit late, they already got the +1 :)

 20:57:53 <tp0x45> we are hoping to organize more events such as our recent release party the other day

 20:58:06 <tp0x45> we established a good relationship with university of Montenegro

 20:58:25 <tp0x45> and it just so happened that one of the major local newspaper reported on the event and team activity today

 20:58:38 <tp0x45> http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/u-podgorici-prezentovana-nova-verzija-ubuntu-os-clanak-42896

 20:58:40 <gib> Had to run an errand for the wife.

 20:58:45 <paultag> gib: np :)

 20:58:52 <paultag> tp0x45: that's really cool!

 20:59:09 <leogg> tp0x45, very nice!

 20:59:25 <tp0x45> we have lots of very young mombers and I think would be very cool to have them get more involved and see that our efforts are being recognized

 21:00:05 <tp0x45> we are also trying to educate facebook users to use our forum, site, IRC, etc...

 21:01:10 <paultag> tp0x45: this sounds really cool :)

 21:01:12 <tp0x45> the activities in last 3-4 months were really result of a team work ... and I hope with the approval of the team we will get even more people that were active in past to reactivate again :)

 21:01:37 <LogicalDream> from 2006 when Montenegro got back Independent status , This is the first time that we are officaly applaing for approval

 21:01:38 <leogg> tp0x45, you've done a great job so far, but I think you need a little more experience

 21:01:49 <paultag> +1

 21:02:09 <paultag> I think the work so far is absolutely monumental

 21:02:20 <tp0x45> thanks paultag :)

 21:02:25 <LogicalDream> Tnx

 21:02:31 <paultag> OK. I'm ready to vote

 21:03:01 <huats> The thing is that even with a terrific work like your we like to have an activity on a wide period of time

 21:05:15 <paultag> don't take this the wrong way

 21:05:19 <paultag> because your work is huge

 21:05:24 <paultag> and to get in a newspaper is massive

 21:05:27 <paultag> so keep it up

 21:05:38 <paultag> but I'd personally like to see a bit more activity over a few more months

 21:05:40 <popey> completely agree

 21:05:44 <leogg> tp0x45, LogicalDream, great job! and we really hope to see you guys in a couple of months

 21:05:51 <itnet7> tp0x45: you all have done great work so far looking forward to the next time you apply

 21:06:11 <tp0x45> thanks!

 21:06:17 <paultag> Ursinha: you're on!

 21:06:18 * Ursinha takes the stage along with Andre_Gondim and Ubuntuser

 21:06:18 <Ursinha> hello #ubuntu-meeting

 21:06:18 <leogg> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BrazilianTeam/ReApprovalApplication2011

 21:06:23 <paultag> howdy!

 21:06:28 <Ursinha> :)

 21:06:33 <paultag> thanks again, tp0x45!

 21:06:34 <Andre_Gondim> hi

 21:06:40 <leogg> LogicalDream, tp0x45, thank you!

 21:06:46 <Ubuntuser> Hi!

 21:06:50 <leogg> hi guys!

 21:06:56 <tp0x45> thank you for good feedback!

 21:07:04 <paultag> let's do this - we're 6 minutes over :)

 21:07:05 <leogg> ubuntu-br, the stage is yours!

 21:07:16 <Ursinha> all right

 21:07:23 <leogg> tp0x45, no problem... just ping us if you need anything

 21:07:30 <Ursinha> Brazil is a *HUGE* country, with 26 states plus the capital (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil :))

 21:07:37 <Ursinha> we are an active Ubuntu community since 2005, and we've been working really hard since last approval to find a way to coordinate and organize all of these people

 21:08:02 <paultag> On the Ubuntu Brazilian Users team on Launchpad we have more than 1431 members, which all of those have signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

 21:08:09 <paultag> Wow, how do you enforce that?

 21:08:14 <popey> wow

 21:08:17 <popey> just. wow.

 21:08:20 <paultag> did you guys translate it? That's really impressive

 21:08:24 <Ursinha> paultag, by having a process that asks users to do that

 21:08:33 <Ursinha> we check pending requests and email them

 21:08:40 <Ursinha> asking them to do so

 21:08:41 <paultag> wow

 21:08:49 <Ursinha> let me find you the link

 21:08:55 <paultag> Ursinha: Do you help them set up a GPG key if they don't know how to use it?

 21:09:12 <Ursinha> paultag, yes

 21:09:20 <Andre_Gondim> paultag, yeah, we have a default mail to learn it

 21:09:22 <Ursinha> there's a canned email to send them

 21:09:30 <Ubuntuser> and wiki too

 21:09:33 <Ursinha> and eventually we have some requests

 21:09:39 <leogg> yep, really impressive

 21:09:39 <Ursinha> paultag, http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/ComoParticipar/MembrosPendentes

 21:09:41 <paultag> gotcha

 21:09:42 <Ursinha> this is the page

 21:09:44 <paultag> thanks Ursinha :)

 21:09:46 <Ursinha> :)

 21:09:55 <leogg> Ursinha, I don't see any team reports?

 21:10:12 <Ursinha> leogg, no, because we haven't got there yet

 21:10:32 <Ursinha> leogg, it's a LOT of people and teams, we're studying how to make all of them talk in a more effective manner

 21:10:35 <Ursinha> without a lot of noise

 21:10:41 <Ursinha> there are 26 groups

 21:11:08 <Ursinha> we consider splitting them per brazilian regions, so we'd have like five teams, that coordinate each one its region

 21:11:10 <paultag> humm

 21:11:24 <leogg> right

 21:11:41 <Ursinha> this is a *HUGE* problem and it's basically the main topic discussed for improvements

 21:11:42 <popey> yeah, can't be easy with such a giant country

 21:11:52 <Ursinha> we have the local teams mailing lists and the national support one

 21:12:10 <Ursinha> we announce things in the national one, things that we carry from the regional lists

 21:12:12 <Ubuntuser> Facebook and Twitter too.. ;)

 21:12:21 <Ursinha> also, Andre_Gondim does an awesome job blogging about the events

 21:12:34 <paultag> and translations (from what I read) - which is mighty awesome work

 21:12:36 <Andre_Gondim> :D

 21:12:45 <leogg> really nice work!

 21:12:45 <Ursinha> paultag, yeah, he's awesome like that :)

 21:12:49 <paultag> :)

 21:13:00 <Ursinha> last years we worked on reviving the existing working groups, and creating new ones, such as the ubuntu-br-artwork and ubuntu-br-dev teams. Still not much activity on them, but we're working on it

 21:13:29 <Ursinha> we wrote "first steps" for people that want to participate with translations or docs or any other teams

 21:13:39 <Ursinha> so it's easier to coordinate across the country

 21:14:03 <huats> Ursinha, coordination on such a big country is clearly a key I think

 21:14:26 <Ursinha> yeah, I was interested in the answer when you asked argentina :)

 21:14:33 <Ursinha> because it's tricky

 21:14:38 <Ursinha> but we're working on it

 21:14:54 <Ursinha> baby steps, but we're WAY better than a few years ago, that's for sure

 21:15:02 <leogg> ok, let's vote then!
