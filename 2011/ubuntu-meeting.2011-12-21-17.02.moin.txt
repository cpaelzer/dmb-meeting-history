 17:02:10 <gema> who is with us today?

 17:02:14 <alourie> o/

 17:02:15 <nuclearbob> I am

 17:02:23 <phillw> o/

 17:02:39 <alourie> I'll try to ping roignac

 17:02:44 <gema> ok, it sounds like we have many people already on holidays

 17:03:04 <gema> let's get started then

 17:03:08 <gema> #topic Previous Actions

 17:03:38 <gema> we had an action on patrick but he is not available today, so I will postpone it again!

 17:04:01 <gema> #action patrickmw to publish a list of launchpad projects that conform our automated testing in jenkins

 17:04:01 * meetingology patrickmw to publish a list of launchpad projects that conform our automated testing in jenkins

 17:04:11 * gema gema to talk to hggdh about some jenkins training for the community

 17:04:35 <gema> I spoke to hggdh and he has organised a training session in one developer event that is happening past mid January

 17:04:55 <gema> I have asked him to send an email to the list but he was going on holidays, so I guess that'll happen next year

 17:05:10 * gema gema to move the standard sru testing blueprint to the end

 17:05:17 <alourie> yea!!

 17:05:22 <gema> I did that on the agenda

 17:05:53 <gema> anything I am missing, anyone?

 17:06:00 <alourie> if we could contribute to anything jenkins oriented, would be great

 17:06:16 <gema> yep, let me get to that later

 17:06:21 <alourie> k

 17:06:30 <gema> #topic Blueprints Update Precise

 17:06:49 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-builds-smoke-testing

 17:06:59 <gema> I have started reviewing the code of our ISO smoke tests and will have some feedback early in January.

 17:07:16 <gema> I am not sure who to send the feedback to, but will figure it out

 17:07:31 <alourie> o/

 17:07:40 <gema> alourie: go ahead

 17:07:56 <alourie> I think that generic stuff like that should go to the list anyway

 17:08:03 <alourie> s/list/maillist

 17:08:18 <gema> yes, I can copy the list about it, but I don't know who is responsible to fix it

 17:08:21 <alourie> and then other channels if necessary

 17:08:21 <alourie> ..

 17:08:23 <alourie> ah

 17:08:25 <alourie> ok

 17:08:44 <gema> I will definitely copy ubuntu-qa whenever I send it

 17:08:50 <alourie> great

 17:08:52 <alourie> thank you

 17:08:59 <gema> no problem

 17:09:02 <roignac> o/

 17:09:07 <gema> roignac: go ahead

 17:09:24 <roignac> you should also include ubuntu-server-iso-testing-dev@lists.launchpad.net

 17:09:43 <roignac> this is a maillist of Ubuntu Server Iso Testing Developers

 17:09:44 <gema> ahh, so those are the people responsible for it, you reckon?

 17:09:48 <gema> ok

 17:09:53 <gema> thanks roignac

 17:10:17 <roignac> i guess so, please include other drivers/maintainers of automated test project (based on info from patrickw)

 17:10:30 <roignac> s/patrickw/patrickmw/

 17:10:35 <gema> yes, will do

 17:10:56 <gema> I am also thinking that they may tell me to fix it myself, I am not sure how these things work

 17:11:01 <gema> but I guess we'll find out

 17:11:28 <gema> we are also looking into modifying the jenkins plugin we installed for the ISO testing dashboard

 17:11:47 <gema> so that it shows the build we are testing, aggregates results, etc

 17:12:09 <gema> we'll let you know if we go ahead with the enhancements, the plan would be to contribute those upstream

 17:12:44 <gema> #subtopic #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-boot-speed-testing

 17:12:57 <gema> too many subtopics, let me try again

 17:13:08 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-boot-speed-testing

 17:13:27 <gema> patrickmw is not here, nuclearbob do you have any update on this?

 17:13:40 <nuclearbob> yeah, we're working on adding architecture to the results now

 17:13:52 <nuclearbob> as part of that we're redoing the directory structure

 17:14:05 <nuclearbob> and we'll be adding some information about deltas on a given day and between days

 17:14:17 <nuclearbob> that's all I've got for now

 17:14:24 <gema> cool, thanks

 17:14:36 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-kernel-sru

 17:14:48 <gema> sconklin is not here either

 17:14:49 <gema> moving on

 17:14:59 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-test-case-management-tool

 17:15:16 <gema> the Mozilla team plan to have the new version of Case Conductor ready for mid January

 17:15:38 <roignac> o/

 17:15:41 <gema> they answered yesterday night to my email and are happy to discuss our requests at some point in January

 17:15:45 <gema> yes, roignac ?

 17:16:09 <roignac> could you please ask them whether we could use cc.oddsites.net and cc-dev.oddsotes.net freely?

 17:16:22 <roignac> As I've taken liberty to create a Ubiquity product

 17:16:26 <gema> I did, they are happy for us to perform our tasks there

 17:16:34 <gema> as long as we don't destroy their testing envs

 17:16:38 <gema> since they are also using it

 17:16:41 <roignac> and later realised that this could break some of their automated tests

 17:16:52 <roignac> oh, ok. No destruction anyway

 17:16:53 <gema> no, I think they run their automated tests in other place

 17:16:58 <gema> cool

 17:17:03 <roignac> By the way

 17:17:17 <alourie> o/

 17:17:17 <roignac> I'd like someone to try review feature in CC

 17:17:30 <gema> roignac: which feature?

 17:17:44 <gema> alourie, you can speak freely

 17:17:48 <alourie> ok

 17:17:59 <roignac> Case Conductor allows us to review testcases - though I haven't figured how for now

 17:18:17 <roignac> So we could review new testcases there, how about that?

 17:18:18 <gema> roignac: I don't think it does, we asked for them to add the under review state

 17:18:27 <alourie> From what I've seen , CC also offers flow of testing.

 17:18:41 <gema> roignac: that is a test environment, we shouldn't be using it to store data

 17:18:48 <gema> it can be teared apart any moment

 17:18:49 <alourie> we use ISO tracker for that (well, in context of testing ISO images, at least)

 17:19:03 <alourie> so what is our purpose with CC? Is it only for storing test cases?

 17:19:17 <gema> alourie: storing test cases and results, I would say

 17:19:28 <gema> if it shows them in a meaningful way

 17:19:28 <roignac> alourie, it has some reports too

 17:19:31 <alourie> so, I would use it for reporting as well?

 17:19:38 <gema> I think so

 17:19:38 <alourie> instead of ISO tracker?

 17:19:42 <gema> eventually

 17:19:46 <alourie> Ah...

 17:19:48 <gema> but that's not going to happen any time soon

 17:19:55 <gema> it's going to take us a while to get there

 17:19:59 <alourie> hm, ok

 17:20:06 <gema> and if it is not better than the iso tracker, then we won't use it for that

 17:20:14 <alourie> got ya

 17:20:27 <alourie> so it could only be used for storing test cases

 17:20:33 <gema> to start with, yes

 17:20:48 <alourie> and if it does good job with it, we can only use it for storing :-)

 17:20:51 <gema> and for community testing to report results

 17:20:55 <gema> and defects

 17:21:04 <gema> we just need to find a way to connect it to the tracker database

 17:21:05 <alourie> gema: but that's what ISO tracker is for!

 17:21:10 <alourie> hm

 17:21:10 <gema> which doesn't seem very difficult

 17:21:18 <balloons> hello everyone -- late, but thought I would lurk

 17:21:24 <gema> balloons: welcome!

 17:21:47 <alourie> gema: ok, I'm not clear on this, but let's just waut

 17:21:54 <gema> alourie: there are two functionalities on the tracker, one is to report results, the other one is to display them

 17:22:06 <gema> alourie: on a first step we are trying to replace the wiki

 17:22:14 <alourie> sure

 17:22:15 <gema> which is horrible to store test cases

 17:22:24 <alourie> +1

 17:22:28 <gema> after that, we'll see if we use the tracker fully, or just partially

 17:22:35 <gema> depending on how CC integrates with our workflow

 17:22:43 <gema> but this is not going to happen overnight in any case

 17:22:50 <alourie> I think that test content should show on the flow, either tracker or CC

 17:23:01 <alourie> we'll see how CC progresses, and make our minds later.

 17:23:06 <gema> and we don't want to screw up any release so we will do a gradual move to CC

 17:23:15 <gema> alourie: agreed

 17:23:33 <alourie> hey, if they can handle 'test case management', this is already an improvement

 17:23:38 <gema> yes

 17:23:41 <alourie> even without flows

 17:23:48 <gema> it'll flow, just give it time

 17:23:55 <alourie> sure it will :-)

 17:24:03 <gema> and this will probably free some of our good devs to do some more interesting stuff

 17:24:22 <gema> ok, the other thing I wanted to say on this topic

 17:24:24 <alourie> roignac: if you find that review option, ping me and we'll schedule something

 17:24:36 <gema> I have been thinking about how to classify the test cases and how to structure the testing, I am not sure whether we should be testing images or whether our

 17:24:45 <gema> test cases should start targetting packages themselves.

 17:24:59 <alourie> o/

 17:25:04 <gema> alourie: go ahead

 17:25:15 <alourie> I think these are different kinds of testing

 17:25:25 <alourie> you test images for being a complete product

 17:25:42 <gema> that's the thing, alourie they are not

 17:25:43 <alourie> but you test packages for verifying that they work

 17:25:47 <alourie> gema: why not?

 17:26:11 <gema> alourie: because two different people choose two different options at install time and end up with two different set of packages installed

 17:26:25 <gema> so there is no one product in an image

 17:26:33 <gema> there is virtually infite products in it

 17:26:45 <alourie> hm

 17:27:25 <alourie> so what would be purpose of ISO testing?

 17:27:25 <gema> so I guess the question is whether we are testing the end product or an artificial construct we call default image

 17:27:45 <gema> testing as many flavors of the ISO as we can

 17:27:51 <gema> taking them into account

 17:27:55 <alourie> gema: would it be too inaccurate to assume that most people install the default image?

 17:27:56 <gema> unlike now

 17:28:05 <gema> alourie: I believe so

 17:28:14 <alourie> so testing the default flow makes sense

 17:28:30 <gema> yes, and testing others makes equal sense

 17:28:51 <ScottK> The question I'd ask is "what are you testing".

 17:29:04 <ScottK> Generally for ISO testing you're testing the image and the installer.

 17:29:15 <ScottK> You aren't really testing all the applications.

 17:29:23 <alourie> so, we are actually questioning ourselves with "what purpose does ISO testing have?"

 17:29:25 <ScottK> That can allow you to narrow your test focus.

 17:29:37 <alourie> I'd agree with ScottK on this

 17:30:08 <ScottK> People who are running the development release need to test does the stuff work after it's installed and running.

 17:30:38 <phillw> indeed, getting it installed and running is an important part

 17:31:14 <gema> agreed, so what would you propose we do, ScottK ?

 17:32:03 <ScottK> I think the test cases we've had are appropriately focused on what ISO testing needs to accomplish.

 17:32:21 <ScottK> That doesn't mean they can't be improved, but they are at least in the ballpark.

 17:32:43 <ScottK> What I've seen though is that as the installer evolves, the test cases don't keep up.

 17:33:03 <gema> that's the thing, I don't think they are appropriate

 17:33:22 <gema> because they are mainly installer tests, not ISO tests

 17:33:30 <balloons> ScottK: sounds like the classic issue of adding a feature (code-wise), but not docs or tests, etc

 17:33:36 <gema> they don't tend to verify much of what's actually installed works

 17:34:12 <alourie> gema: so do we touch here definition of "ISO" as the complete system?

 17:34:34 <alourie> so, by "ISO testing" we imply testing that EVERYTHING works...

 17:34:42 <gema> I would have thought so

 17:34:44 <alourie> or, rather, "tested"

 17:34:48 <alourie> hm

 17:34:55 <ScottK> Then you better set aside a month or two for testing in the release cycle.

 17:35:08 <alourie> that "EVERYTHING" bit worries me a little

 17:35:13 <gema> ScottK: or get more people collaborating and get as much as you can automated

 17:35:23 <phillw> yikes, test every default app that the standard iso holds?

 17:35:25 <ScottK> We're an integrator and have to, to some extent, rely on upstreams to deliver working code.

 17:35:30 <gema> phillw: yes

 17:35:39 <alourie> wow

 17:35:42 <phillw> this would take some time!

 17:35:47 <gema> ScottK: we are an integrator and have to verify things integrate properly

 17:35:48 <alourie> I could see a problem here :-)

 17:36:18 <ScottK> gema: True, but not all of that verification needs to be done in the context of ISO testing.

 17:36:18 <gema> well, this is a bigger problem than this meeting, just wanted to let you know I have started to think about it

 17:36:20 <alourie> is it even viable?

 17:36:26 <gema> ScottK: agreed

 17:36:42 <gema> ScottK: but it needs to be done by ISO release time

 17:36:50 <gema> alourie: it is

 17:36:53 <alourie> gema: so here's an idea

 17:36:55 <ScottK> It needs to be done.

 17:37:00 <gema> ok

 17:37:02 <alourie> what if we split this into 2:

 17:37:13 <alourie> 1. ISO testing part 1, which includes installer and image

 17:37:26 <alourie> 2. ISO testing part 2, which includes testing that apps work

 17:37:27 <alourie> ..

 17:37:46 <alourie> in general, they could be done in parallel/separately

 17:37:55 <gema> alourie: the apps part we need to automate, I don't think running it manually unless it is necessary due to the nature of the test case works

 17:38:21 <gema> alourie: I don't see how you can test that the apps work without the installer working properly

 17:38:31 <gema> cos you don't have the system under test installed in that case

 17:38:39 <gema> anyway, we can keep discussing this on the list

 17:38:48 <alourie> ok, let's take it offline

 17:38:56 <gema> it was just a thought that occurred to me whilst trying to figure out how to populate CC

 17:39:03 <alourie> gema: ok

 17:39:12 <alourie> gema: I can also tell you about my secret idea then

 17:39:16 <alourie> :-)

 17:39:19 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-backlog

 17:39:22 <gema> alourie: cool :D

 17:39:30 <gema> any backlog info to share today?

 17:39:54 <alourie> are community tasks separate item nowdays?

 17:40:08 <gema> they are in case something got lost

 17:40:12 <gema> but we can discuss here too

 17:40:12 <alourie> ok

 17:40:21 <alourie> so I can go with wiki updates

 17:40:23 <gema> I haven't added the tasks to the blueprints yet because I didn't find the time

 17:40:27 <gema> but you can go ahead, yes

 17:40:49 <alourie> ok, so I didn't have much time to work on wiki this week, but I did make some progress

 17:41:10 <alourie> I will also make a hierarchy of the thing I want to update, and work on them too

 17:41:22 <alourie> so, I hope that I'll have something to update with soon

 17:41:30 <alourie> and then I'll send it to the list for review

 17:41:31 <alourie> ..

 17:41:57 <gema> alourie: excellent, thanks a lot

 17:42:11 <gema> anything else anyone

 17:42:12 <gema> ?

 17:42:25 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-qa-regression-testing

 17:42:28 <gema> nuclearbob: ?

 17:42:44 <nuclearbob> I've got autotest packaged now, autotest-server and autotest-client are in my ppa

 17:43:00 <gema> could you post the launchpad link to it?

 17:43:01 <nuclearbob> I've been using those to run tests on the most recent images available in our openstack cluster

 17:43:03 <nuclearbob> yeah

 17:43:20 <nuclearbob> https://launchpad.net/~nuclearbob/+archive/ppa

 17:43:22 <gema> thanks

 17:43:55 <gema> ok, thanks a lot nuclearbob

 17:44:10 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-automated-test-submissions

 17:44:12 <nuclearbob> some of the tests are failing on the precise dailies, so I'm doing more investigation to determine whether the failures are actual problems or whether the test code needs to be updated

 17:44:15 <nuclearbob> looks like some of both

 17:44:16 <gema> ups, sorry

 17:44:18 <nuclearbob> that's all from me

 17:44:35 <gema> ok, sounds good, thanks

 17:44:45 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-automated-test-submissions

 17:45:04 <gema> no progress on this task this week, so nothing to report

 17:45:12 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-metrics

 17:45:17 <gema> no progress on this one either

 17:45:26 <gema> #subtopic https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-qa-standard-sru-testing

 17:45:37 <gema> we don't have jibel around, so no progress on this one either

 17:45:45 <gema> #subtopic Community Tasks - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/TasksPrecise

 17:45:53 <gema> have we missed any community task ?

 17:46:06 <gema> that we have people here to discuss, I mean

 17:46:10 <alourie> I don't think so

 17:46:14 <gema> ok, so moving on

 17:46:28 <gema> #topic Update Lubuntu

 17:46:33 <gema> phillw: ?

 17:46:47 <phillw> all is peaceful, no horrible show-stopping bugs reported.

 17:47:01 <gema> good

 17:47:18 <gema> anything else, phillw ?

 17:47:41 <phillw> at the meeting tonight they are looking to form some teams... I'm hoping for a QA / testing team :)

 17:47:57 <gema> that'd be good, yes :D

 17:48:08 <alourie> phillw, gema: would you elaborate a bit?

 17:48:21 <alourie> a, the Lubuntu ;-)

 17:48:44 <gema> I guess phillw is getting himself a QA Team for Lubuntu, yes

 17:49:00 <alourie> gema, phillw: this reminds me

 17:49:05 <phillw> alourie: currently everything lubuntu is on one mailing list, we are looking to start to split groups so, for example, normal users do not get the chatter from the devs about what they're working on

 17:49:23 <alourie> phillw: sure,

 17:49:46 <alourie> currently, when we list different QA subgroups on wiki, we list Kubuntu QA

 17:50:10 <alourie> so, I think we need to list all the QA that we have in -buntu universe there

 17:50:17 <phillw> alourie: that would be correct, as I'm the only person on the Lubuntu QA team (and I get lonely :P )

 17:50:23 <alourie> :-)

 17:50:49 <gema> good, alourie will you take care of that?

 17:50:52 <gema> we are running out of time

 17:50:54 <alourie> gema: of course

 17:51:10 <gema> cool, thanks

 17:51:14 <gema> #topic Update Xubuntu

 17:51:24 <gema> charlie doesn't seem to be around

 17:51:28 <gema> so we are moving on

 17:51:47 <gema> #topic Update Ubuntu

 17:52:01 <gema> I don't think we have any updates for Ubuntu either, besides what we've already discussed

 17:52:10 <gema> #topic Other Topics

 17:52:23 <gema> I'd like to mention that we are not having our weekly meeting next week

 17:52:28 <gema> due to holidays and festivities

 17:52:34 <gema> are we all happy with that?

 17:52:41 <gema> or do you guys want to have it?

 17:52:41 <alourie> sure

 17:52:47 <phillw> okay with me.

 17:52:53 <alourie> ok here

 17:53:05 <gema> ok, so our next meeting will be the 4th of January

 17:53:32 <gema> if anyone wants to chair it, let me know, otherwise I will do it :)

 17:53:47 <gema> any other topic ?

 17:53:50 <alourie> gema: what was that bit about "participating in jenkins" stuff, that you wanted to mention later?

 17:54:04 <gema> ahh, we'll start with the training that hggdh is going to give

 17:54:14 <gema> and then we could have ubuntu-qa triaging issues

 17:54:28 <gema> or at least, trying to learn how to do it

 17:54:31 <alourie> triaging issues?

 17:54:44 <gema> as in, when a test fails, determine why and raise a defect if required

 17:54:52 <alourie> aha

 17:54:53 <gema> or try to reproduce on your environment to make sure it happens

 17:54:56 <alourie> ok

 17:54:56 <gema> that sort of thing

 17:55:05 <alourie> sure

 17:55:05 <gema> but we need some training for that

 17:55:16 <alourie> nod

 17:55:23 * alourie loves this stuff

 17:55:27 <balloons> does the bugsquad have anything for it now?

 17:55:42 <gema> no, bugsquad are doing different things

 17:55:47 <gema> afaik

 17:56:19 <gema> we are doing it within canonical QA

 17:56:31 <gema> but there is no reason why the community contributors cannot do it if they like to

 17:56:38 <balloons> right right..

 17:56:56 <gema> so that'd be it, any further qustions, please send to the list! :D

 17:56:59 <alourie> balloons: we split qa and bugsquad to 2 teams

 17:57:08 <gema> #endmeeting
