 15:08:30 <barry> much work done on ppa:pythoneers/lts to provide python 2.7 (and other lp dependencies) in a ppa.  this is up and running with hand-off to the launchpad folks (emailed launchpad-dev).  bug 847514.  debian bug 622279 (py27 blockers).  extensive c api subvertpy code review (was a blocker).  python bug 13021 (reference leak).  gtimelog hacking (merge pitti branch, keypress eating diagnostics, etc.).  developer experience cop.  todo: finish

 15:08:30 <barry> up gtimelog 0.7, release and upload.  continue with oneiric ftbfs and debian py27 blockers.  done.

 15:09:21 <mvo> apt: debug/fix broken private-ppa adding on 401 on https, debug/fix broken Translations-$lang fetching fallback, cherry pick fixes from the debian-sid branch

 15:09:24 <mvo> command-not-found: review/merge https://code.launchpad.net/~zkrynicki/command-not-found/fix-839609/+merge/75440

 15:09:27 <mvo> beta2: upgrade testing, ran head-first into cups hang #854490 and add some debug info

 15:10:13 <mvo> EOF

 15:10:17 <slangasek> mvo: did you see the recent report that trying to install a foreign-arch deb via s-c doesn't work?

 15:10:25 <slangasek> bug #854839

 15:10:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854839 in software-center (Ubuntu) "Skype i386 fails to install on Oneiric 64bit" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854839

 15:10:37 <mvo> slangasek: meh, let me look

 15:11:15 <mvo> slangasek: aha, I think this is actually a bug in python-apts debfile handling

 15:11:23 <mvo> that should be trivial (famous last words ;)

 15:11:48 <mvo> its a downloaded deb

 15:11:53 <slangasek> yep

 15:12:29 <slangasek> are upgrade tests working better now with the cups change?

 15:12:52 <mvo> yes, one success around lunchtime so far

 15:13:05 <mvo> then I got sidetracked by unity and the need to share some review data with them

 15:13:13 <slangasek> great (the success, not the sidetracking) :)

 15:13:49 <mvo> but I will run the next one now

 15:14:07 <slangasek> cool

 15:14:10 <slangasek> my go

 15:14:15 <mvo> honestly I think this task should be taken over by QA officially, jibel is doing a better job then me anyway

 15:14:42 <slangasek> sure, it does fit better in QA... are the two of you duplicating effort right now?

 15:15:11 <mvo> I would not call it duplication, but we do both test upgrades

 15:15:22 * slangasek nods

 15:15:23 <mvo> probably using slightly different scenarios etc

 15:18:39 <slangasek> enabled flicker-free boot for lightdm (bug #849954); if you're still seeing boot-time flickering, please file bugs; found a race condition in shutdown when more than one dm is installed (like lightdm + gdm) that causes the spinning-dots-on-text issue, fixes staged for post-beta, but I also just saw the bug again here with the fixed packages so there's another race I haven't found; traipsing through plymouth code to try to find the bug

 15:18:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 849954 in plymouth (Ubuntu Oneiric) "FFe: enable flicker-free boot with lightdm" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/849954

 15:18:45 <slangasek> ... loop that's still causing people to see segfaults, can't spot the bug and can't reproduce it, so if anybody else can and wants to be remote hands, let me know

 15:18:59 <mvo> flicker free++

 15:19:36 <stgraber> slangasek: I still saw flickering at boot time when plymouth started but I'm on dual-head so it's very likely the problem

 15:20:10 <barry> slangasek: boot-time flickering != login-time flickering, right?

 15:20:26 <slangasek> updates done for ca-certificates to fix a regression in openssl's ability to verify certificates (bug #854927), then spent yesterday scrambling to fix ca-certificates-java when this provoked deletion of libnss3 on the systems of users having -java installed (bug #855171, bug #855246)

 15:20:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854927 in openssl (Ubuntu Oneiric) "c_rehash creating bogus links to ca-certificates.crt" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854927

 15:20:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 855171 in ca-certificates-java (Ubuntu) "libnss3.so went missing after upgrade" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/855171

 15:20:30 <stgraber> slangasek: grub only starts on my laptop, then plymouth starts on both displays, the transition between the two causes a black screen on my laptop's monitor

 15:20:31 <slangasek> done

 15:20:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 855246 in ca-certificates-java (Ubuntu Oneiric) "ca-certificates 20110502+nmu1ubuntu3 (and ca-certificates-java 20110912ubuntu2): Exception in thread "main" java.security.ProviderException: Could not initialize NSS" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/855246

 15:21:09 <slangasek> stgraber: right, single->dual head might always give a flicker... but can you test with the external monitor disconnected?

 15:21:27 <stgraber> slangasek: yep, will test that

 15:21:35 <slangasek> fwiw, *I'm* still getting a flicker there... dunno what it is

 15:22:55 <stgraber> ev: last line was "- Taught Wubi and lupin..."

 15:23:21 <ev> - Fixed bug 848000 (Don't show the battery warning on desktops).

 15:23:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 848000 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Shouldn't show "should be plugged in" when on a desktop" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/848000

 15:23:22 <ev> (done)

 15:24:13 * slangasek plugs a battery in to his desktop

 15:24:35 <stgraber> - IPv6 testing

 15:24:36 <stgraber> - Switched from generating kvm instances to using LXC (so we can test on ARM)

 15:24:39 <stgraber> - Managed to get debian-installer running in a container

 15:24:41 <stgraber> - Implemented a basic test suite for netcfg

 15:24:44 <stgraber> - Now trying to figure out why one of the tests doesn't pass and will then have that code running daily

 15:24:47 <stgraber> - Next up is NM automated testing which should be a lot easier than netcfg

 15:24:52 <stgraber> - Worked around bug 838809 by restoring pre-oneiric behaviour of not starting open-iscsi when root is on iscsi and filed bug 850960 for the actual problem

 15:24:56 <stgraber> - Uploaded new friendly-recovery fixing quite a bunch of bugs

 15:24:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 838809 in open-iscsi (Ubuntu Oneiric) "authenticated and unauthenicated iscsi clients fails to complete boot" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/838809

 15:24:59 <stgraber> - Quite a few more pre-beta freeze uploads (last minute seed change for Edubuntu and some bugfixes/translations update)

 15:25:02 <stgraber> - Starting poking at the ISO tracker code, trying to port it to Drupal 7 and get LP authentication working (while waiting for IPv6 test results)

 15:25:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 850960 in open-iscsi (Ubuntu) "iscsid tries to reconnect existing session at startup, failing to do so and hanging the system" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/850960

 15:25:05 <stgraber> - TODO

 15:25:07 <stgraber> - Edubuntu ISO testing (haven't had a beta2 candidate yet, hopefully won't need much fixing)

 15:25:14 <stgraber> - Finish the automated IPv6 testing and push the code somewhere

 15:25:16 <stgraber> - Get WebLive up and running for Oneiric (both full sessions from edubuntu.org and single app export in software-center)

 15:25:20 <stgraber> - Still need to spend more time trying to get TPM working in a PPA

 15:25:22 <stgraber> (done)

 15:27:08 <slangasek> so no ISO tracker migration to django this cycle? :)

 15:27:34 <stgraber> I think everyone agrees that we shouldn't mess too much with the tracker for an LTS :)

 15:28:10 <slangasek> cjohnston:

 15:28:13 <slangasek> oops

 15:28:27 <stgraber> but if someone wants to rewrite it, we have quite a few nice specs that we worked on at the past 6 or so UDSes :)

 15:28:29 <slangasek> ah, we've lost cjwatson

 15:28:32 <slangasek> doko:

 15:28:35 <ev> he just sent me a text

 15:28:38 <ev> he's having ADSL problems

 15:28:51 <slangasek> ev: doh - thanks

 15:28:59 <doko> - ~110 uploads to fix ftbfs (still didn't catch cjwatson's karma ;)

 15:28:59 <doko> - sponsored ~20 ftbfs uploads

 15:28:59 <doko> - package removals for ftbfs

 15:28:59 <doko> - arm test rebuild did finish

 15:28:59 <doko> - binutils upload to fix regression with --as-needed/-flto and --fopenmp/-flto

 15:29:06 <ev> he's not sure if he'll be back for the meeting, but he has an engineer booked for the morn'

 15:30:13 <doko> (done)

 15:31:15 <slangasek> doko: I saw skaet asking for more info about the binutils upload; did you two come to an agreement about getting this in?

 15:32:00 <doko> slangasek, I did reply, but never got an answer

 15:32:07 <slangasek> ok

 15:33:02 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:33:57 <slangasek> since Brian couldn't be here, he asked me to cover a few things with bugs

 15:34:20 <slangasek> we have another new report up tracking stale bugs that are marked "in progress":

 15:34:24 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/foundations-bugs/canonical-foundations-old-in-progress-bug-tasks.html

 15:34:49 <slangasek> defined as a bug that's been in progress more than a month

 15:34:57 <slangasek> cjwatson: hi there - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/foundations-bugs/canonical-foundations-old-in-progress-bug-tasks.html

 15:35:24 <slangasek> cjwatson: you've just missed the lightning round; do you want to report now?

 15:36:41 <slangasek> maybe not :)

 15:36:58 <slangasek> so, in-progress bugs - I'd like us to take just a couple minutes to go through these quickly and see where they are

 15:37:08 <cjwatson> hi

 15:37:17 <cjwatson> sorry, was waiting for feedback in ... #ubuntu-release ;-)

 15:37:18 <slangasek> and see if they should be unassigned or set back to 'triaged' instead

 15:37:21 <cjwatson> some more FTBFS work

 15:37:21 <cjwatson> grub2: fixed missing licence declaration that broke hwmatch (850202)

 15:37:21 <cjwatson> curl/xmlrpc-c: helped out server team with adding udebs (831496)

 15:37:21 <cjwatson> os-prober: belatedly merged Surbhi's btrfs work (764893)

 15:37:21 <cjwatson> installer: translation updates; fixed some IPv6 bugs spotted by Stéphane; fixed failure to set up multiarch correctly (853738); fixed ubiquity test failures

 15:37:25 <cjwatson> lsb: fixed amd64 symlink bug spotted by Till (638450)

 15:37:27 <cjwatson> live-build: backported ext4 support for ARM team (803547)

 15:37:30 <cjwatson> xdeb: fixing up to work properly on oneiric; fixing various bugs that have crept in; merges; made multiarch code only trigger if multiarch is configured appropriately; trying to fix dependency resolver

 15:37:34 <cjwatson> ubuntu-archive-tools: sprucing up iso.qa posting support with the aim of adding auto-posting to cdimage

 15:37:37 <cjwatson> looking at creating InRelease files to reduce archive skew problems - apparently some security concerns though

 15:37:40 <cjwatson> switched to unity-2d; rather fewer desktop slowness problems now

 15:37:42 <cjwatson> having intermittent ADSL router problems; engineer visit scheduled for tomorrow morning

 15:37:46 <cjwatson> coming down with something; please only expect minimal supply of brainpower

 15:37:50 <cjwatson> ..

 15:38:16 <slangasek> cjwatson: thanks

 15:39:03 <slangasek> bug #341876 - ev, mpt assigned this to you and marked it in progress, is that accurate?

 15:39:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 341876 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[Feature Request] Setup WiFi" [Wishlist,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/341876

 15:39:39 <ev> slangasek: it's done, fixing :)

 15:39:49 <slangasek> ok :)

 15:39:57 <cjwatson> I've set the three I know about back to Triaged

 15:40:09 <slangasek> bug #434173 - mvo?

 15:40:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 434173 in update-manager (Ubuntu Karmic) "[karmic] Regression from 9.04 in getting fully translated Ubuntu installation" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/434173

 15:40:13 <cjwatson> which is regrettably probably more accurate

 15:40:22 <slangasek> probably not in progress for karmic anymore, at least...

 15:40:30 <mvo> slangasek: I need to re-read this one

 15:40:38 <cjwatson> although bug 441941 is arguably generally done and should have individual failures filed as separate bugs, but it's a swamp of a bug ...

 15:40:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 441941 in grub2 (Ubuntu Maverick) "grub fails after running Windows" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/441941

 15:41:06 <slangasek> mvo: ok, take your time :)

 15:42:02 <slangasek> and the last one then is for jhunt; will check in with him later

 15:42:24 <slangasek> other bugs on bdmurray's radar:

 15:42:27 <slangasek> bug #839584

 15:42:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 839584 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "package ubuntu-desktop 1.242 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: dependency problems with unity-2d" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/839584

 15:42:34 <mvo> slangasek: I think i need to embed a copy of the check-language-support script

 15:42:53 * mvo puts it on his todo

 15:42:59 <slangasek> mvo: well, the immediate question is, is it really "in progress" or should we mark it as something more realistic like "triaged"

 15:44:19 <mvo> bug #839584 is a bit mysterious, I suspect its a failure in the apt ordering code actually which is pretty nasty

 15:44:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 839584 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "package ubuntu-desktop 1.242 failed to install/upgrade: ErrorMessage: dependency problems with unity-2d" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/839584

 15:44:21 <slangasek> mvo: the log in bug #839584 confuses me... it seems to be trying to configure ubuntu-desktop before installing the dependencies, which isn't supposed to happen

 15:44:26 <slangasek> right

 15:44:31 <mvo> exactly

 15:44:45 <slangasek> should we triage that over to apt?

 15:44:59 <mvo> we have in debian-experimental the result of SoC work in the ordering code that adds a extra verification step to ensure this does not happen

 15:45:32 <mvo> but there is regression risk here, I would not want to merge this just now (even though the new code had a good bunch of runs through various upgrade scenarios)

 15:45:44 <slangasek> right

 15:45:59 <slangasek> let's not rip out the package manager's guts post-beta ;)

 15:46:06 <mvo> exactly

 15:46:17 <mvo> I reassign to apt

 15:46:30 <slangasek> thanks

 15:46:32 <mvo> I will also try to reprodue with apt-clone

 15:46:51 <slangasek> next, bug #852128

 15:46:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 852128 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Poor performance while "Calculating changes"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/852128

 15:47:00 <slangasek> mvo gets all the fun bugs

 15:47:15 <mvo> meh

 15:47:27 <slangasek> this one looks like it might be pretty easy to fix for oneiric, though...

 15:47:37 <slangasek> anyone *other* than mvo interested in having a look at it?

 15:48:02 <mvo> that is (again) a apt issue I think

 15:49:35 <slangasek> but an apt bug that doesn't require fiddling with resolver code.  Not the highest priority bug either, but if someone wants to take a swing at it, feel free

 15:49:37 <mvo> hm, or maybe not, I have look,

 15:50:02 <slangasek> last one: bug #839662

 15:50:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 839662 in man-db (Ubuntu) "package man-db 2.6.0.2-2 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/839662

 15:50:14 <mvo> a non-apt bug, wooooh

 15:50:21 <slangasek> yes, merely a debconf bug :)

 15:50:39 <slangasek> cjwatson: is this error familiar?

 15:50:40 <slangasek> debconf: DbDriver "config": rename failed: Is a directory

 15:50:45 <cjwatson> huh, that's a new one on me

 15:52:03 <cjwatson> I suspect fs corruption, but have posted asking for more details

 15:52:16 <slangasek> ok

 15:52:19 <slangasek> thanks

 15:52:26 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:53:14 <slangasek> is anyone here seeing crash reports from plymouthd?

 15:53:36 <slangasek> we get plenty of duplicate reports, but I have no idea what the common element is :/

 15:54:47 <slangasek> ev, cjwatson: rickspencer3 was saying yesterday that he was having trouble installing from USB with the daily; was this a known issue (to you)?

 15:54:56 <ev> nope

 15:55:02 <ev> bug reports welcome

 15:55:06 * slangasek nods

 15:55:09 <slangasek> I'll circle around

 15:55:13 <ev> thanks
