 16:03:08 <cjwatson> doko ev cjwatson jhunt barry stgraber

 16:04:47 <doko> - binutils 2.22 release

 16:04:47 <doko> - GCC updates

 16:04:47 <doko> - eglibc 2.15: new merge from the trunk, tracked down bug #893605, no solution y

 16:04:47 <doko> et

 16:04:47 <doko> - merged and tested the glibc sf/hf linker patch, ldd not yet working

 16:04:47 <doko> - re-enabled previously disabled ruby1.9.1 packages for main

 16:04:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 893605 in eglibc (Ubuntu) "crashes with glibc-2.14/2.15 on dlopen (seen with kvm and gnucash)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/893605

 16:04:49 <doko> - some merges

 16:04:55 <doko> (done)

 16:05:16 <ev> Assigned to the DX team for this week; building a Jenkins infrastructure around Autopilot and creating tools for safely constructing Autopilot tests without hosing the developer's local configuration.

 16:05:16 <ev> Back on the crash database come this weekend

 16:05:16 <ev> (done)

 16:05:59 <cjwatson> Mostly finished Perl 5.14 transition.  Worked on a few others (ocaml, imagemagick, icu), cleaned up build failures, etc.

 16:06:02 <cjwatson> Finished drafting my specs.

 16:06:05 <cjwatson> Looked into the situation with .la files.  I think it would be worth making a bit more of an effort to kill off the ones in Ubuntu which are harmful, but haven't published a report yet.

 16:06:09 <cjwatson> Experimented with doing a multiarch i386->amd64 crossgrade.  I've uploaded several of the necessary patches and the rest are awaiting upload by others; after that I'll have another go ...

 16:06:13 <cjwatson> Fixed debootstrap confusion when it tries to install a package with two versions in the Packages file.

 16:06:16 <cjwatson> Fixed a couple of QA-reported bugs in daily builds: bug 893014, bug 893060, bug 892903.

 16:06:19 <cjwatson> Discussed server installer plans with Daviey.

 16:06:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 893014 in user-setup (Ubuntu Precise) "'user-setup-udeb' failed with error code 1 on alternate when 'Encrypt your home directory' is selected" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/893014

 16:06:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 893060 in casper (Ubuntu Precise) "on live session ubiquity launcher asks for password" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/893060

 16:06:21 <cjwatson> Some archive infrastructure work: moved a few jobs from ftpmaster to people, arranged for them to attempt to run earlier in the hour and retry later if need be, and filed an RT to allow the next similar chunk of work.

 16:06:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 892903 in partman-crypto (Ubuntu) "encrypted LVM install fails with "unsafe swap space detected"" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/892903

 16:06:25 <cjwatson> (done)

 16:06:41 <jhunt_> Similar to last week: More blueprint work. Raft of Upstart Cookbook

 16:06:41 <jhunt_> updates (not yet published). Lots of work on Upstart Job Logging -

 16:06:41 <jhunt_> resolved the failing test issue and reworked the tests for the new

 16:06:41 <jhunt_> architecture. Currently finishing the required changes to the inotify

 16:06:41 <jhunt_> handling in the test code.

 16:06:44 <jhunt_> ùÖ§

 16:07:12 <barry> much work on dbus-python for python 3.  branch compiles for both 2.7 and 3.2.  still working on one pesky test failure under python 3, but at least it doesn't crash any more.  will be blogging about it today, and following up on the python-porting mailing list.  also did: consulted for a while w/launchpad guys about a mysterious mailman outage; updated claws plugins; finished up blueprints.  out tomorrow and friday for usa holiday.

 16:07:13 <barry> done.

 16:07:34 <stgraber> - Testing tracker

 16:07:34 <stgraber> - http://91.189.93.73 is usually up to date with what's in the branch

 16:07:34 <stgraber> - Got most of the UI working, you can now file testing results on it!

 16:07:34 <stgraber> - Spent most of Monday working on migration scripts and SSO integration to match the 30k users in the current DB with their LP accounts

 16:07:37 <stgraber> - Getting ready to use the test instance for alpha-1 testing

 16:07:39 <stgraber> - More UI improvements

 16:07:42 <stgraber> - Working build notifications

 16:07:44 <stgraber> - Working subscriptions/unsubscriptions, still need to work on UI a bit

 16:07:47 <stgraber> - Worked on bug 823366, still need to wait for some feedback from Tom Ellis and try to reproduce slangasek's issue in VM, then upload and SRU time!

 16:07:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 823366 in ifenslave-2.6 (Ubuntu) "bond_primary is ignored in /etc/network/interfaces" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/823366

 16:07:50 <stgraber> - TODO

 16:07:52 <stgraber> - Get the ISO tracker ready for alpha-1

 16:07:55 <stgraber> - Setup ISO tracker for Daily testing and get the CD build machine to push the new builds automatically

 16:07:58 <stgraber> - Look at the new ifupdown in Debian (beta2), isolate the fix for bug 876829 and SRU to Oneiric

 16:07:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 876829 in ifupdown (Ubuntu Precise) "Oneiric's ifupdown breaks ip aliases" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/876829

 16:08:01 <stgraber> - Still need to get my iSCSI test setup online again and then look at the merge...

 16:08:04 <stgraber> (done)

 16:08:07 <stgraber> (hopefully I'll be able to work a bit on my non-ISO tracker work items next week :))

 16:08:27 <stgraber> oh, and if you have a few minutes to spare, please try and break the ISO tracker at http://91.189.93.73

 16:08:41 <stgraber> I'm looking at the logs and fixing anything that breaks :)

 16:08:44 <cjwatson> since Brian's on holiday, I'll skip the bugs topic; if you have anything you're concerned about, that can be AOB :)

 16:08:49 <cjwatson> [TOPIC] Blueprints

 16:09:09 <cjwatson> Does anyone have blueprints they *haven't* finished drafting yet, or that haven't been approved?

 16:09:25 * doko needs to finish two

 16:09:30 <cjwatson> (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~/+specs?role=drafter may help)

 16:10:26 <cjwatson> The deadline is this Friday, so please send me an IRC message or e-mail when you're done with those and I guess I'll substitute for Steve as approver

 16:11:36 <cjwatson> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:12:12 <cjwatson> the multiarch crossgrade stuff I was playing with has the makings of being really cool :)

 16:12:27 <cjwatson> (I'm not doing anything clever myself, just filling in metadata really)

 16:12:48 <barry> cjwatson: can you describe more what it would allow us to do?

 16:12:48 <doko> like Multi-Arch: foreign attributes?

 16:12:56 <ev> cjwatson: the crash database hasn't been approved: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-p-crash-database

 16:12:57 <cjwatson> barry: upgrade from i386 to amd64 in-place

 16:13:02 <stgraber> oh, that reminds me I need to push quite a few more Multi-Arch:foreign changes to make upstart:i386 install on amd64 :)

 16:13:06 <cjwatson> doko: yeah, and a few more serious multiarchings

 16:13:09 <cjwatson> (like libapt)

 16:13:09 <barry> nice

 16:13:18 <cjwatson> ev: ack, thanks

 16:13:21 <ev> cheers

 16:13:46 <cjwatson> ev: if you're ready for it to be looked at, please mark it Review or Pending Approval

 16:14:04 <ev> oops! Thought I had done. That must be why Steve skipped it

 16:14:12 <ev> done

 16:14:14 <cjwatson> could be

 16:15:03 <cjwatson> barry: well, when I say in-place, it requires one reboot in the middle; hard to automate completely

 16:15:20 <cjwatson> (you need a 64-bit kernel in order to execute any 64-bit binaries)

 16:15:23 <barry> oh, that's so windows

 16:15:36 <cjwatson> heh

 16:15:44 <stgraber> cjwatson: I'm sure you can get rid of that extra reboot by installing qemu-user-static

 16:15:54 <cjwatson> I thought of that as I was typing it

 16:15:59 <stgraber> but that's going to make things a lot slower :)

 16:16:54 <stgraber> then you can try a crossgrade from i386 to armel on a x86_64 machine :)

 16:17:46 <stgraber> (would need some tweaks to load the binfmt stuff very very early though)

 16:18:13 <cjwatson> and you'd need to force binfmt-support to stay native-arch - doesn't sound so fun

 16:18:22 <cjwatson> you could crossgrade a chroot though

 16:19:01 <barry> that would actually be pretty interesting

 16:20:13 <cjwatson> anything else, or shall we finish early?

 16:20:24 <stgraber> nothing here

 16:20:29 <barry> i'm good

 16:20:34 <cjwatson> happy thanksgiving, those who celebrate it :)

 16:20:39 <barry> thanks! :)

 16:20:59 <doko> one of the faster meetings ...

 16:20:59 <stgraber> that was months ago ;)
