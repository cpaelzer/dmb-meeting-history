 17:01:42 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 17:02:02 <jdstrand> Ubuntu 11.10 is scheduled to release in next week. If you are interested, it would be great if people helped make sure that the [[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker|Ubuntu CVE Tracker]] is up to date for the devel release (particularly for universe/multiverse packages).

 17:02:13 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 17:02:17 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 17:02:41 <jdstrand> this may be a potentially short week for me-- I am attempting to swap this friday for monday

 17:02:50 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 17:03:10 <jdstrand> I have at least one more MIR security review I need to do (almost done!)

 17:03:50 <jdstrand> hope to get to my few remaining work items (they aren't tied to the release)

 17:04:02 <jdstrand> also doing UDS preparation

 17:04:14 <jdstrand> and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/ReleaseCycle duties

 17:04:43 <jdstrand> I figured I can take the qrt testing, we'll coordinate outside of this meeting via the wiki like normal

 17:04:49 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 17:05:00 <sbeattie> jdstrand: FYI, I set up the QRT testing wiki page already

 17:05:11 <mdeslaur> I have a couple of updates ready to go, and will work on testing them this week

 17:05:26 <mdeslaur> monday, I'm off, because it's Turkey day, or Queen day, or Queen Turkey day, or something

 17:05:26 <jdstrand> sbeattie: exceelent

 17:05:54 <mdeslaur> I will also be creating the uds blueprints this week

 17:06:26 <mdeslaur> I'm also on triage, and kernel workflow duty

 17:06:29 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 17:06:31 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're next

 17:07:35 <sbeattie> I've got a couple of updates that I'm still working on.

 17:07:44 <sbeattie> I'm also doing UDS prep

 17:07:54 <sbeattie> As well as QRT testing for oneiric.

 17:08:02 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me.

 17:08:06 <sbeattie> micahg: poke.

 17:08:51 <micahg> Chromium updates (for real this time :)), possibly QRT browser run through for oneiric, patch pilot

 17:09:05 <micahg> ..

 17:09:18 <micahg> tyhicks: you're up

 17:09:23 <jdstrand> oh, I'm patch piloting this week too

 17:09:36 <tyhicks> I am doing the community role for my first time this week

 17:09:45 <tyhicks> Outside of learning and carrying out those duties, I'll be working to fix several eCryptfs bugs

 17:10:00 <tyhicks> jdstrand: That's it for me

 17:10:15 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
