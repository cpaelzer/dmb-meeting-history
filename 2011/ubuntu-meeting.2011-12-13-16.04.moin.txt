 16:05:13 <utlemming> #TOPIC Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:05:31 <utlemming> Reviewing items from last week...

 16:05:51 <utlemming> and it doesn't look like there are any

 16:06:03 <utlemming> does anyone have any follow up on last weeks discussion items?

 16:06:31 <utlemming> okay then

 16:06:32 <utlemming> #topic Precise Development

 16:06:52 <utlemming> I believe that we are sans Daviey today

 16:07:11 <zul> improvise! improvise!

 16:07:17 <hallyn_> ok, zul - take charge

 16:07:28 <zul> not me

 16:07:35 <utlemming> zul, bug 883988?

 16:07:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 883988 in glance (Ubuntu Precise) "db migration failing when upgrading glance - trying to create existing tables" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/883988

 16:07:44 <zul> still need to be looked at

 16:07:52 <SpamapS> o/

 16:07:57 <jamespage> o/

 16:08:37 <utlemming> bug 893926

 16:08:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 893926 in eucalyptus (Ubuntu) "Contains traces of UEC" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/893926

 16:08:49 <utlemming> still doesn't have an owner....any takers?

 16:09:35 <utlemming> no?

 16:09:43 <SpamapS> lol .. draw straws

 16:09:58 <utlemming> and SpamapS drew the shortest one!

 16:10:00 <utlemming> fancy that

 16:10:17 <SpamapS> I think we probably should try to sync with Debian at this point

 16:10:51 <utlemming> lets leave this for an action then

 16:11:02 <utlemming> bug 855030

 16:11:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 855030 in nova (Ubuntu Oneiric) "Encountering sporadic AMQPChannelException" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/855030

 16:11:57 <utlemming> zul, it looks like its fixed released?

 16:12:09 <zul> utlemming: yeah

 16:12:16 <zul> the fix landed in percise

 16:12:23 <smoser> percise, yo

 16:12:31 <utlemming> hallyn: how is bug 881903 moving along?

 16:12:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 881903 in lxc (Ubuntu) "lxc-fedora template is broken" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/881903

 16:12:46 <hallyn_> bot?

 16:12:51 <hallyn_> utlemming: it's not

 16:13:01 <hallyn_> we're waiting on lxc upstream release

 16:13:10 <utlemming> k

 16:13:25 <hallyn_> and that is lower prio than the container reboot stuff, which is holding him up

 16:13:29 <hallyn_> so i don't care to push :)

 16:13:37 <utlemming> fair enough

 16:13:58 <utlemming> (if anyone can't tell, I'm working down last weeks meeting notes)

 16:14:09 <hallyn_> good idea :)

 16:14:12 <utlemming> jamespage: how is bug 888124 looking?

 16:14:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 888124 in excalibur-logkit (Ubuntu) "excalibur-logkit version 2.0-8 failed to build with openjdk-7" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/888124

 16:14:43 <jamespage> oh - fixable; its part of a larger piece of work to transition default-java from 6->7

 16:15:03 <jamespage> I should prob fix it so it comes off the list

 16:15:44 <SpamapS> jamespage: is there a transition tracker for that, or does it just require rebuilds for rebuild sake?

 16:16:10 <jamespage> SpamapS, well it does not really need one per say

 16:16:20 <jamespage> as stuff thats already in the archive will continue to work

 16:16:39 <jamespage> as Java is bytecode backwards compatibile - but not source

 16:16:44 <SpamapS> right, but rebuilding so we know it will not FTBFS

 16:16:54 <jamespage> SpamapS, thats the one

 16:17:05 <jamespage> java7-ftbfs tag in lp will tell you what it broken

 16:17:54 <utlemming> it looks like we never found an adopter for bug 607039

 16:17:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 607039 in nfs-utils (Ubuntu) "NFS4 automount using replicated servers doesn't work" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/607039

 16:17:59 <utlemming> any takers this week?

 16:18:21 <smb> err

 16:18:54 <smb> Well wanted to try to supply a debdiff but got distracted

 16:19:28 <smb> I'd propose to have an alias defined in /etc/modprobe.d

 16:19:36 <smb> ..

 16:20:20 <hallyn_> smb: i like the idea of goin gthrough debian,

 16:20:36 <hallyn_> question is just whether the submitter needs a faster fix.  but i assume they can just fix it locally with a modprobe alias?

 16:20:40 <hallyn_> you've tested that?

 16:21:05 <smb> hallyn_, either that or just replace fstype nfs4 (which is deprecated anyway) by nfs

 16:21:20 <smb> hallyn_, in small scale tested both

 16:21:39 <smb> But apparently the reporters lost interest...

 16:21:55 <hallyn_> in auto.mnt.  sounds good

 16:22:01 <hallyn_> well,

 16:22:11 <hallyn_> if they lost interest, let's go through debian, i say...

 16:22:12 <hallyn_> (fwiw)

 16:22:35 <utlemming> RoAkSoAx: there was a bit of discussion last week with around bug 887186

 16:22:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 887186 in orchestra (Ubuntu) "squid proxy big and small buckets not functioning correctly" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/887186

 16:22:37 <smb> hallyn_, Agreed. Guess I need to file a bug with fix there then

 16:22:38 <hallyn_> i'd like to think they lost interest bc the s/nfs4/nfs/ fix worked for them locally :)

 16:23:00 <smb> hallyn_, My guess too :)

 16:23:04 <hallyn_> ok - i'm not 100% clear how you'd do the debdiff, do you mind doing it?

 16:23:36 <smb> hallyn_, I would not mind. Can take a bit of time though

 16:23:52 <smb> my only working day this year is Thursday. :-P

 16:24:36 <utlemming> adam_g:  bug 862558

 16:24:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 862558 in cobbler-enlist (Ubuntu Oneiric) "cobbler-enlist is not checking for return codes enough" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/862558

 16:25:26 <utlemming> no adam_g?

 16:25:47 <utlemming> back to zul then: bug 871278

 16:25:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 871278 in nova (Ubuntu Precise) "Cannot attach volumes to instances if tgt is used" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/871278

 16:26:01 <zul> utlemming: working on that now

 16:26:10 <zul> or trying to

 16:26:35 <hallyn_> ouch

 16:26:44 <SpamapS> utlemming: cobbler-enlist is undergoing quite a few revisions, so that bug may become moot in the near future.

 16:26:59 <utlemming> okay, good to know

 16:27:11 <utlemming> koolhead: how is bug 890362 moving along?

 16:27:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 890362 in nova (Ubuntu) "Should glance user's shell be /bin/false?" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/890362

 16:27:42 <smoser> i thought adam_g had a merge proposal for tath

 16:27:55 <zul> it got merged and uploaded

 16:28:25 <smoser> yeah... but the nova task is still open

 16:28:38 <smoser> apparently, "should glance user's shell be /bin/false" also affects nova

 16:28:54 <smoser> i'm assuming someone thinks' nova's shell should be /bin/false also

 16:29:27 <utlemming> utlemming: bug 891433

 16:29:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 891433 in squid3 (Ubuntu) "squid3 miss_access bug, fix not included in LTS" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/891433

 16:29:38 <utlemming> I need to put in the merge proposal, but otherwise its fixed

 16:31:29 <utlemming> RoAkSoAx: bug 898840

 16:31:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 898840 in cobbler (Ubuntu) "'default' preseed should be enlister" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/898840

 16:32:58 <utlemming> okay

 16:33:04 <utlemming> finally...I think we're through the list

 16:33:15 <utlemming> does anyone else have Precise Development topics?

 16:33:40 <utlemming> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:33:47 <utlemming> any topics here?

 16:33:57 <SpamapS> SCALE10X

 16:34:07 <SpamapS> http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/

 16:34:20 <SpamapS> Jorge Castro and I will be presenting, and there will be a Juju Charm School on Friday!

 16:34:59 <SpamapS> ALso there is a CFP for Velocity out

 16:35:38 <utlemming> Moving on then...

 16:35:41 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:35:53 <utlemming> hggdh, ?

 16:36:06 <SpamapS> Last bit, get your talks submitted: http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012

 16:36:41 <utlemming> no hggdh...so well move on then

 16:36:43 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:36:53 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:36:56 * hggdh is here

 16:37:04 <smb> The fix for the thing that required idle=halt on ec2 has been fixed upstream and in latest precise.

 16:37:17 <smb> Im currently trying to bisect bug 901305

 16:37:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901305 in linux (Ubuntu) "precise fails boot on ec2 hvm" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901305

 16:37:37 <smb> Unfortunately I ended up on something unreasonable on first run

 16:37:51 <smb> Not sure I did something wrong or what happened. So I go again

 16:37:53 <smb> ..

 16:38:45 <smoser> smb, the other thing on your list is the atop bug.

 16:39:04 <smoser> which seems fairly iportant for 11.10 even though its fix-released in precise already.

 16:39:08 <smb> smoser, right. That one seems only to happen on ec2

 16:39:18 <smoser> oh...

 16:39:24 <smb> Not in my test system

 16:39:32 <smoser> are you convinced that it is fix-released in precise ?

 16:39:36 <smoser> or was i just lucky

 16:39:46 <smb> Thats why I asked whether people know which xen version that instance got

 16:40:19 <smb> So when trying first grep for dmseg|grep Xen and note the Xen version

 16:40:25 <smoser> right.

 16:40:38 <smoser> well.. i'll launch a bunch of instances later and see what i find.

 16:40:48 <smb> smoser, Thanks a lot

 16:41:07 <utlemming> smb: anything else?

 16:41:18 <smb> not from here..

 16:41:25 <utlemming> okay, hggdh, back to you

 16:41:36 <utlemming> hggdh, do you have anything for us?

 16:41:59 <hggdh> utlemming: just some questions:

 16:42:25 <hggdh> (1) is cloud-init on Lucid expected to work with Cobbler on Oneiric? If so, we have a bug

 16:42:59 <hggdh> (2) are you all good on the QA resources?

 16:43:34 <smoser> cobbler will not work with version of cloud-init in lucid.

 16:43:59 <hggdh> smoser: ah, thank you. So we need to adjust the cobbler setup on the Lab

 16:44:13 <smoser> as cobbler uses /var/lib/cloud/nocloud/seed which i think only exists in at earliest maverick.

 16:44:28 <smoser> but the cloud-init stufff is only used for juju i think.

 16:44:30 <smoser> right?

 16:45:04 <hggdh> I think it is needed for cobbler commands, like reboot, is it not?

 16:45:43 <SpamapS> no

 16:45:46 <smoser> not that i'm aware of

 16:45:48 <smoser> but i could be wrong

 16:45:53 <SpamapS> hggdh: it is only used in first-boot config stuff

 16:46:13 <smoser> i was not aware of anything that did power control other than "real power control" (ie, lights-out or ipmi or something)

 16:46:47 <hggdh> OK. will check more carefully. Right now I know I cannot reboot via cobbler on Lucid

 16:46:53 <hggdh> thank you

 16:46:56 <hggdh> ..

 16:47:22 <SpamapS> hggdh: cobbler doesn't have the ability to "reboot" stuff AFAIK, only to turn the power off/on.

 16:48:23 <utlemming> anything else here?

 16:48:36 <hggdh> SpamapS: heh. RTFM seems to be needed for me, then. I based myself on the cobbler URL

 16:48:41 <hggdh> nope, I am done

 16:48:50 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

 16:48:58 <utlemming> NCommander, ?

 16:49:02 <NCommander> Not much to say

 16:49:16 <NCommander> Mostly waiting on hardware (not sure how much I can sya behond that)

 16:49:19 <SpamapS> armhf seems to be moving along nicely

 16:49:22 <NCommander> armhf bootstrap is proceeding nicely

 16:49:25 <NCommander> bah, ninja'ed

 16:49:30 <SpamapS> JINX

 16:49:44 <utlemming> Okay then...

 16:49:46 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

 16:49:46 <NCommander> fortunately, that only applies to speaking, not typing ;-)

 16:49:50 <NCommander> anyway, done

 16:50:13 <utlemming> Anyone have anything from or for our fine community of users?

 16:50:40 <utlemming> I will take that as a no...

 16:50:42 <utlemming> #topic Open Discussion

 16:50:52 <utlemming> Any open discussion topics?

 16:51:08 <Ursinha> Santa is coming

 16:51:28 <SpamapS> I think we should eliminate the "Community" topic. It implies that there are people here at the meeting who are not in the community.

 16:51:48 <m_3> SpamapS: +1

 16:51:50 <utlemming> +1

 16:52:11 <smoser> i'm not in the community

 16:52:18 <hallyn_> you ARE the community

 16:52:19 <smoser> ignore me.

 16:52:20 <SpamapS> We can table it until January though, since we are already missing quite a few who may have strong opinions on that.

 16:52:29 <SpamapS> But it just ocurred to me.

 16:52:29 <utlemming> #action invite smoser into the community

 16:52:29 * meetingology invite smoser into the community

 16:52:35 <SpamapS> NICE

 16:52:40 <Ursinha> lol

 16:52:45 <SpamapS> Another thing that I noticed.. meeting minutes not going out... ???

 16:52:54 <smoser> i did not send them out.

 16:52:56 <smoser> :-(

 16:52:57 <smoser> fail.

 16:53:02 <smoser> i can do that. i just didn't get to it.

 16:53:04 <smoser> they are supposed to

 16:53:06 <SpamapS> The bot like, generates them automatically.. so is there any reason they're not going out to ubuntu-devel and ubuntu-server ?

 16:53:21 <smoser> where does it generate them to ?

 16:54:25 * rbasak wonders if adam_g and RoAkSoAx are DST-induced laggards

 16:54:25 <SpamapS> smoser: meetingology help page explains it

 16:54:46 <SpamapS> rbasak: adam_g most likely yes.. RoAkSoAx is in EDT , so he has no excuse. ;)

 16:55:05 <utlemming> isn't adam_g in Oregon?

 16:55:39 <utlemming> okay, lets call this

 16:55:41 <SpamapS> yes

 16:55:42 <utlemming> #Announce next meeting date and time

 16:55:54 <smoser> fwiw, i'm not seeing in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology where minutes are kept.

 16:56:07 <rbasak> Speaking of DST, Google Calendar doesn't seem to support UTC times for meetings - but it's been pointed out to me that if you specify Reykjavik then meetings will be pegged to UTC

 16:56:10 <smoser> and if they *are* kept somewhere, then personally, i dont see a lot of reason to manually email them to some mailing lists.

 16:56:16 <robbiew> rbasak: huh?

 16:56:35 <robbiew> yes it does...you just have to have UTC as your default TZ

 16:56:45 <SpamapS> smoser: #endmeeting sends you the link, IIRC

 16:56:48 <hallyn_> smoser: I'd like to do either m-l or blog, not both

 16:57:27 <SpamapS> hallyn_: there's a script that does it automatically

 16:57:45 <hallyn_> so everyone says

 16:58:12 <SpamapS> lp:~clint-fewbar/+junk/ubuntuserver-minutes/

 16:58:31 <SpamapS> Used to be mentioned in the "how to write the minutes" page in the serverteam KB

 16:59:10 <hallyn_> SpamapS: I'll try it next week, thx

 16:59:13 <smoser> https://code.launchpad.net/~clint-fewbar/+junk/ubuntuserver-minutes/

 16:59:34 <SpamapS> utlemming: endmeeting?

 16:59:35 <utlemming> Tuesday 2011-12-20 at 1600 UTC - #ubuntu-meeting

 16:59:38 <utlemming> #endmeeting
