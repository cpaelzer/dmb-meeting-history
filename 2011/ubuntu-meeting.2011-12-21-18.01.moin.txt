 18:02:10 * bdmurray bdmurray to investigate what happened to the rhythmbox package hook

 18:02:42 <bdmurray> I filed and fixed bug 904527 regarding this

 18:02:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 904527 in rhythmbox (Ubuntu) "apport package hook no longer installed" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/904527

 18:03:01 <bdmurray> pedro_: do you think that is worth SRU'ing to oneiric?

 18:03:12 <pedro_> would be nice to have it there, yes

 18:03:27 <bdmurray> okay, I can do that

 18:03:56 <pedro_> cool ,thanks bdmurray

 18:04:09 <bdmurray> pedro_: no problem

 18:04:21 <bdmurray> that's that for previous actions

 18:04:30 <bdmurray> #topic Engineering Team Bug Status

 18:04:42 <bdmurray> pedro_: do you have anything?

 18:06:16 <pedro_> not much to share, just something that might be interesting to the triagers using bugzilla to file bugs at the upstream projects: http://paulrouget.com/e/learnbugzilla/

 18:06:51 <pedro_> ..

 18:07:18 <bdmurray> pedro_: that looks really neat - thanks!

 18:07:45 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: any news from you?

 18:07:51 <jsalisbury> One bug I'd like to mention is bug 904569  It appears to be a regression in and Oneiric kernel update.

 18:07:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 904569 in linux (Ubuntu) "Linux 3.0.0-15-generic-pae causes laptops to fail to resume from suspend (Dell XPS 1645, Sony Vaio VPCF1390)" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/904569

 18:08:38 <jsalisbury> Lot's of new bugs coming in for this.  I'm working on bisecting, but the SRU team is out until the new year.

 18:08:58 <jsalisbury> ..

 18:09:47 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: what's the resume-trace procedure mentioned in comment #3?  I haven't seen that before

 18:11:42 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, It's a procedure to try and track down suspend issues.  I personally haven't gone through it, yet.

 18:12:13 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: oh, I see now it just has a fancy name ;-)

 18:12:32 <jsalisbury> right

 18:12:41 <bdmurray> thanks for bringing that bug up

 18:12:56 <jsalisbury> np, figured it's something to keep an eye out for

 18:14:00 <bdmurray> I spent some time reading about libata error messages this week

 18:14:06 <bdmurray> https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/articles/l/i/b/Libata_error_messages.html

 18:14:43 <bdmurray> and come to find out we were receiving some more bug reports about ubiquity and package installation failures that were really hardware related

 18:15:22 <bdmurray> so I've taken care of that in the general ubuntu apport hook and also in my bug bot (which will catch these from previous releases)

 18:15:38 <bdmurray> and I cleaned up some existing bug reports

 18:16:38 <bdmurray> I also updated the ubiquity apport package hook to tag ubiquity bugs ubiquity-upgrade if people choose to reinstall Ubuntu using ubiquity

 18:17:41 <bdmurray> It also looks like the call for help with update-manager-core bug reports worked as there are now 0. ;-)

 18:18:02 <bdmurray> So thanks for helping with those.

 18:18:25 <bdmurray> #topic Bug Escalations

 18:18:51 <bdmurray> Are there any High or Critical bugs that we should be aware of or are being neglected?

 18:21:10 <bdmurray> okay then

 18:21:17 <bdmurray> #topic Other Topics

 18:21:25 <bdmurray> Is there anything else to discuss?

 18:22:37 <bdmurray> I'm on holiday next week as I think most of us are so the next meeting will be 1/4/2012.

 18:22:45 <bdmurray> Thanks everyone!
