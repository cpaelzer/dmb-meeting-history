 16:02:11 <Daviey> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:18 <Daviey> ALL: review http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html and make known any other bugs that need to be added to the list.

 16:02:30 <Daviey> So.. i didn't get much feedback from this item..

 16:03:46 <Daviey> we'll come back to this

 16:03:59 <Daviey> #topic smb, jamespage, hggdh to work on triaging bug 790712

 16:04:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Precise) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:04:09 <Daviey> Did this make any progress?

 16:04:52 <jamespage> I don't think so

 16:05:00 <jamespage> (well at least not from me)

 16:05:22 <Daviey> we'll come back to that then, later on :(

 16:05:38 <Daviey> #topic utlemming to figure out qemu image situation (carry-over)

 16:05:49 <Daviey> utlemming isn't present.

 16:06:04 <Daviey> #topic

 16:06:08 <Daviey> #topic Precise Development

 16:06:27 <Daviey> Merge and sync difference is looking good, we seem on target.

 16:06:32 <Daviey> Specific issues being tracked:

 16:06:38 <robbiew> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+specs?role=assignee

 16:06:38 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:06:40 <robbiew> :)

 16:06:59 <Daviey> Shall we come back to specs?

 16:07:20 <Daviey> bug 881464, anyone want to handle an MIR?

 16:07:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 881464 in keystone (Ubuntu) "[MIR] keystone" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/881464

 16:07:31 <utlemming> \o

 16:07:54 <smoser> did utlemming just raise his hand in response to "anyone want to handle an MIR?"

 16:07:56 <smoser> i think he did.

 16:07:57 <Daviey> utlemming: Have you handled a MIR before?

 16:08:18 <utlemming> ah....that's what I get for showing up late to a meeting

 16:08:20 <zul> Daviey: heh thats on my list for the openstack spec

 16:08:28 * Daviey assigns utlemming, if you have any questions - fire them to zul :)

 16:08:39 <hallyn> if someone is looking for MIRs we have a bunch for spice dependencies :(

 16:08:47 <smoser> you're bringing donuts next week also.

 16:08:58 <Daviey> bug 858878 , rbasak - status?

 16:09:00 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 858878 in cobbler (Ubuntu Precise) "lack of csrf protection in cobbler-web" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/858878

 16:09:00 <hallyn> and on laundry duty

 16:09:42 <rbasak> it looks like it'd be a fairly extensive patch, and I found another security issue which I need to check as well. cobbler-web doesn't seem to have been written with security in mind

 16:10:01 <zul> rbasak: well it is a django app :)

 16:10:06 <Daviey> rbasak: that might have to be our approach

 16:10:14 <Daviey> zul: that is crap, django can be secure.

 16:10:24 <zul> Daviey: joking

 16:10:27 <rbasak> it seems to be using GET requests with side effects too

 16:10:31 <Daviey> rbasak: Do you want to take the discussion to upstream?

 16:10:34 <rbasak> though I need to verify this

 16:10:44 <rbasak> Daviey: yes

 16:10:48 <Daviey> cool

 16:11:02 <hallyn> zul: <ssssh, he ran out of coffee this morning, keep a low profile>

 16:11:06 <Daviey> jamespage: bug 801494 , we were waiting to see if it was a udev issue - any news that you know of?

 16:11:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 801494 in Ubuntu Precise "Multi part LVM layout: system fails to boot due to missing volumes" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/801494

 16:11:16 <RoAkSoAx> is the latest release/checkout/branch from the cobbler repo with these security issues?

 16:11:29 <jamespage> well the general opinion is that it is

 16:11:42 <jamespage> but that said I can't actually reproduce anymore

 16:11:54 <Daviey> jamespage: do you know if the discussion is ongoing?  Are we likely to get a fix for a1?

 16:12:01 <Daviey> jamespage: Ooo

 16:12:04 <Daviey> that sounds good.

 16:12:17 <Daviey> jamespage: can you confirm that you cannot reproduce it this week?

 16:12:20 <jamespage> yes

 16:12:23 <Daviey> (difficult question, i know)

 16:12:42 <Daviey> bug 858883, nobody assigned

 16:13:07 <Daviey> rbasak: is this one that would be good to include in the discussion upstream?

 16:13:30 <rbasak> for a general security discussion, yes, although it looks like this one *is* a simple one line patch

 16:13:53 <Daviey> oh good.

 16:13:59 <Daviey> rbasak: can you take ownership of that? :)

 16:14:04 <rbasak> OK

 16:14:16 <Daviey> bug 862558, no assignee - adam_g, is this something you want?

 16:21:49 <Daviey> smoser: are you present?

 16:22:01 <smoser> i just pushed a branch

 16:22:07 <smoser> but i think lynxman is merging from debian

 16:22:23 <smoser> and i would suggest he just merge my branch in his upstream merge.

 16:22:34 <zul> smoser: merged was done this morning

 16:23:09 <lynxman> smoser: merged by zul then he got all my 2.6.1 already packagd plugins :)

 16:23:31 <smoser> oh.

 16:23:47 <Daviey> does this mean the issue is fixed?

 16:23:58 <Daviey> Or is smoser's fix needed to be re-based to current archive?

 16:24:18 <Daviey> lynxman / zul ^^?

 16:24:31 <zul> Daviey: i think it might need to be rebased

 16:24:32 <smoser> i'll rebase to current archive and upload

 16:25:09 <lynxman> Yeah the issue wasn't solved in 2.6.1 debian
