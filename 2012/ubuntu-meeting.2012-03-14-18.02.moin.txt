 18:02:38 <bdmurray> #topic Previous Actions

 18:02:52 * bdmurray put list of dbus no reply bugs into a wiki page and email bugsquad regarding list: bdmurray

 18:03:07 <bdmurray> so I ended up just taking care of the dbus no reply bugs myself

 18:03:33 <bdmurray> so we can consider that done

 18:03:48 <bdmurray> that was the only action item from last week

 18:04:00 <bdmurray> #topic Engineering Team Bug Status

 18:04:33 <bdmurray> next week the foundations team is having an installer virtual sprint so that should be exciting

 18:05:06 <bdmurray> this past week I made a very short how to confirm a bug task video

 18:06:06 <bdmurray> http://youtu.be/Vl-cQDAlPFc

 18:06:22 <bdmurray> I plan on making some oethers but if you want to help let me know

 18:07:01 <bdmurray> I also updated screenshots and some documentation at help.ubuntu.com/community/BugReportingGuidelines

 18:07:56 <bdmurray> and I've uploaded a new version of firefox-lp-improvements which fixed a bug in the gmane link to a users bug activity

 18:08:02 <bdmurray> Ursinha: do you have anything?

 18:09:59 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: anything interesting happening in kernel land?

 18:10:18 <jsalisbury> There is an increase of bugs related to Lenovo ThinkPads overheating.

 18:10:38 <jsalisbury> However, it doesn't seem to be a regression, since I was able to reproduce the issue in Oneiric and Natty.

 18:10:41 <bdmurray> I've a thinkpad! what do I need to know

 18:11:14 <jsalisbury> If you run a very hight load, basically keeping the cpu at 100% utilized, the laptop may hit 100C and crash.

 18:11:45 <jsalisbury> It appears to be BIOS related, but the kernel team is getting in touch with Lenovo to see if we can overide the fan control in the thinkpad_acpi driver

 18:12:09 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: thanks, that is good to know

 18:12:18 <jsalisbury> The bug is bug 751689

 18:12:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 751689 in linux (Ubuntu Maverick) "ThinkPads overheat due to slow fans when on 'auto'" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/751689

 18:12:44 <jsalisbury> I can only reproduce it by running multiple kernel compiles at the same time.

 18:13:09 <jsalisbury> An partially blocking the fan exhaust, which may happen if you use the laptop "On your lap"

 18:13:11 <jsalisbury> :-)

 18:13:18 <bdmurray> heh

 18:13:36 <jsalisbury> We are also still keeping an eye out for any new RC6 related bugs.

 18:13:46 <jsalisbury> ..

 18:13:59 <Ursinha> I have nothing specific to report

 18:14:10 <Ursinha> unity related bugs stopped showing

 18:14:51 <Ursinha> rephrasing: unity bugs similar to what we had after beta 1 stopped showing

 18:14:59 <Ursinha> that must mean situation is under control now :)

 18:15:45 <bdmurray> I also made some more changes to the recent package bug graphs

 18:15:53 <bdmurray> for example http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-desktop/desktop-packages-recent-bug-tasks.html

 18:16:05 <bdmurray> labels now say this week and last week

 18:16:20 <bdmurray> the this week link becomes bold if this week > last week

 18:16:38 <Ursinha> I like it bdmurray

 18:16:44 <bdmurray> and there's a bit that says when the json file was updated

 18:17:13 <bdmurray> thanks Ursinha

 18:17:39 <bdmurray> moving on

 18:17:49 <bdmurray> #topic Bug Escalations (any High or Critical bugs that community members have seen that need attention)

 18:18:05 <wagafo> Somebody found a workaround to bug 527157  and bug 839281 that suggests adding a parameter at boot for the kernel. Could these bugs be in the kernel instead of gnome-power-manager and friends (the bug has been around for 2 years...).

 18:18:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 527157 in gnome-power-manager (Ubuntu) "Brightness controls skips Levels." [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/527157

 18:18:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 839281 in gnome-power-manager (Ubuntu) "Double brightness events after logging in." [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/839281

 18:19:16 <bdmurray> wagafo: what comment has the workaround?

 18:19:40 <wagafo> Sorry if this is not "high or critical" and does not belong. The workaround is adding a paramter for the kernel at boot.

 18:20:41 <bdmurray> oh maybe its the one that starts "Happy Birthday Bug ..."

 18:20:50 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: can you look at these?

 18:21:26 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, wagafo, sure I'll take a look and move them over to the kernel package if needed.

 18:22:25 <bdmurray> wagafo: while it isn't a high or critical bug thanks for bringing it up

 18:23:01 <wagafo> bdmurray: I have a couple more, should I also mention them?

 18:23:22 <bdmurray> wagafo: if a couple really means 2 sure. ;-)

 18:23:36 <wagafo> Bug 807259 seems to have all information and seems to me be easy to decide to weather fix or won't fix.

 18:23:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 807259 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "MetaRelease.download() Issue after Captive Portal" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/807259

 18:23:56 <bdmurray> okay, I'll take that one

 18:24:15 <wagafo> And the last one: Bug 872207. Can it be marked as triaged?

 18:24:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 872207 in Compiz "When Firefox is running in Unity, drop-down menus sometime close when opened" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/872207

 18:26:38 <bdmurray> Ursinha: can you look at that one?

 18:28:55 <bdmurray> wagafo: it looks like 872207 is incomplete and looking for some feedback

 18:29:35 <wagafo> bdmurray: OK, let me then go back to it and see if I can more info from the reporters

 18:29:59 <bdmurray> wagafo: also the description could use a better test case / steps to recreate the bug

 18:30:29 <wagafo> bdmurray: Ok, we'll try to improve the info there

 18:30:42 <bdmurray> wagafo: okay great thanks!

 18:30:51 <bdmurray> any other bugs we should be aware of?

 18:32:44 <bdmurray> #topic any other business

 18:32:54 <bdmurray> anything else worth discussing?

 18:33:27 <bdmurray> wagafo: if you run into other bugs you are concerned about feel free to use the bugsquad mailing list too

 18:33:42 <wagafo> bdmurray: OK

 18:35:53 <bdmurray> okay thanks everyone
