 00:00:44 <meetingology> Meeting started Fri Apr 20 00:00:44 2012 UTC.  The chair is pleia2. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 00:01:21 <pleia2> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the Americas meeting for April 19th. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

 00:01:29 <pleia2> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 00:01:38 <pleia2> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 00:01:48 <pleia2> ach applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 00:02:01 <pleia2> s/ach/Each

 00:02:09 <pleia2> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 00:02:19 <pleia2> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 00:04:57 <MrChrisDruif> Alright, for who doesn't know me I'm Chris Druif and I'm mainly involved with Lubuntu

 00:05:18 <MrChrisDruif> My wiki page is: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MrChrisDruif

 00:05:54 <MrChrisDruif> You can find all my contact info on there, including everything I don't really use like launchpad and ubuntuforums

 00:06:50 <MrChrisDruif> I've been the Wiki/Docs Coordinator of Lubuntu since January and today I've actually become a member of the Ubuntu Wiki Docs Editors

 00:07:03 <MrChrisDruif> Please feel free to ask any questions

 00:07:47 <pleia2> some of your testimonial writers did a better job of covering all the work you do than your wiki page does

 00:07:49 <MrChrisDruif> Oh, I also help out on Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter by updating the links for the flavor meetings and sometimes summaries

 00:07:55 <pleia2> there you go

 00:08:11 <MrChrisDruif> I'm not one to boast

 00:08:11 <pleia2> several testimonials from beginners team too

 00:08:48 <pleia2> thanks Unit193

 00:09:01 <MrChrisDruif> I think if you look at the raw version /Testimonials you'll see almost every page I've edited ^_^

 00:09:20 <MrChrisDruif> s//Testimonials//Contributions

 00:09:44 <pleia2> ah, good

 00:10:42 <MrChrisDruif> Any questions? Please ask if I forgot to mention anything

 00:11:25 <pleia2> s/that's/thanks

 00:11:29 <dinda> MrChrisDruif: you just made me very curious about Lubuntu!

 00:12:23 <MrChrisDruif> We've got a cool channel with people far more knowledgeable about Lubuntu then me on #lubuntu-offtopic and for support go to #lubuntu

 00:14:54 <Unit193> Wiki: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unit193 LP: http://launchpad.net/~unit193

 00:14:54 <Unit193> Howdy! My name is Unit 193, I'm from Ohio and part of the Ohio LoCo. Our city has a small ReLoCo that has had events I have gone to, I haven't been able to make any of the major statewide events as they have either been the wrong day, or I couldn't get there, but I really hope to make OLF this year.

 00:14:59 <Unit193> Unlike the person last month, my wiki seems to be stuck on -q mode as I am not a wiki person. :P  I am involved with the Lubuntu and Xubuntu projects, randomly help the news team if they really need it, and you can find me in random other places on and off Freenode.

 00:14:59 <MrChrisDruif> I'm rooting for ya Unit193 !!

 00:15:07 <Unit193> (Had to prewrite or I'd go blank)

 00:15:53 <pleia2> caravena: thanks for joining us, we'll get to your application next :)

 00:16:22 <cyphermox> Unit193: no problem, a lot of this meeting is scripted ;)

 00:16:50 <knome> as i state in the wiki, Unit193 gets +1 from me

 00:16:52 <caravena> pleia2 ok

 00:17:00 <MrChrisDruif> Same here

 00:17:08 <Unit193> Thanks.

 00:17:10 * SergioMeneses takes seat

 00:17:12 <pleia2> thanks knome and MrChrisDruif

 00:17:24 <nhandler> Unit193: Any plans to get involved with that ISO adoption project?

 00:17:45 <Unit193> Does it go by any other name?

 00:18:10 <Unit193> I may not have heard of it, so I'd have to check it out.

 00:18:22 <nhandler> Unit193: Let me find a link (I admit, I'm not the most familiar)

 00:18:32 <pleia2> http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2012/04/would-you-adopt-iso.html

 00:19:00 <pleia2> it's a more formal adoption of the iso tests you already do, to be responsible for a particular set of tests for an iso getting finished

 00:19:12 <knome> if those iso's cover xubuntu iso's, i will +1 for Unit193 doing that too ;)

 00:19:19 <nhandler> Yep, that was it. Thanks pleia2

 00:19:20 <pleia2> it does!

 00:19:27 <knome> (otherwise, only +.99)

 00:19:31 <pleia2> hehe

 00:19:42 <Unit193> Hardware is a bit limited, and I can't hit any 64bit, but I can hit 32.

 00:20:15 <nhandler> I'm sure many people would appreciate the help

 00:20:47 <knome> yes, definitely, especially if it is on the derivative images (whether that was xubuntu or lubuntu or any other)

 00:21:52 <Unit193> I'd love to help with that, but it'd be hard commiting to it as the computer that has the power to test the best is a shared computer, so I'd have to check. (Also,  affew real life events I have to work with)

 00:21:59 <pleia2> another thank you for including future info so we don't need to ask :)

 00:37:49 <cyphermox> cyrex: you there?

 00:38:08 <cyrex> I am here cyphermox

 00:38:09 <pleia2> #topic cyrex Membership

 00:38:17 <cyphermox> alright :)

 00:38:32 <cyrex> hello

 00:38:42 <cyrex> Should I start now?

 00:39:03 <cyrex> Sorry guys a LITTLE nervous

 00:39:03 <pleia2> yes, go ahead

 00:39:13 <cyrex> I am Luis Alvarado from Venezuela. Have been an active Ubuntu user since 5.04. Started helping other users with Linux and Ubuntu since 2006-2007, at least for user from Windows. Have taught several Linux classes that focus on Ubuntu, the server side and desktop side. Also participated in an international event called FLISOL (Will participate this year again). My time right now is spend in askubuntu helping out, teaching/promoting about Ubuntu Linux in

 00:39:13 <cyrex> Venezuela and I am going to start my webpage ubuntuve.com from scratch which will be about video tutorials about Ubuntu and programming in Linux (Spanish mostly).

 00:39:25 <cyrex> https://launchpad.net/~luisalvaradox (Empty for the time being. Got a couple of tools I want to add this year)

 00:39:33 <cyrex> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/luisalvarado

 00:39:48 <cyrex> This is a link to askubuntu where I do some helping: http://askubuntu.com/users/7035/

 00:40:09 <cyrex> And here is a link to the ranking so it might help or something: http://askubuntu.com/users?tab=reputation&filter=all

 00:40:29 <pleia2> always nice to meet other folks who are putting Ubuntu into schools :)

 00:40:40 <pleia2> wow, you've been using askubuntu for a long time!

 00:40:42 <MrChrisDruif> That's true

 00:41:26 <cyrex> yes. About a year

 00:41:39 <pleia2> cyrex: is teaching Venezuelan Users about Ubuntu something separate from your job?

 00:42:04 <cyrex> I do it in the job and separate

 00:42:09 <pleia2> great

 00:42:29 <cyrex> for example, when talking about networking, computer assembly or programming I always talk to them about linux and ubuntu

 00:42:47 <cyrex> so many of them eventually take the linux course which I teach using ubuntu

 00:43:12 <cyrex> that is in the job, outside the job and help out friends and anybody interested in using a real operating system

 00:43:20 <pleia2> :)

 00:43:55 <pleia2> really great work

 00:44:12 <cyrex> I have a small group in facebook with some friends that I help with this. Also have ubuntuve.com/ubuntuvenezuela.com which I will start from scratch with video tutorials of how to use ubuntu, configuration, etc.

 00:44:25 <nhandler> Besides the videos, any other plans/goals for the future?

 00:46:18 <cyrex> Well my 2012 goals in order are: Finish ubuntu tutorials on webpage, finish symfony programming and I want to start working on python so I can help with Ubuntu. Right now my plan is to create awareness of ubuntu in Venezuela and maybe a social group around it. Then try to work my way up to someday maybe work in Ubuntu as a developer.
