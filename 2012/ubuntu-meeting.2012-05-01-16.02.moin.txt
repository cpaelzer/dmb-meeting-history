 16:02:29 <utlemming> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:32 <s3h> \o

 16:02:58 <utlemming> :( we seem to be missing logs from last week....so we'll wing it

 16:03:15 <utlemming> Anyone have any topics from last week?

 16:03:39 <SpamapS> We didn't really have any

 16:03:45 <utlemming> I didn't think we would

 16:03:48 <SpamapS> hence my not putting any in the agenda

 16:04:07 <SpamapS> I did forget to post the meetingology logs, whoops

 16:04:16 <utlemming> We do have one glaring elephant in the room....well done all on the Precise's release

 16:04:34 <arosales> +1

 16:04:48 <SpamapS> *\o/*

 16:04:55 <zul> sheesh finally..

 16:04:57 <SpamapS> +12.04

 16:05:05 <arosales> breaking out the pom poms SpamapS :-)

 16:05:16 <SpamapS> I never really put them away actually.. :)

 16:05:28 <arosales> who does, right?

 16:05:35 <SpamapS> only the non-believers

 16:05:45 <jamespage> **\o/**

 16:06:11 <utlemming> well, moving on....

 16:06:19 <utlemming> #topic Quantal Development

 16:06:36 <arosales> 5 bugs we are tracking @ http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:06:56 <arosales> SpamapS: are you working on bug 930916

 16:06:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930916 in amavisd-new (Ubuntu) "amavis start-stop script fails to stop amavisd" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930916

 16:07:51 <SpamapS> arosales: no, but I promise to look at it this week

 16:08:00 <SpamapS> At this point though

 16:08:03 <arosales> SpamapS: ok, thanks

 16:08:04 <SpamapS> those are all just SRU's

 16:08:06 <arosales> s3h: is the workaround still valid for bug 974584?

 16:08:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 16:08:16 <arosales> that was my next question, are all these candidates for SRUs?

 16:08:45 <arosales> SpamapS: so  bug 930916 is a SRU candidate, correct?

 16:08:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930916 in amavisd-new (Ubuntu) "amavis start-stop script fails to stop amavisd" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930916

 16:09:19 <s3h> arosales: yes

 16:09:42 <arosales> s3h: for 974584 is there also a fix?

 16:09:49 <s3h> not yet

 16:09:54 <s3h> needs to be done in initscripts

 16:10:01 <s3h> i is fjeered of those

 16:10:05 <SpamapS> arosales: all of those are.. if they were release tracked they were important enough to want in precise.

 16:10:07 <arosales> ok, is that a SRU ?

 16:10:16 <arosales> SpamapS: ok

 16:10:20 <s3h> is which SRU?

 16:10:22 * arosales will stop asking then

 16:10:35 <arosales> s3h: bug 974584 for an SRU once the fix is available

 16:10:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974584 in sysvinit (Ubuntu) "Semaphores cannot be created in lxc container" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974584

 16:10:52 <arosales> but SpamapS just enlightened me :-)

 16:10:57 <s3h> no.  workaround is fine for precise and lower

 16:11:08 <s3h> only need a initscript fix in q+

 16:11:14 <arosales> s3h: ah ok.

 16:11:40 <arosales> next bug on the list

 16:11:42 <arosales> bug 880339

 16:11:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 880339 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu Precise) "AppArmor profile needs update" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/880339

 16:11:50 <SpamapS> still no response

 16:11:52 <arosales> looks to be marked as incomplete

 16:12:05 <arosales> same with the next one, bug 907197

 16:12:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 907197 in nova (Ubuntu) "ip address can't be injected into the instance when using lxc " [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/907197

 16:12:20 <arosales> an of course openstack

 16:12:22 <arosales> bug 901881

 16:12:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova and glance should depend on python-keystone" [Low,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:12:46 <SpamapS> those statuses are not always reliable tho

 16:12:48 <arosales> zul: looks like you are working on that one

 16:13:03 <SpamapS> err, n/m those are right

 16:13:16 <arosales> ok, I'll circle back to bug 907197

 16:13:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 907197 in nova (Ubuntu) "ip address can't be injected into the instance when using lxc " [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/907197

 16:13:19 <zul> arosales: yeah need to get quantal open first

 16:13:25 <arosales> jamespage: sill no response on that one?

 16:13:38 <arosales> zul: ok, thanks.

 16:13:47 <jamespage> arosales, no

 16:13:53 <jamespage> and no one else can repro

 16:14:02 <arosales> jamespage: ok so incomplete still valid.

 16:14:10 <jamespage> yes

 16:14:35 <arosales> and wrap up on blueprints

 16:14:37 <arosales> for P

 16:14:40 <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:14:57 <arosales> 95% overall status.

 16:15:25 <arosales> I guess at this point we should be making new blueprints, and postponing and past work items.

 16:15:26 <zul> wh00t

 16:15:28 <SpamapS> wait, precise is released

 16:15:38 <SpamapS> its 100% whether our graphs show it or not :)

 16:15:47 <arosales> :-)

 16:15:58 <arosales> rbasak: can you take a look at servercloud-p-arm-service-orchestration

 16:16:35 <arosales> that one shows 92%, but I am not seeing the work items that still needs to be done.

 16:17:10 <rbasak> arosales: hmm, nor do I

 16:17:15 <SpamapS> Validate IPMI on hardware: BLOCKED

 16:17:21 <arosales> zul: does  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack need updated

 16:17:21 <rbasak> Oh

 16:17:27 <rbasak> thanks SpamapS

 16:17:34 <arosales> looks like MIR is in progress for horizon

 16:17:41 <zul> arosales: ill update it

 16:17:46 <m_3> do we manually copy postponed items from p blueprints to q blueprints?

 16:17:46 <arosales> zul thanks

 16:17:52 <SpamapS> anything still open should be moved to POSTPONED. If we need to get it done, thats a new BP for quantal

 16:17:55 <rbasak> Now postponed. We never got hardware for that.

 16:18:24 <SpamapS> Or tack it onto something related for quantal

 16:18:31 <ScottK> SpamapS: It'd be nice if you assigned yourself the postfix stuff you didn't do last cycle so you can defer it again later.

 16:18:36 <arosales> s3h: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-lxc also showing some tasks remaining

 16:19:07 <arosales> rbasak: could you take a  quick look at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-arm-system-management

 16:19:14 <s3h> oh?

 16:19:38 <s3h> yeah but that's smoser's :)

 16:19:38 <arosales> SpamapS: and M_3 I think are still working https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-juju-charm-testing

 16:19:47 <s3h> i'll postpone it

 16:19:55 <arosales> s3h:  thanks

 16:20:06 <smoser> which is mine?

 16:20:09 <rbasak> arosales: postponed

 16:20:13 <arosales> rbasak: thanks

 16:20:14 <SpamapS> ScottK: that stings. ;)

 16:20:22 <s3h> smoser: open bug for libvirt to check capsys-module, capmac*:

 16:20:30 <smoser> got it.

 16:20:36 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cloud-ha also has some open tasks

 16:20:43 <ScottK> SpamapS: Eventually you're going to get tired of the exit 75 bugs and do something.

 16:20:57 <arosales> ivoks has a todo there

 16:21:27 <arosales> adam_g: are you still working on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack-charms ?

 16:22:01 <m_3> arosales: that remaining blocked item in juju-charm-testing can be postponed I think

 16:22:03 <SpamapS> ScottK: I did!

 16:22:25 <SpamapS> ScottK: there's a bug pattern. But we give users the option to still submit it.

 16:22:35 <ScottK> I see.

 16:22:36 <SpamapS> ScottK: which, perhaps we should take away. :)

 16:22:44 <arosales> m_3: thanks

 16:22:59 <arosales> s3h: another one that has your name https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-libvirt

 16:23:07 <ScottK> SpamapS: Since exit 75 is by definition not a bug, as long as we explain it, I think that makes sense.

 16:23:11 <arosales> s3h: [serge-hallyn] enable netcf: BLOCKED

 16:23:23 <adam_g> arosales: i thought i closed that one out . i was working on the swift stuff last week but blocked on a juju bug

 16:23:25 <arosales> utlemming: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-pushing-cloud

 16:23:26 <SpamapS> ScottK: I think we wanted to get some feedback from affected users who thought their hostname was ok.

 16:23:27 <s3h> i figurd blocked = postponed

 16:23:34 <adam_g> arosales: when that fix lands i plan on finishing up.

 16:23:40 <SpamapS> blocked must be postponed at this point

 16:23:43 <arosales> adam_g:  thanks

 16:23:43 <SpamapS> there is no DONE

 16:23:49 <SpamapS> DONE is for Q :)

 16:23:57 <SpamapS> start piling up green for Q now :)

 16:24:28 <arosales> jamespage: could you follow up on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-p-java

 16:24:47 <arosales> ok, those are the ones I saw on my quick scan

 16:25:03 <jamespage> arosales, thats getting a revised spec for quantal

 16:25:09 <arosales> jamespage: ok thanks

 16:25:28 <arosales> also make sure blueprints for Q are submitted

 16:25:34 <arosales> especially ones that need sessions

 16:26:01 <arosales> unless anyone else had any other blueprint comments

 16:26:08 <arosales> utlemming: back to you

 16:26:12 <utlemming> :)

 16:31:20 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:31:30 <utlemming> rbasak: do you have anything for us today?

 16:31:31 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:32:15 <SpamapS> rbasak: I can has? (Buy) one?

 16:32:56 <rbasak> SpamapS: I'm not sure about that. But as of Thursday, you can install Ubuntu Server on it!

 16:33:19 * SpamapS installs Ubuntu Server on all sorts of mythical hardware in his sleep

 16:33:25 <m_3> :)

 16:34:06 <utlemming> #topic Open Discussion

 16:34:47 <SpamapS> I wanted to bring up just one thing about UDS

 16:34:55 <utlemming> don

 16:34:57 <utlemming> don

 16:35:02 <SpamapS> Please make sure you come to UDS with points of decision to make, not just poitns of discussion.

 16:35:03 <utlemming> don't drink too much?

 16:35:05 <lynxman> *suspense music*

 16:35:15 <SpamapS> Start the discussions now, on the mailing lists.

 16:35:31 <SpamapS> Make sure people know the positions and facts before hand.

 16:35:39 <SpamapS> Come with facts, and then the process will go much smoother.

 16:36:15 * SpamapS deposits his $0.02 in your brains, and shuts up.

 16:36:18 <m_3> SpamapS: _now_ you tell us

 16:36:28 <zul> SpamapS: also make sure you come prepared

 16:37:02 <utlemming> any other topics?

 16:37:21 <arosales> again, job well done on precise

 16:37:32 <utlemming> #topic Announce next meeting data and time

 16:37:54 <arosales> meeting next week?

 16:38:03 <utlemming> Tues 15th May 1600 UTC -- back here again!

 16:38:27 <utlemming> My understanding is that since it is UDS, we skip it.

 16:38:35 <arosales> makes sense

 16:38:44 <utlemming> #endmeeting
