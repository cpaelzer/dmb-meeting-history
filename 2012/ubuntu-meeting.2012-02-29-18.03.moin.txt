 18:03:54 <bdmurray> #topic Previous Actions

 18:04:10 * bdmurray put list of dbus no reply bugs into a wiki page and email bugsquad regarding list: bdmurray

 18:04:22 <bdmurray> I've not done this yet, so will carry it over

 18:04:34 * bdmurray investigate bug 827615: Ursinha

 18:04:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 827615 in software-center (Ubuntu Precise) "software-center crashed with TypeError in show_available_packages(): this constructor takes no arguments" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/827615

 18:04:46 <Ursinha> done

 18:04:55 <bdmurray> done and fix released!

 18:05:10 <s9iper1> thanks ursinha:

 18:05:27 <Ursinha> fix was already committed when that bug was raised, they just released it :)

 18:05:41 <Ursinha> no problem, they did all the dirty job!

 18:05:47 <bdmurray> still good news

 18:05:58 <Ursinha> indeed sir

 18:06:03 <bdmurray> #topic Engineering Team Bug Status

 18:06:16 <bdmurray> Ursinha: any thing interesting?

 18:06:27 <Ursinha> nothing that could be reported right now

 18:07:14 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: anything on your side?

 18:10:47 <bdmurray> not much from me, however I'm looking into an issue where apport-crash reports with python tracebacks are missing data

 18:10:54 <bdmurray> for example bug 943340

 18:10:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 943340 in Ubuntu "oneconf-query crashed with DBusException in call_blocking(): org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name :1.443 was not provided by any .service files" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/943340

 18:11:44 <bdmurray> if you happen to report one of these I'm interested in the .crash file from the system in happened on too

 18:11:58 <bdmurray> that'd be located in /var/crash

 18:13:20 <bdmurray> #topic Bug Escalations (any High or Critical bugs that community members have seen that need attention)

 18:13:49 <bdmurray> so are there any bugs that aren't getting the attention they deserve?

 18:15:38 <bdmurray> okay nothing this week then

 18:15:48 <bdmurray> #topic Other Topics

 18:15:57 <hggdh> \o

 18:15:57 <bdmurray> any thing else to discuss?

 18:16:02 <bdmurray> hggdh: yes?

 18:16:31 <hggdh> I would like to officially welcome mfish as the newest Bug Control member

 18:17:07 <bdmurray> hggdh: I saw that, that's great!

 18:17:11 <hggdh> I do hope he keeps on helping!

 18:17:17 <hggdh> ..

 18:18:14 <bdmurray> oh Ursinha do you know what package I'd want to report a bug about for the login splash screen?  Is it lightdm or some theme?

 18:19:34 <dlentz> bdmurray, are you getting a light purple screen? (i have that issue with 12.04, but i didn't know if it was because i'm using xubuntu)

 18:20:06 <bdmurray> dlentz: no, I'm concerned about the text there '12.04' doesn't have LTS after it

 18:20:28 <dlentz> oh, you mean plymouth splash screen?

 18:20:49 <bdmurray> dlentz: no, I mean the one lightdm one where I log in

 18:21:14 <dlentz> oh, ok, i guess i've only seen the xubuntu default

 18:21:24 <bdmurray> well it looks like logo.png in the unity-greeter package

 18:22:03 <bdmurray> anything else?

 18:23:15 <bdmurray> okay, thanks everyone
