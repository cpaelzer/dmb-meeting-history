 18:03:24 <bdmurray> #topic Previous Actions

 18:03:34 * bdmurray bdmurray to perform SRU of fix for bug 904527 for Oneiric

 18:03:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 904527 in rhythmbox (Ubuntu Oneiric) "apport package hook no longer installed" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/904527

 18:04:00 <bdmurray> Pedro had asked that I upload a fix for Oneiric for that

 18:04:11 <bdmurray> which I've done but it could use verification

 18:04:40 <bdmurray> Its really simple ;-) just make sure /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/source_rhythmbox.py exists!

 18:05:08 <bdmurray> So if anybody still running Oneiric could check that out it'd be much appreciated

 18:05:56 <bdmurray> moving on

 18:06:01 <Ursinha> (I can do that)

 18:06:14 <bdmurray> Ursinha: that'd be great!

 18:06:18 <Ursinha> :)

 18:07:07 <bdmurray> #topic Engineering Team Bug Status

 18:07:36 <bdmurray> Ursinha: do you have anything for us?

 18:07:43 <Ursinha> bdmurray, not really no

 18:08:05 <bdmurray> Ursinha: oh with regards to that openoffice package install failure bug

 18:08:17 <bdmurray> come to find out apport wasn't checking bug patterns in precise

 18:08:21 <bdmurray> this is fixed now

 18:08:28 <Ursinha> oh, argh and cool :)

 18:08:34 <Ursinha> thanks for fixing the world, bdmurray :)

 18:08:55 <bdmurray> In all fairness pitti fixed it, I just found it. ;-)

 18:09:05 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: Do you have anything to report?

 18:09:06 <Ursinha> which is fairly important too ;)

 18:09:37 <jsalisbury> Just a heads up, there are a bunch of duplicates coming in for bug 917962

 18:09:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917962 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/3/0/0x10000100" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917962

 18:09:56 <jsalisbury> This bug seems to have only started today.  I'm in the process of bisecting to find what caused the regression.

 18:10:30 <bdmurray> I wouldn't say its only started today, we might now just be seeing it since I turned on kerneloops

 18:10:46 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, ahh, yes, correct

 18:10:49 <Ursinha> bdmurray, you turned on kerneloops again?

 18:11:17 <bdmurray> Ursinha: yes, I disabled the question regarding uploading it to kerneloops.org and enabled kerneloops again

 18:11:23 <Ursinha> great :)

 18:11:27 * Ursinha takes notes

 18:11:42 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, it's doing its job ;-)

 18:12:03 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: yeah so it seems.  let me know if you need any help writing a bug pattern for that bug

 18:12:12 <balloons> hehe, I feel like I should be afraid to update today...

 18:12:30 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, will do.  I'll create the bug pattern once the root cause is identified.

 18:13:02 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: why wait? duplicates will just keep coming in

 18:13:08 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, That's the only major update I have.

 18:13:25 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, Just need to have time later today.

 18:13:55 <bdmurray> jsalisbury: okay, I wasn't sure if it was hardware specific or something

 18:14:19 <bdmurray> So as previously mentioned I've turned on kerneloops now

 18:14:19 <jsalisbury> bdmurray, no I don't believe so.  I should have the pattern done this afternoon.

 18:14:51 <bdmurray> I also uploaded an updated update-manager apport package hook to include Aptdaemon messages from syslog

 18:15:36 <bdmurray> And there will be a new version of firefox-lp-improvements shortly

 18:15:45 <bdmurray> That'll fix bug 917461

 18:15:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917461 in Launchpad Greasemonkey Scripts "stock replies do not work in Firefox" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917461

 18:16:26 <bdmurray> #topic Bug Escalations (any High or Critical bugs that community members have seen that need attention)

 18:16:53 <bdmurray> Are there any bugs that we need to be aware of or that need some love?

 18:18:49 <bdmurray> okay that's good news I hope

 18:19:00 <bdmurray> #topic Other Topics

 18:19:16 <bdmurray> Speaking of SRU verifications

 18:19:49 <bdmurray> There is a version of update-manager in oneiric proposed that could use some verification

 18:19:54 <bdmurray> it fixes bug 880704

 18:19:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 880704 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "On kubuntu, update-manager hook crashes with ImportError: No module named gconf in hookutils.py attach_gconf" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/880704

 18:20:03 <bdmurray> bug 873432 and bug 873424

 18:20:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 873432 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "check-new-release-gtk: Release Notes link/button doesn't send to a release notes page" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/873432

 18:20:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 873424 in update-manager (Ubuntu Oneiric) "ask me later fails" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/873424

 18:21:26 <bdmurray> I'm familiar with the bugs if anybody needs help verifying them

 18:21:49 <bdmurray> Is there anything else to discuss?

 18:25:41 <bdmurray> Well then, thanks everyone
