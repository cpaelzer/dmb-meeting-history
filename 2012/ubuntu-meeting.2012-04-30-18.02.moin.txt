 18:02:26 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Announcements

 18:02:31 <mdeslaur> thanks to jtaylor for his help on security updates for the community supported dropbear last week. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 18:02:45 <mdeslaur> There are a lot of merge opportunities for packages listed in http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/. Performing these updates is a great way to help Ubuntu and bolster your developer application.

 18:02:57 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:03:00 <mdeslaur> I'll go first

 18:03:14 <mdeslaur> I'm working on testing a couple of updates, and will be preparing my laptop for UDS

 18:03:40 <mdeslaur> and I'm on triage, so I'll be skeet-shooting CVEs and bugs

 18:03:47 <mdeslaur> that's it from me

 18:03:55 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: tag, you're it

 18:04:03 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place

 18:04:17 <sbeattie> I'm working on an apparmor SRU for precise

 18:04:38 <mdeslaur> cool

 18:04:39 <sbeattie> I'm also doing UDS prep and will try to pick up an update as well.

 18:04:50 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me.

 18:05:01 <sbeattie> micahg: you're up

 18:05:17 <mdeslaur> micahg is going to be late

 18:05:19 <mdeslaur> tyhicks: you're up

 18:05:21 <micahg> I'm working on Thunderbird 12.0.1, apparmor SRUs for the Firefox/Thunderbird path changes

 18:05:27 <mdeslaur> oh!

 18:05:29 <mdeslaur> micahg: sorry :)

 18:05:34 * micahg is here :)

 18:06:26 <micahg> tyhicks: you're up

 18:07:02 <tyhicks> I'm on community this week

 18:07:13 <tyhicks> I'm finishing up testing of an update for an embargoed issue and will publish it this afternoon/evening

 18:07:27 <tyhicks> I have another embargoed issue to work on after that

 18:07:35 <tyhicks> top secret status this week :)

 18:07:57 <mdeslaur> tyhicks: hehe :)

 18:07:57 <tyhicks> and I need to update a few UDS blueprints and subscribe to a number of others

 18:08:03 <tyhicks> I think that is it

 18:08:06 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 18:09:31 <jjohansen> I have a little more work to do on the apparmor SRU for precise as well, some more testing of the kernel patches etc

 18:09:31 <jjohansen> I am also working on the dbus prototype so we can get it back up and in a ppa before uds

 18:09:54 <jjohansen> besides that the usual UDS prep/pulling out of hair wondering how UDS has snuck up on me again

 18:10:20 <jjohansen> thats it for me mdeslaur back to you

 18:10:47 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: time flies when you're having kernel fun

 18:10:58 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:11:05 <mdeslaur> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
