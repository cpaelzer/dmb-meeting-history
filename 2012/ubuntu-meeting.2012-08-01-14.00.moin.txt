 14:03:35 <smartboyhw> We will have Ubuntu 12.04.1 on week 17 (August 23rd)

 14:03:50 <smartboyhw> Did anyone test these builds, the Precise ones?

 14:04:36 <smartboyhw> We'd better test those builds in the coming weeks ahead

 14:05:22 <smartboyhw> So that's all from me, then...

 14:05:34 <smartboyhw> Balloons please add more information, if you would like to

 14:07:24 <smartboyhw> No info from Balloons, so let's move on

 14:07:26 <balloons> Sure, next week we'll be testing the daily iso's as part of our testing cadence, but as smartboyhw mentioned, during this week you have the oppurtunity to help with webapps

 14:07:38 <balloons> ..
