 22:01:43 <IdleOne> ok so who is here from the board?

 22:01:47 <s-fox> o/

 22:01:47 <greg-g> o/

 22:01:49 <cjohnston> o/

 22:01:51 <IdleOne> o/

 22:01:51 * hggdh pays attention now

 22:02:04 <IdleOne> alright lets get this party started

 22:02:14 <metasansana> woot

 22:02:18 <IdleOne> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 22:00 UTC meeting for June 21, 2012. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:02:34 <IdleOne> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:02:45 <IdleOne> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:02:56 <IdleOne> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:02:57 <IdleOne> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:03:18 <IdleOne> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:03:18 <IdleOne> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant is rye

 22:03:31 <IdleOne> rye, introduce yourself :)

 22:03:44 <greg-g> hi there rye

 22:03:48 <iulian> I.e. the stage is all yours, rye.

 22:03:52 <rye> Hello, I am Roman Yepishev, currently working on Ubuntu One projects and had been using Ubuntu for last 9 years.

 22:04:20 <rye> The last 3 of which I have actually started to understand the value of the community in such a project.

 22:04:37 <IdleOne> rye, please provide LP link and wiki link

 22:05:09 <rye> My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RomanYepishev and launchpad profile is https://launchpad.net/~rye. To some I may be known by indicator-ubuntuone project

 22:05:46 <cjohnston> yay for that

 22:05:50 <iulian> rye: Are you sure it's 9 years? That's a bit too much, isn't it?

 22:06:10 <rye> wait, 2006

 22:06:19 <mfisch> that would 6 six years

 22:06:28 <rye> iulian: 9 years of linux experience, 6 years of Ubuntu, you are right

 22:06:39 <greg-g> heh, 2012 - 9 = 2003, pre even no-name-yet.com :)

 22:07:08 <iulian> rye: Oh, OK.

 22:07:56 <greg-g> rye: is there an Ubuntu Ukraine LoCo team?

 22:08:11 <rye> Apart from counting dates poorely I have been extremely active (well, by my standards) during 12.04 release where I kept testing Ubuntu on every machine I had in posession leading to quite a few early fixed bugs that I am personally proud about.

 22:08:35 <greg-g> that's awesome

 22:09:06 <cjohnston> I'm proud of the indicator for you :-)

 22:09:39 <rye> greg-g: There is not a formal one, a disperse "community" primarily active on the web site of linux.org.ua. Upon my recent visit to OSDN.ua (open source development conference) last year I was the craziest ubuntu person there

 22:09:57 <greg-g> haha :)

 22:10:17 <greg-g> do you think there is an oppotunity for someone to take the reigns of a Ubuntu-UA and make it work?

 22:10:29 <rye> What means that I was asking people about how they feel about the latest release and all that.

 22:10:48 <IdleOne> #voters s-fox greg-g cjohnston IdleOne PabloRubianes

 22:11:22 <hggdh> IdleOne: do not forget me

 22:11:31 <IdleOne> ok

 22:11:33 <rye> greg-g: I think that can be done. I have had several presentations of Ubuntu (CouchDB and Ubuntu One) in local internet center which had gathered some interested people so I guess that may be an interesting task to pursue

 22:13:27 <hggdh> rye: welcome in. Please do keep the good work

 22:13:32 <reavengrey> You are now an illuminati...

 22:13:32 <greg-g> and seriously, thanks for your hard work on my stupid U1 file disappearing problem ;)

 22:13:55 <IdleOne> ok next person is going to be nspirit

 22:13:58 <rye> iulian: I will ask for testimonials because, yes, it is not really visible that somebody actually knows (or have seen) me

 22:14:05 <IdleOne> nspirit here?

 22:14:22 <iulian> rye: Brilliant. Thanks.

 22:14:28 <IdleOne> Going once...

 22:14:38 <IdleOne> Twice...

 22:14:46 <hggdh> as a rule of thumb for candidates: testimonials help a lot

 22:14:59 <IdleOne> sold

 22:15:13 <IdleOne> Next... rubylaser you are up. Please introduce yourself

 22:16:11 <s-fox> rubylaser ?

 22:16:12 <rubylaser> Hi, I'm Zack Reed.  I've been on Debian/Ubuntu since Debian Woody.  I love open source and I am a very active member on the Ubuntu Forums

 22:16:59 <IdleOne> rubylaser, link us to LP and wiki please.

 22:18:46 <IdleOne> rubylaser, Do you have anybody here to support you "in person"

 22:18:48 <IdleOne> ?

 22:19:00 <iulian> rubylaser: What are your future plans for Ubuntu?

 22:19:13 <rubylaser> I asked CharlesA and a few other forum members to attend, I but don't see any of them in the channel :/

 22:19:55 <reavengrey> I'm thinking firmware rootkits to prevent lesser things like archlinux and OS/X from booting, shipped with release 12.10, idk if you guys are into that

 22:20:04 <rubylaser> I would love to see Ubuntu's use continue to grow especially in the corporate environment (where I work).

 22:20:29 <s-fox> rubylaser,  you contributions seem to be forums based, perhaps it would be easier for you to gain membership via the forum council ?

 22:30:01 <balloons> Hello, my name is Nicholas Skaggs. Currently, I serve as a part of the community team for Canonical with a focus on QA. My goal is to see ubuntu become a leader in quality among open source projects. I began using linux about the same time as ubuntu was beginning as a project. I found debian, and then ubuntu. It's been running on my machines ever since. My wiki page https://launchpad.net/~nskaggs and lp page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/balloons

 22:38:02 <lynxman> Hi everyone o/ I'm Marc Cluet I've been running Ubuntu since hardy and any form of Linux since 1.2.13

 22:38:05 <lynxman> Wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/lynxman and LP https://launchpad.net/~lynxman

 22:38:10 <lynxman> I've been quite active on the server side since natty, carrying a lot of work on mcollective, mcollective-plugins, rabbitmq-server, puppet, cloudfoundry and swift

 22:38:14 <lynxman> I've also been an active code contributor to cloud-init

 22:38:18 <lynxman> I've been also involved with juju from the beginning I'm one of the first juju charmers

 22:38:21 <lynxman> I've been also doing bug triaging (seldomly) helping the Server Team on it

 22:38:24 <lynxman> And I've also organised the keysign parties for the last two UDS on my own (to a varied degree of success)

 22:38:29 <lynxman> (that's all I can think of right now)

 22:38:57 <IdleOne> doesn't seem like you do very much really :P

 22:39:13 <lynxman> IdleOne: I change contexts way too much :)

 22:39:16 <bkerensa> lynxman does good work in the Juju community he is how I found out about Juju

 22:39:30 <lynxman> bkerensa: thanks o/

 22:39:38 <IdleOne> thank you bkerensa

 22:40:18 <bkerensa> anyone who can evangelize Juju in front of a crowd of hardcore Puppet fans gets me +1 :)

 22:42:36 <IdleOne> lynxman, do you do anything with your loco?

 22:42:48 <lynxman> IdleOne: I attend regularly to release parties

 22:42:55 <lynxman> IdleOne: I've also attended to Loco meetings in Montreal

 22:45:51 <cjohnston> yay

 22:46:00 <mfisch> should we clean up the wiki page by removing our names?

 22:46:07 <IdleOne> Next up we have trinikrono, please intro yourself

 22:46:11 <trinikrono> Good Evening Everyone, my name is Kurt Belgrave and i hail from the caribbean islands called trinidad and tobago. I started to use ubuntu in 2009 and decided to get invovled in the community in 2010.

 22:46:26 <IdleOne> mfisch, thanks for volunteering to do that :)

 22:46:30 <trinikrono> this is my wikipage https://wiki.ubuntu.com/trinikrono

 22:46:34 <mfisch> d'oh!

 22:46:44 <mfisch> IdleOne: remove everyone from this time slot?

 22:46:45 <trinikrono> and LP https://launchpad.net/~trinikrono

 22:47:03 <IdleOne> mfisch, yeah, soon as we are done.

 22:47:10 <trinikrono> basically i am pushing Ubuntu in my country and moving to help other caribbean islands

 22:47:17 <s-fox> let's finish the meeting before we edit the wiki ;)

 22:47:22 <trinikrono> with there LoCo teams also

 22:47:31 <mfisch> (sorry I made one change already)

 22:48:19 <iulian> trinikrono: How is it going so far?

 22:48:46 <trinikrono> well it is going great as far i am concerned, since when i started it was me alone

 22:49:04 <greg-g> trinikrono: it seems like there is some activity in the LoCo, based on the events and web accounts, do you have any plans on going to Approved LoCo status in the future?

 22:49:06 <trinikrono> and now i have people in the launchpad team and in a facebook group

 22:49:16 <iulian> trinikrono: How many are you now, roughly?

 22:49:24 <trinikrono> there are some issues with exposure down here as people arent used to open source projects

 22:49:31 * greg-g nods

 22:49:33 <trinikrono> but i am getting lots of help

 22:49:41 <iulian> Right. That's good.

 22:49:51 <trinikrono> between 10-20 in the team

 22:49:53 <Xai> count me in

 22:50:00 <Xai> i'll write the tests

 22:50:03 <trinikrono> but the facebook group has a lot more members

 22:50:25 * reavengrey is from Trinidad and Tobago

 22:50:46 <metasansana> me too :/

 22:50:48 <trinichica> Me too

 22:50:50 <reavengrey> I recently got to know about trinikrono 's efforts through another channel locally, which is a cyber cafe run by another very active ubuntu enthusiast

 22:51:01 <greg-g> interesting

 22:51:03 <reavengrey> Who has been doing ubuntu server installations all across the island

 22:51:05 <Xai> trinikrono: you look diff in your wiki compared to here in irc

 22:51:07 <reavengrey> As of now

 22:51:12 <greg-g> do you all have a loco irc channel?

 22:51:15 <metasansana> ubuntu tt is the only software movement seeing any success

 22:51:21 <trinikrono> yes it is #ubuntu-tt

 22:51:27 <reavengrey> Yes, #ubuntu-tt

 22:51:56 <reavengrey> Kurt is very driven, and he has a lot of enthusiasm which I found very interesting

 22:51:59 <trinikrono> yes we have some interesting things to get the irc going

 22:52:12 <palladin35y> me too

 22:52:18 <trinichica> Trinikrono is the best at Ubuntu Community support not only in Trinidad and Tobago but in the entire Caribbean. He currently helps the Ubuntu team in Dominica and even yesterday he hosted a meeting at the first Ubuntu Internet cafe in Trinidad that he helped grow. :) With his support others and myself got lots of help to use this OS and contribute

 22:52:29 <Xai> Xai: is from trini

 22:52:37 <trinikrono> thanks guys
