 20:22:55 <highvoltage> Welcome to this month's EMEA RMB meeting

 20:23:02 <highvoltage> and apologies for the late start

 20:23:10 <czajkowski> AlanBell: is also gonna join to help

 20:23:14 <highvoltage> applications will be called one by one. please have a short introduction ready

 20:23:20 <AlanBell> hi all

 20:23:32 <highvoltage> This month's applications are: utlemming, cielak and mhmodIbrhm

 20:23:37 <highvoltage> cielak: ready? :)

 20:23:42 <cielak> yes!

 20:23:51 <highvoltage> #topic cielak

 20:23:59 <highvoltage> cielak: please introduce yourself

 20:24:17 <cielak> so, my name is Rafał Cieślak, and have been a full-time Ubuntu user since 4.5 years

 20:24:34 <cielak> and since then I've always wanted to contribute to Ubuntu & the community

 20:24:36 <czajkowski> cielak: hi thanks for coming

 20:24:43 <cielak> :-)

 20:24:54 <highvoltage> for some reason I thought you were an Ubuntu member already :)

 20:25:00 <cielak> I particularly enjoy providing user support at AskUbuntu

 20:25:11 <cielak> during 2 years I have gathered 3,000+ rep points

 20:25:33 <cielak> I also contribute code to Ubuntu

 20:25:42 <cielak> so I did to fix few bugs in Unity

 20:25:51 <highvoltage> cielak: if you could change any one thing in the ubuntu community, what would that be?

 20:25:53 <cielak> and now I ma heavily involved in Ubuntu Accomplishment System

 20:25:53 <czajkowski> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RafalCieslak

 20:26:03 <cielak> by programming & documantation

 20:26:16 <cielak> well, I guess there is one thing that needs being improved

 20:26:19 <highvoltage> (oosh, I was lookng at the wrong wiki page)

 20:26:45 <cielak> it's introducing new developers - programmers - who might be helpful in many Ubuntu related projects

 20:26:54 <highvoltage> cielak: if you could change any one thing in the Ubuntu community, what would that be?

 20:27:00 <cielak> in my opinion we do not encourage them enough

 20:27:24 <cielak> and I have met with situation that some of them were convinced that it's a hard thing

 20:27:33 <cielak> so that's what needs fixing IMO

 20:27:34 <cielak> also

 20:27:39 <cielak> there is Polish LoCo

 20:27:55 <cielak> which I guess is a great example of what a LoCo should not be

 20:28:59 <czajkowski> cielak: why is that ?

 20:29:06 <cielak> there is quite a broad community, but it all ends with endless flamewars, which brings Ubuntu bad reputation, here in Poland

 20:29:36 <cielak> the "official" polish ubuntu sites & forum are badly maintained, and are incredibly unhelpful

 20:29:51 <lifeless> got to run, baby to put down for naptime

 20:30:22 <lifeless> czajkowski: you're not in -rmb

 20:30:22 <czajkowski> highvoltage: I've no more questions

 20:30:30 <highvoltage> ok lets vote

 20:30:35 <cielak> fixing that will of course require lots of efforts and I won't be able to fix it on my own

 20:31:55 <cielak> thanks! :)

 20:31:56 <highvoltage> yes

 20:31:59 <SpamapS> I want to say he's awesome and must go soon

 20:32:02 <highvoltage> sorry, I messed up the order a bit

 20:32:14 <highvoltage> SpamapS: acknowledged :)

 20:32:26 <highvoltage> utlemming: your turn! please tell us a bit about yourself

 20:32:30 <utlemming> Hi, my name is Ben Howard (utlemming). I am currently am the currator of the Ubuntu Cloud Images. I'm a technical, albeit, non-packaging person. My contributions to Ubuntu involve setting up new Cloud image infrastructure, building new cloud deployment metholodogies, and maintaining the images at http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com. I am a Canonical employee. I am applying for membership here instead of through the developer board since I don't really

 20:32:31 <utlemming> do much packaging work.

 20:32:39 <czajkowski> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ben_Howard%28utlemming%29

 20:33:01 <AlanBell> that is a lot of code :) https://code.launchpad.net/~utlemming

 20:33:09 <utlemming> Yes it is :)

 20:33:40 <highvoltage> utlemming: could you tell us a little about what building new cloud images entails? do you plan to involve the community at all with that, and is it even possible?

 20:33:52 <utlemming> Yes, it is very possiable.

 20:34:14 <utlemming> One of the things that I am working on right now is to enable the community to be able to take our base image and then change it

 20:34:46 <utlemming> Also, I'm holding a UDS session where I am trying to get more input from the users

 20:34:55 <highvoltage> great :)

 20:35:06 <highvoltage> any other questions, comments or cheers?

 20:35:31 <SpamapS> utlemming is extremely knowledgable

 20:35:37 <SpamapS> and helpful to users in #ubuntu-cloud and #ubuntu-server

 20:35:54 <SpamapS> He will do a great honor to the @ubuntu.com email domian. :)

 20:35:58 <czajkowski> utlemming: how would you like to help the community more?

 20:35:59 <highvoltage> :)

 20:36:01 <czajkowski> and get them more involved?

 20:36:23 <utlemming> 1) gather input and find out where the images need work or are not meeting people's needs

 20:36:40 <utlemming> to this point, I have several meetings set up with communitity users next week to talk about it

 20:37:29 <highvoltage> great, I'm sure you have more ideas, but it's time to put it to vote

 20:37:31 <utlemming> 2) being active on the relevant email lists -- which is helping to generate disucssion. I've learned that by interacting with the community that I can get important feedback, and more imporantly help the community use the images
