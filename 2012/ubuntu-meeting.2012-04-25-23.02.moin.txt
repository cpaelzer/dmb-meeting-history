 23:02:13 <bodhi_zazen> OK, anyone want to drive ?

 23:02:31 <Iowan> I

 23:02:35 <s-fox> [TOPIC] FC meeting

 23:02:51 <bodhi_zazen> [link]https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ForumCouncilAgenda

 23:03:23 <bodhi_zazen> I would like to make a few opening comments if I may ,promise they will be short =)

 23:03:32 <s-fox> Okay bodhi_zazen, go

 23:03:37 <bodhi_zazen> First, thank you all for coming

 23:03:51 <bodhi_zazen> we are trying to get input from across the community

 23:04:15 <bodhi_zazen> during the month, please use FH&F , #ubuntuforums, etc to discuss issues with staff / FC

 23:04:44 <bodhi_zazen> these meeting are (hopefully) for decisions, with minimal discussion, discussion should have already taken place

 23:05:00 <bodhi_zazen> /end

 23:05:21 <s-fox> Well said and very good point made.

 23:05:46 <s-fox> Okay, first item on the agenda...

 23:06:02 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Archiving forums

 23:06:14 * bodhi_zazen hides

 23:06:22 <bodhi_zazen> I think we forgot to discuss this topic

 23:06:31 <s-fox> I know ;)

 23:06:39 <jacob> are this and the second topic the same?

 23:06:42 <bodhi_zazen> We should make a proposal to the community, set some guidelines

 23:06:51 <bodhi_zazen> no jacob

 23:06:55 <s-fox> But the idea to archive out of date information is solid.

 23:07:20 <s-fox> I agree on getting input from the wider community, just like we did for the tutorials

 23:07:27 <bodhi_zazen> I suggest we make a concerted effort to discuss the topic over the next month

 23:07:54 <s-fox> That sounds reasonable to me.

 23:08:20 <s-fox> [VOTE] Make concerted effort to discuss archiving out of date information with wider community

 23:08:58 <meetingology> Votes for:6 Votes against:0 Abstentions:0

 23:08:58 <meetingology> Motion carried

 23:09:14 <s-fox> Bad jacob

 23:09:16 <s-fox> ;)

 23:09:18 <jacob> :D

 23:09:29 <s-fox> Okay, next item

 23:09:49 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Close tutorial and tips and move to wiki

 23:09:52 <bodhi_zazen> IMO closing T& T has gone fantastic

 23:10:02 <s-fox> This appears to have started and the ball is rolling

 23:10:04 <bodhi_zazen> I think there have been some (appropriate) concerns

 23:10:08 <bodhi_zazen> but ...

 23:10:26 <bodhi_zazen> we have connected people from forums to wiki and have interest from askubuntu

 23:10:29 <s-fox> What are the main concerns ?

 23:10:35 <bodhi_zazen> pixie has done outstanding work

 23:10:46 <bodhi_zazen> people do not like change ;)

 23:10:49 <s-fox> forestpiskie has been amazing

 23:11:00 <bodhi_zazen> we need to encourage these efforts, and more important

 23:11:09 <bodhi_zazen> engage the community to use and contribute to the wiki

 23:11:12 <jacob> I think the only real concern was the migration of tutorials, which seems to be going along smoothly

 23:11:29 <s-fox> I seem to recall some sort of script helping with the markup

 23:11:48 <bodhi_zazen> There was the concern if we closed the T&T, no one would contribute to wiki, and we would loose a valuable community asset

 23:12:12 <bodhi_zazen> but, honestly, group effort on documentation is easier and it did not take long for the advantages to become obvious

 23:12:24 <bodhi_zazen> I encourage all staff to encourage wiki as much as possible

 23:12:29 <jacob> I think the problem was the wiki was not very well advertised on the forums. if a link for T&T is made to the forums somehow, i think it'll be less of an issue.

 23:12:45 <s-fox> By the looks of things it has evolved, and T&T section has been used for supporting specific wiki pages

 23:12:46 <jacob> s/forums/wiki/

 23:12:51 <bodhi_zazen> If people complain the page is out of date -> help encourage the community to maintain

 23:12:59 <bodhi_zazen> +1 Jac

 23:13:25 <bodhi_zazen> that is the plan s-fox , wiki is for documentation , T&T is to discuss documentation

 23:13:34 <cariboo907> there is an editor for editing wiki pages in the repositories called editmoin

 23:13:37 <bodhi_zazen> should we add foo or bar to rootsudo ?

 23:13:40 <s-fox> Okay, I am not really sure anything to vote on here. But well done to all and lets continue to ease the transtition

 23:13:42 <bodhi_zazen> discussion -> change

 23:14:05 <bodhi_zazen> no vote needed, just an update

 23:14:13 <bodhi_zazen> and ask staff to promote the effort

 23:14:33 <s-fox> [ACTION] Staff to promote wiki effort

 23:14:33 * meetingology Staff to promote wiki effort

 23:14:37 <s-fox> :)

 23:14:45 <bodhi_zazen> If we get 10 people to edit 1 wiki page / month -> wiki will improve

 23:15:04 <bodhi_zazen> Needs to be a sustained effort, not a burn out fast effort

 23:15:12 <s-fox> Yes agreed

 23:15:19 <s-fox> Lets move on

 23:15:27 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Add new staff

 23:15:39 <bodhi_zazen> OK, I'll say it

 23:15:47 <bodhi_zazen> I think we should add 2-4 staff

 23:16:13 <bodhi_zazen> I would like to try some sort of volunteer -> short list -> vote

 23:16:22 <s-fox> I think we are coping, but we could do we a few more staffers. With a focus on asia / oz timezones

 23:16:50 <bodhi_zazen> coping, yes, but too closed, IMO

 23:16:59 <cariboo907> even western north america, as at times I'm the only there

 23:16:59 <s-fox> Anyone got any comments ?

 23:17:02 <bodhi_zazen> we need to engage the community, not just "cope"

 23:17:17 <Iowan> How much is need, versus rewarding active participants?

 23:17:27 <oldos2er> bodhi_zazen: can you explain "too closed"?

 23:17:44 <cariboo907> I really don't like the idea of volunteers

 23:18:02 <bodhi_zazen> The staff is viewed as too closed, a select group selected by favoritism or cronyism

 23:18:18 <oldos2er> bodhi_zazen: thank you

 23:18:21 <bodhi_zazen> people come and go, staff fall inactive, we need to train the next group

 23:18:22 <jacob> i'm not sure about volunteers either, but it might be worth a try. an experiment.

 23:18:38 <coffeecat> Volunteering was discussed in SCC. There were several objections.

 23:18:58 <bodhi_zazen> Post criteria -> ask UFM to volunteer or nominate other UFM -> review candiates -> UFM vote

 23:19:40 <bodhi_zazen> I think the major objection was that volunteers would not be reviewed

 23:19:41 <s-fox> OMG - The entire forum council is here

 23:19:43 <jacob> was the criteria of requiring an active ubuntu membership to be one of them?

 23:19:45 <s-fox> Hey overdrank

 23:19:46 <cariboo907> I could see UFM's nominate members for staff positions

 23:19:58 <s-fox> oh wait, no ai

 23:19:59 <overdrank> Hello all

 23:20:02 <bodhi_zazen> nomination works for me

 23:20:17 <bodhi_zazen> We need to "test the waters"

 23:20:27 <cariboo907> +1 to that

 23:20:38 <bodhi_zazen> If we want to continue with the current staff selection, that is fine

 23:20:44 <s-fox> Okay, well we are only looking to add a couple new staff so it is a  good test to iron out the process

 23:20:55 <bodhi_zazen> We need to be able to say , we tried .... and had ... problem ;)

 23:21:02 <bodhi_zazen> Or , perhaps it will be better

 23:21:03 <jacob> it's worth a shot if nothing else

 23:21:07 <s-fox> [VOTE] Get UFM to nominate other UFM for staff poitions

 23:21:07 <meetingology> Please vote on: Get UFM to nominate other UFM for staff poitions

 23:22:01 <bodhi_zazen> I am suggesting we need to encourage the Ubuntu forums community to participate and contribute beyond the forums

 23:22:15 <s-fox> Silly tablet scroll issue  >.<

 23:22:21 <bodhi_zazen> Forums is the entry, identify the good, the bad, and the ugly -> get them involved =)

 23:29:54 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Community building

 23:29:56 <bodhi_zazen> community building is going very well, but will never going to be on autopilot

 23:30:03 <bodhi_zazen> As staff, you are leaders

 23:30:15 <bodhi_zazen> I encourage you to get involved, there are tons of projects

 23:30:27 <bodhi_zazen> you do not have to to them, just know they are there

 23:30:40 <bodhi_zazen> Example - xubuntu could have used some help this release ...

 23:30:45 <bodhi_zazen> U+1

 23:30:48 <bodhi_zazen> wiki efforts

 23:30:57 <bodhi_zazen> join #ubuntuforums and #ubuntu-community-team

 23:31:05 <bodhi_zazen> If you like forums, that is fine

 23:31:14 <bodhi_zazen> be active in FH&F

 23:31:34 <cariboo907> I don't know if this comes under community building, but kansasnoob has been diagnosed with dementia

 23:31:34 <bodhi_zazen> be [s]active[/s] friendly in café and community games

 23:32:16 <bodhi_zazen> If you are too busy to get active, fine, the would fall under need more staff ;)

 23:32:46 * jacob shuffles about

 23:32:47 <bodhi_zazen> Just be aware , we are reaching critical mass where we really can integrate with, and contribute to the Ubuntu community

 23:32:56 <s-fox> Starting  this month I am going to be writing a monthly news update kind of thing for the wider community to view on planet ubuntu

 23:33:24 <jacob> but agreed, and I know I sound hypocritical, but being active on staff is what helps keep a community going

 23:33:28 <bodhi_zazen> http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendars/fridge/

 23:34:27 <bodhi_zazen> You do not need a google account to view the fridge calander

 23:34:27 <s-fox> bodhi_zazen ?

 23:34:42 <s-fox> Oh I see, never mind

 23:34:49 <bodhi_zazen> fridge calendar = major community discussions / meetings

 23:34:56 * s-fox nods

 23:35:29 <bodhi_zazen> Otherwise, see my update to the staff in scc

 23:35:56 <bodhi_zazen> Staff only : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1953124

 23:35:58 <s-fox> Oh, incase you missed it I added links to the forum irc channel in the quicklinks bar in the site menu

 23:36:38 <bodhi_zazen> I know, IRC is new, even frightening at first, but, after a while you will be in 10 channels

 23:36:53 <overdrank> lol

 23:36:54 <bodhi_zazen> http://wordofgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/I-love-when-a-plan-comes-together.gif

 23:37:12 <jacob> and idle in 9 ;)

 23:37:18 <cariboo907> I can manage 5 :)

 23:37:20 <bodhi_zazen> Don't worry, everyone is like that

 23:37:26 <bodhi_zazen> if you need help ask

 23:37:36 <s-fox> Really? :)

 23:37:43 <bodhi_zazen> If you irc via issri in screen 24/7 - seek a therapist

 23:37:53 <oldos2er> lol

 23:37:53 <bodhi_zazen> irssi , lol

 23:38:02 <Iowan> (via IRS?)

 23:38:03 <s-fox> No

 23:38:05 <jacob> bodhi_zazen: hah. i don't need a therapist, i use weechat.

 23:38:05 <s-fox> :)

 23:38:12 <Iowan> (IRC)

 23:38:18 <s-fox> I would like to move on....

 23:38:19 <oldos2er> bodhi_zazen: i resemble that remark  :)

 23:39:39 <bodhi_zazen> Team reports are greatly appreciated by the community, and the look nice

 23:39:52 <bodhi_zazen> Only thing is, make sure they get on the community monthly report

 23:39:52 <Iowan> What did I mess up last month? ;)

 23:39:58 <s-fox> Well done to everyone for getting them back on track

 23:40:21 <s-fox> Few minor issues with the ones that had been done

 23:40:23 <bodhi_zazen> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TeamReports/April2012

 23:40:40 <s-fox> 1 - Missing items that were discussed in the meetings

 23:40:43 <bodhi_zazen> We should be on the community team report automatically

 23:41:04 <bodhi_zazen> We are right under the Community Council

 23:41:05 <s-fox> 2 - Naming convention is very important, other pages link to CURRENT MONTH

 23:41:18 <s-fox> ^ bodhi_zazen

 23:41:29 <Iowan> :( Thought I verified that it was there...

 23:41:55 <bodhi_zazen> It's OK Iowan , this is why I am trying to get FC members up to speed =)

 23:42:07 <bodhi_zazen> Needs to be there by end of month

 23:42:14 <Iowan> my tranny keeps slipping...

 23:42:23 <s-fox> Iowan Don't be sad, something had to be said or nothing is learned =)

 23:42:51 <bodhi_zazen> I never can recall the syntax, so, add comments to the templates on what to do

 23:43:00 <bodhi_zazen> Comments start with two ##

 23:43:29 <bodhi_zazen> Who is willing to try the monthly report this month ?

 23:43:39 <bodhi_zazen> Heck, two of you could learn together

 23:43:43 <s-fox> bodhi_zazen i am going to do division of labour at the end

 23:43:46 * cariboo907 will

 23:43:55 <bodhi_zazen> OK, sorry s-fox

 23:44:09 <s-fox> np

 23:44:10 <bodhi_zazen> next topic ?

 23:44:15 <s-fox> yep

 23:44:38 <bodhi_zazen> Leave the agenda in place, agenda items = bullet points for team report

 23:44:40 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Firefox / Ubiquity forum links

 23:45:00 <s-fox> I have an update on ubiquity side of things

 23:45:07 <bodhi_zazen> This one is short, if you want them fixed, file a bug report on LP with code

 23:45:26 <bodhi_zazen> we missed 12.04, but if we submit decent code it will be considered for 12.10

 23:45:49 <bodhi_zazen> then accept the decision of the community who reviews the request

 23:45:54 <bodhi_zazen> No more WWIII

 23:45:58 <bodhi_zazen> =)

 23:46:11 <s-fox> From what I gather the slide was rewritten and askubuntu was removed. That wasn't what we were after.  I have written a html slide and sent code to bodsda. i need to poke him again

 23:46:24 <bodhi_zazen> \o/

 23:46:39 <bodhi_zazen> You have about 3 months s-fox

 23:47:14 <s-fox> philinux was pushing the firefox bookmarks, and has posted a revised bookmark file

 23:47:46 <s-fox> I recall he was having issues getting the maintainers to look at the revised file, which is a bit sad.

 23:47:56 <bodhi_zazen> Aye, but after the 12.04 deadline, otherwise bookmarks looked good

 23:48:07 <uRock> Having UF in the bookmarks would be great

 23:48:12 <bodhi_zazen> Probably need to submit for 12.10

 23:48:37 <bodhi_zazen> we were late, and to be honest, they have better things to do with the impending release of 12.04

 23:48:43 <bodhi_zazen> target 12.10 release

 23:48:46 <s-fox> Okay, that is me done on updates.  Perhaps we should ask philinux for an update

 23:48:56 <bodhi_zazen> PM ?

 23:49:05 <s-fox> Yep :)

 23:49:22 <bodhi_zazen> Any other comments ?

 23:49:26 <cariboo907> isn't he still off  fishing in Scotland?

 23:49:58 <s-fox> Oh yes, that is right

 23:50:38 <s-fox> [ACTION] PM philinux for firefox update

 23:50:38 * meetingology PM philinux for firefox update

 23:50:53 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Staff selection process

 23:51:02 <bodhi_zazen> We discussed staff selection, entire staff feels candidates need to be reviewed, and when we have a short list of UFM -> UFM vote , honestly current staff is the largest single voting block, so it is not the compete loss of control we might fear

 23:51:10 <s-fox> I think we covered this earlier with adding new staff

 23:51:22 <bodhi_zazen> I have no further comment

 23:51:26 <s-fox> Next topic?

 23:51:40 <bodhi_zazen> It has been extensively discussed b4 now

 23:51:45 <bodhi_zazen> action on this one s-fox

 23:51:48 <bodhi_zazen> vote ?

 23:51:58 <s-fox> We already voted on it

 23:52:11 <bodhi_zazen> OK with me , any objections ?

 23:52:12 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Forums team

 23:52:30 <bodhi_zazen> This one is not my topic (surprise)

 23:52:40 <s-fox> lol

 23:52:56 <bodhi_zazen> Anyone want to summarize this ?

 23:53:13 <bodhi_zazen> I think we should kill off the teams and use #ubuntuforums

 23:53:21 <jacob> I think we should nuke the entire collection of forums teams, honestly. Even if it means re-making some that are desired to keep.

 23:53:34 <bodhi_zazen> If enough people want to start some project, have them make a proposal

 23:53:37 <jacob> aye

 23:53:46 <jacob> other than that, my thoughts are in the thread

 23:53:52 <Iowan> probably the cleanest way

 23:53:59 <s-fox> Spring cleaning on old teams

 23:54:05 <jacob> i don't believe any of the six have seen any activity

 23:54:15 <s-fox> Anyone got anything to add before the vote?

 23:54:23 <jacob> also the forums attached to some of those

 23:54:24 <bodhi_zazen> Only one is "active", and I use the term loosly

 23:54:34 <Iowan> which one BT?

 23:54:34 <jacob> T&T has a T&TT forum that is dead

 23:54:38 <bodhi_zazen> yea

 23:54:38 <s-fox> The BT bodhi_zazend ?

 23:54:57 <jacob> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=348 & subforum it seems

 23:54:58 <bodhi_zazen> zmg, it's alive

 23:55:07 <s-fox> Okay, vote time

 23:55:08 <bodhi_zazen> I asked duanedesign to lead the BT

 23:57:28 <Iowan> Do we need to post a "warning" that they are going?

 23:57:29 <s-fox> I think it would be polite to email the team leader if we close the subforums

 23:57:29 <overdrank> \~/

 23:57:44 <jacob> Iowan: i doubt anyone would notice without one for quite some time. :P

 23:57:58 <s-fox> Direct email bodhi_zazen

 23:58:25 <overdrank> My apologies but I have to excuse myself

 23:58:26 <bodhi_zazen> I'm sorry , that email has been disconnected ...

 23:58:27 <jacob> well scraatch that

 23:58:33 <s-fox> See you overdrank

 23:58:38 <bodhi_zazen> thanks overd

 23:58:40 <s-fox> thanks for coming

 23:59:03 <s-fox> bodhi_zazen we should at least try

 23:59:04 <bodhi_zazen> next topic, coming up on the 60 minute mark

 23:59:07 <s-fox> bounce or not

 23:59:11 <bodhi_zazen> OK s-fox

 23:59:34 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Fix a meeting time

 23:59:48 <s-fox> I think the only issue with this time is AI :/

 23:59:49 <bodhi_zazen> This time seems to work, 3rd Wed of the month ?

 00:00:12 <cariboo907> works for me :)

 00:00:18 <s-fox> Works for me

 00:00:19 <Iowan> Good here...

 00:00:28 <uRock> +1

 00:00:45 <Iowan> Time= now +/- 3 hours

 00:01:10 <s-fox> Again, my worry is for AI

 00:01:26 <coffeecat> Agreed - this will always be bad for AI

 00:01:37 <jacob> Why not cycle times every meeting? you'll get a different selection of FC every time

 00:02:06 <bodhi_zazen> because, no time that is good for AI works for anyone else

 00:02:20 <jacob> that's... tricky.

 00:02:45 <s-fox> I think we should discuss this further, perhaps vote later

 00:02:58 <bodhi_zazen> so when we look at avability, say there are 4,5,or 6 members available as time foo and bar and another_time

 00:03:05 <bodhi_zazen> It is always AI missing

 00:03:28 <bodhi_zazen> and when you look at AI times, only 1 or 2 members at most are available

 00:03:44 <bodhi_zazen> so , no matter what, we are going to need to learn to communicate outside of FC meetings

 00:03:48 <s-fox> It is difficult

 00:03:59 <s-fox> +1 to communication

 00:04:19 <s-fox> Okay, next topic

 00:04:34 <s-fox> [TOPIC] New UFM

 00:05:04 <s-fox> Only one this month, and he is already an ubuntu member....

 00:05:30 <s-fox> which i still don't understand the point but anyway

 00:05:30 <bodhi_zazen> Is there anyone who does not know cprofitt ?

 00:05:34 <Iowan> I'm confused - do I also need to re-apply via forums?

 00:05:50 <bodhi_zazen> Iowan: because we have 2 categories

 00:06:03 <jacob> Iowan: I think he just want to have a more formal forum membership.

 00:06:05 <bodhi_zazen> Ubuntu members -> they all get the little user benefits

 00:06:10 <bodhi_zazen> and Ubuntu Forums Members

 00:06:40 <bodhi_zazen> Only Ubuntu members active on the forums (UFM) are eligible for staff and to vote

 00:07:04 <s-fox> Does this mean I need to reapply?

 00:07:13 <bodhi_zazen> so, if they go or have gone through an alternate membership board, they need to apply for UFM

 00:07:17 <s-fox> I did not get my membership for forums activites

 00:07:18 <bodhi_zazen> I would say so s-fox

 00:07:27 <Iowan> ditto

 00:07:38 <cariboo907> Does cprofitt just want to become a UFM so that he is eligible to become a staff member

 00:07:42 <bodhi_zazen> That is the best way to identify UM active on the fourms

 00:07:54 <bodhi_zazen> no cariboo907 , he wants to  vote for staff

 00:08:38 <bodhi_zazen> I do not think it is the general policy of Ubuntu Team, nor do I think we want, all UM to vote for ubuntu forums elections

 00:08:51 <s-fox> Okay, that I understand

 00:09:02 <bodhi_zazen> As an ubuntu member, if you are not active on IRC, you do not get asked to vote for ubuntu irc board

 00:09:07 <bodhi_zazen> etc

 00:09:20 <bodhi_zazen> I anticipate a small # of these applications

 00:10:58 <s-fox> mhall119 ping ?

 00:11:06 <pleia2> good to see another CC member getting more involved with forums (we miss technoviking!)

 00:11:29 <bodhi_zazen> 'lo pleia2

 00:11:55 <pleia2> sorry, don't mean to interrupt meeting :)

 00:12:19 <bodhi_zazen> no bother, glad to have you

 00:12:31 <s-fox> mhall119 added an item to the agenda wanting to add a programming related forum to the main page rather than under the programming section.  i am not sure on the reasoning and generally think it is unorganised if we do that

 00:12:34 <mhall119> s-fox: here

 00:12:42 <s-fox> Hey mhall119 :)

 00:12:46 <mhall119> mostly

 00:13:00 <bodhi_zazen> I say, add the forum, we can remove it if it is unused

 00:13:10 <s-fox> [TOPIC] Add top level suport forum for ubuntu app developers

 00:13:42 <s-fox> mhall119 can you explain your idea please?

 00:14:02 <mhall119> so one of our big goals in the 12.10 cycle is to build a community of independent application developers

 00:14:32 <mhall119> and one thing that almost every other developer.*.* website offers app devs is a forum

 00:14:38 <bodhi_zazen> mhall119: can this be a subsection of the ubuntu+1 forums ?

 00:14:43 <duanedesign> o/

 00:14:45 <mhall119> not just for technical/programming support either

 00:14:59 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: no, it'll be a permanent fixture

 00:15:11 <bodhi_zazen> duanedesign: if it on topic, speak, otherwise wait for open floor

 00:15:24 <mhall119> so questions and support will range from programming to packaging, pricing, promotion, collaboration, etc

 00:15:24 <bodhi_zazen> Where would you propose we add it ?

 00:15:41 <bodhi_zazen> http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php

 00:15:52 <bodhi_zazen> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=310

 00:15:59 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: I was hoping to get it in the "Main Support Categories" area

 00:16:08 <mhall119> as top-level as possible

 00:17:18 <mhall119> we'll link to it from developer.ubuntu.com/community

 00:17:25 <bodhi_zazen> I have someone who wants to learn to package the linux-libre kernel into a ppa (they make .deb now, but want to learn better)

 00:17:32 <mhall119> as one of the official places for app developers to get support and meet other app developers

 00:17:37 <bodhi_zazen> would they use the forums for that sort of activity ?

 00:17:43 <bodhi_zazen> learning to package ?

 00:17:43 <jacob> I think it sounds like a reasonable idea; it could attract a healthy developer community, and is no worse than any of the partner forums under main support ;)

 00:17:51 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: no, that's ubuntu development, not app development

 00:18:10 <mhall119> we're targeting people who make, say, Angry Birds, and wants to make a native Ubuntu version

 00:18:35 <bodhi_zazen> but programming side ?

 00:18:35 <mhall119> they don't care about kernels or debian packaging with lint --pedantic or all that

 00:18:36 <s-fox> mhall119 we get people building applications in that section

 00:18:41 <bodhi_zazen> what about packaging ?

 00:18:45 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: programming will be part of it, but not all of it

 00:18:50 <bodhi_zazen> packaging is a frequent FAQ

 00:18:59 <s-fox> +1 bodhi_zazen

 00:19:01 <mhall119> it'll also be pricing, promotion, etc

 00:19:18 <jacob> makes sense to me, considering the "app" model ubuntu is moving towards. consolidating things might be useful.

 00:19:28 <jacob> (as much as i despise the word "app")

 00:20:02 <s-fox> Iowan cariboo907 coffeecat thoughts?

 00:20:21 <Iowan> Thinking...

 00:20:37 <mhall119> I don't really want to send them all over the forums, I'd rather give them one place specifically for them

 00:20:38 <cariboo907> I think it's a good idea

 00:21:02 <bodhi_zazen> +1 mhall119

 00:21:02 <jacob> echo that

 00:21:09 <mhall119> just like they expect from other developer portals

 00:21:35 <Iowan> Probably worth a try - as mentioned about partner subforums

 00:21:53 <Effenberg0x0> o/

 00:22:06 <bodhi_zazen> If it is on topic Effenberg0x0 speak up

 00:22:07 <s-fox> Effenberg0x0 go :)

 00:22:12 <Effenberg0x0> Apps need testers. I see a good opportunity for integration there

 00:22:38 <mhall119> oh, for added clarification, this will be mainly targetting people who will be submitting apps through MyApps and the ARB, not to Universe

 00:22:41 <jacob> this almost seems to merit an additional section, even. but a single forum would be good to start with.

 00:23:29 <bodhi_zazen> My 2c are to make this work as best we can

 00:23:43 <coffeecat> I like Effenberg0x0's point.

 00:24:14 <Effenberg0x0> QA won't test 3rd parts. Ubuntu+1/U+1 Team can help. Good opportunity for knowledge exchange.

 00:24:22 <bodhi_zazen> mhall119: can you or someone help develop the description you envision ?

 00:24:27 <bodhi_zazen> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=326

 00:24:32 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: sure, dpm and I can do that

 00:24:35 <bodhi_zazen> "The perfect place to post for your Ubuntu support if you are new to Linux."

 00:24:51 <bodhi_zazen> We can put it under main for visibility

 00:25:05 <s-fox> Okay, lets vote.

 00:25:07 <Iowan> Horse before cart: Loco forum mods?

 00:25:10 <bodhi_zazen> as it evolved , see if it belongs there or if it should be moved to a development section

 00:25:34 <bodhi_zazen> mhall119: yes, any help with moderating this section ?

 00:25:58 <mhall119> bodhi_zazen: I'd be happy to, dpm will too I'm sure, and we can get he ARB to help too

 00:26:03 <bodhi_zazen> These sorts of discussions can get , err, interesting

 00:29:43 <Iowan> Pricing always raises a red flag...

 00:29:48 <mhall119> coffeecat: yeah, I didn't mean "promote your app on the forums", I meant "ask other app devs what they did for promotion, what work and what didn't, etc"

 00:30:07 <bodhi_zazen> As do links to products off ubuntu web pages from members with < 10-15 posts

 00:30:14 <coffeecat> mhall119, sure. But some might get it wrong! :)

 00:30:22 <s-fox> We should make an announcement to the forum population, otherwise  we are going to get buried in reports

 00:30:37 <bodhi_zazen> Part of setting up the forums

 00:30:39 <Iowan> sticky in neew forum

 00:30:46 <mhall119> s-fox: we will also likely announce it on the developer portal blog

 00:30:58 <bodhi_zazen> develop description, post guidelines as a sticky

 00:31:12 <s-fox> mhall119 a lot of the forum users are not devs =)

 00:31:33 <mhall119> s-fox: right, I was just mentioning it

 00:31:48 <bodhi_zazen> Yea, we chased the dev out with pitchforks and torches =)

 00:33:58 <mhall119> thanks again, I'll get with dpm tomorrow to write up that description and some guidelines from our side, then you guys can add whatever guidelines you think will be needed

 00:34:01 <s-fox> moergaes added this  item

 00:34:06 <moergaes> Yes

 00:34:11 <s-fox> moergaes you have the floor =)

 00:34:16 <moergaes> Thanks.

 00:34:19 <moergaes> We have talked somewhat about this in the staff forum

 00:34:25 <moergaes> but I would like to hear if we have an agreement / decision.

 00:34:34 <moergaes> Ubuntu+1 is different from all other fora

 00:34:41 <moergaes> as the purpose is not support, but software development

 00:34:50 <moergaes> (particularly testing and bug reporting).

 00:35:10 <moergaes> Therefore support request should not go there IMHO.

 00:35:17 <moergaes> My suggestion:

 00:35:21 <cariboo907> I think the point is moot, as Precise comes out tomorrow, and there will be a new QQ subforum,

 00:35:39 <moergaes> This is meant for U+1 in general

 00:35:45 <moergaes> not only this cycle.

 00:35:55 <s-fox> cariboo907 please wait until moergaes is done. :)

 00:36:24 <moergaes> I suggest that all threads in U+1 should serve a purpose regarding software development

 00:36:28 <cariboo907> OK :(

 00:36:34 <moergaes> else they should be moved (or stay) somewhere else

 00:36:40 <moergaes> mostly Absolute Beginner Talk.

 00:36:46 <quackers> o/

 00:36:49 <moergaes> Comments?

 00:37:00 <Iowan> where should U+1 support go?

 00:37:18 <Effenberg0x0> o/

 00:37:18 <jacob> agreed. but when do we decide to stop moving threads *in* and start moving them *out* into general areas? 2 weeks before release? beta 2?

 00:37:40 <s-fox> go Effenberg0x0

 00:37:43 <bodhi_zazen> o/

 00:37:48 <Effenberg0x0> Mark created Development release USERS (not testers) when he did this: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/938, which was foralized here: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-plusonemaint-priorities

 00:37:48 <Effenberg0x0> Therefore, users exist, users need support. And we benefit from converting support requests into new testers.

 00:37:57 <uRock> Maybe have two sub-sections, one for devs and another for support?

 00:38:08 <jacob> i like that idea uRock

 00:38:21 <bodhi_zazen> +1 uRock

 00:38:22 <jacob> U+1 forum always seemed a bit cluttered

 00:38:33 <bodhi_zazen> u+1 have grown

 00:38:37 <cariboo907> We have very few developers in that section, they mainly answer support questions

 00:38:42 <bodhi_zazen> quackers: go

 00:38:57 <jacob> also, I also think that U+1 support/development should be moved up a little bit. it's quite hidden, and many threads moved there are made by those who didn't see it

 00:39:08 <quackers> where should testers of the current development release ask for support, if not in U + 1

 00:39:11 <quackers> ?

 00:39:11 <bodhi_zazen> could move it under general ...

 00:39:33 <quackers> isn't that thinning an already limited supply of help?

 00:39:34 <bodhi_zazen> Let me try to answer that quackers , if I may ...

 00:39:45 <s-fox> we'd be flooded with reports if they do not have their own section

 00:40:04 <bodhi_zazen> There are no absolutes, people (including staff) need to use judgement

 00:40:13 <Effenberg0x0> This release (QQ) is about quality. We need more common users testing the Development Release. I ask you to consider that cautiously in any change we do to the current structure.

 00:40:17 <bodhi_zazen> Lets say a user needs support on u+1 ...

 00:40:39 <bodhi_zazen> Is is a question that is very general - how do I install software ?

 00:40:52 <bodhi_zazen> If it is general enough , leave it in ABT or GH or wherever

 00:40:55 <quackers> not usually

 00:41:00 <bodhi_zazen> Or is it specific to U+1

 00:41:07 <bodhi_zazen> In that case, it needs to be moved

 00:41:14 <jacob> doesn't that really echo current policy? :)

 00:41:18 <quackers> often specific imo

 00:41:21 <bodhi_zazen> This last release cycle was NOT typical

 00:41:28 <bodhi_zazen> it was MUCH MUCH more stable

 00:41:38 <bodhi_zazen> wait until X fails on u+1

 00:41:42 <cariboo907> We usually make some suggestions, and help the new user along, as long as the question is concerneing the development release

 00:41:54 <bodhi_zazen> so u+1 specific support / development -> u+1

 00:42:02 <bodhi_zazen> there will always be judgement involved

 00:42:05 <cariboo907> that's my thought

 00:42:12 <quackers> for me, yes

 00:42:40 <bodhi_zazen> Does the support question pertain to development , development specific problems ?

 00:42:47 <quackers> itconcentrates users

 00:42:51 <s-fox> Okay, I see a few people in agreement on an idea. Time to vote

 00:42:53 <bodhi_zazen> Or is it general enough to remain in ABT ?

 00:43:10 <bodhi_zazen> If in doubt -> move to u+1

 00:43:13 <coffeecat> One problem is the "naive" user who has no intention of testing, install an alpha or beta without knowing what they are and needs help. It dilutes the U+1 forum.

 00:43:18 <bodhi_zazen> until a stable beta ?

 00:43:28 <moergaes> coffeecat: Exactly

 00:43:31 <bodhi_zazen> +1 coffeecat

 00:43:34 <moergaes> that was my point.

 00:44:03 <bodhi_zazen> But again, this release cycle was more stable then average

 00:44:10 <s-fox> [VOTE]  u+1 specific then move, if question is generic then leave in General / ABT

 00:50:26 <bodhi_zazen> No ban reversal candidates added themselves to the agenda, none showed up

 00:50:29 <Effenberg0x0> Thanks, I have two items for you to consider. We can discuss both in the future as we're short on time now.

 00:50:40 <Effenberg0x0> #1 (The small one): This cycle is about quality. We need more common users testing the Dev. Release. If possible, I'd like Ubuntu+1 to move up a little in the forum sections. It's a little hidden, and that is not compatible to current Ubuntu strategy.

 00:50:49 <s-fox> don't worry, we're only 55 mins over our allocation of an hour

 00:50:51 <bodhi_zazen> Effenberg0x0: np, in the future = add them to agenda ;)

 00:51:03 <Effenberg0x0> Ok bodhi_zazen

 00:51:07 <Effenberg0x0> And #2

 00:52:44 <meetingology> Motion carried

 00:53:04 <Effenberg0x0> #2 (The big one): UF � U+1Team partnership. The U+1 Team is independent from QA and any other structure, reporting only to CC. But it is strongly related to UF (and UF's Ubuntu+1 sub-forum). Initially, most of our members came from UF, including some UF staff and Ubuntu members via Forums. We even have 2 UF Council members in our team. I personally see UF as the most successful endeavor of Ubuntu in on-line communities.

 00:53:04 <Effenberg0x0> We need to work together. U+1 team was designed to work via partnerships, with defined term lengths, goals, tasks, limited scope, metrics. In this sense, I'd like to propose such a partnership between U+1 and UF.

 00:53:04 <Effenberg0x0> UF can benefit from having some of it's staff involved in learning in testing, QA and technical work � a glimpse of a broader Ubuntu universe. UF can also recruit staff and candidates to Members from U+1 (likely technical and committed to Ubuntu).

 00:53:07 <Effenberg0x0> U+1 Team can benefit from having more Ubuntu-commited members in testing (and possibly DOC and other activities) and strong recruitment to testing via Forums. Forums are also (IMO) an amazing thermometer of Ubuntu software quality.

 00:53:13 <Effenberg0x0> We can work to draft a scope for such partnership together and define a term-length of one development cycle as a trial. I can have a draft for your appreciation in a week or so.

 00:53:34 <Effenberg0x0> whew

 00:54:04 <s-fox> +1 on reviewing a draft

 00:54:33 <s-fox> The idea really needs some discussion

 00:54:56 <bodhi_zazen> discussion would be great, plan sounds solid

 00:55:06 <bodhi_zazen> continue to build on success

 00:55:23 <Effenberg0x0> I think it's a win-win. For UF and U+1 Team. We just need to set details.

 00:55:52 <bodhi_zazen> o/

 00:55:56 <s-fox> Effenberg0x0 could you prepare the draft and  get it to a the FC?

 00:56:14 <Effenberg0x0> s-fox, sure. Gie a couple days and I'll send it to FC mail, ok?

 00:56:15 <bodhi_zazen> Effenberg0x0: and add an item to FC agenda
