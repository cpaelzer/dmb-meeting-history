 16:00:56 <skaet> .

 16:00:58 <skaet> Upcoming Dates:

 16:01:00 <skaet> ï¿½ 2012/02/02 - Beta 1

 16:01:02 <skaet> .

 16:01:04 <skaet> Now in BetaFreeze ( as well as UserInterfaceFreeze, FeatureFreeze).  Thank you to those who got their fixes in before the Freeze.  :)

 16:01:05 <arosales> Hello

 16:01:07 <skaet> .

 16:01:09 <skaet> Thank you from release team to stgraber for getting queuebot working on the unapproved queue last night - makes things much easier to keep on top of.  :)

 16:01:12 <skaet> .

 16:01:14 <skaet> CD images are oversized,  so figuring out options to cut down the size of some packages/etc. would be appreciated.

 16:01:17 <skaet> .

 16:01:19 <skaet> If time permits (ie. we end less than an hour), there will be a discussion at the end on some restructuring of this meeting,   possibly using an open forum for Q&A rather than explicit round table.   But for today again, we'll continue with round table.

 16:01:25 <skaet> ..

 16:01:28 <skaet> pitti,  still round table today.    want the discussion to happen first.

 16:01:28 <pitti> o/

 16:01:31 <skaet> before we switch

 16:01:38 <skaet> go pitti.

 16:01:55 <pitti> wrt CD size, we just got a new ffox/tbird which should save ~ 2 or 2.5 MB each

 16:02:06 <pitti> skaet: will that be a topic of its own?

 16:02:13 <pitti> if so, I'll just wait

 16:02:14 <skaet> yes

 16:02:19 <pitti> ack, ..

 16:03:04 <skaet> ok, on to round table, and then if we don't figure it out during round table,  image pruning topic at end.

 16:03:13 <skaet> [TOPIC] Hardware Certification team update - mlegris

 16:03:19 <mlegris> [link]https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000886.html

 16:03:40 <mlegris> no big updated besides checkbox changing to Qt

 16:03:53 <mlegris> any questions?

 16:04:01 <Riddell> mlegris: ooh where can I test that?

 16:04:13 <mlegris> Riddell: yes, you can now :)

 16:04:26 * skaet points Riddell to mletgis's email...

 16:04:31 <Riddell> got it :)

 16:05:12 <skaet> [Topic] QA team update -  jibel

 16:05:16 * Riddell already got nessita to fix a problem in ubuntuone Qt :)

 16:05:24 <jibel> hi

 16:05:29 <jibel> [link] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000885.html

 16:06:07 <jibel> upgrade bug 940252 is caused by a very bad probe effect of the code that capture debconf prompt

 16:06:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 940252 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "lucid -> precise main all upgrade: system upgrades but upgraded system is still lucid" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/940252

 16:06:17 <nessita> Riddell: want me to fix something else? :-D

 16:06:20 * nessita fixes

 16:06:31 <pitti> jibel: oh, curious

 16:06:58 <jibel> it is disabled for the moment and in return there a new bug with kde-runtime that fails to upgrade from lucid

 16:07:10 <jibel> bug 940396

 16:07:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 940396 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "lucid -> precise main all failed to upgrade: dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of kde-runtime" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/940396

 16:07:24 <jibel> ..

 16:07:27 <skaet> jibel,  looks like there will be some things to dig into indeed.   Thanks for flagging them now.

 16:07:50 * skaet contemplates foundation team will be busy for next couple of days...

 16:07:58 <Riddell> jibel: hmm interesting.  I did my smoke test on oneiric upgrade and that was fine, guess I'll need to do lucid now

 16:08:53 <skaet> Thanks jibel (and mlegris).  :)

 16:09:27 <skaet> [Topic] Security team update - mdeslaur

 16:09:34 <mdeslaur> [LINK] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000872.html

 16:09:45 <mdeslaur> apparmor upload is imminent

 16:09:59 <mdeslaur> nothing further

 16:10:01 <mdeslaur> any questions?

 16:10:06 <mdeslaur> ..

 16:10:14 <skaet> thanks mdeslaur.

 16:11:08 <skaet> apw,    will next kernel after beta 1 have the upstream commit security requests?

 16:11:29 * apw doesn't know off the top of his head, will look

 16:11:41 <skaet> thanks

 16:11:51 <skaet> [Topic] Kernel team update -apw

 16:12:07 <apw> [LINK] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000874.html

 16:12:10 <apw> 

 16:12:12 <apw> There has been a new development in the RC6 patch we applied.  An

 16:12:14 <apw> additional fix has been proposed from upstream which has been confirmed to

 16:12:16 <apw> resolve the graphics corruption issues seen on some Samsung model's when

 16:12:18 <apw> RC6 is enabled by default.  We're still waiting on feedback if it also

 16:12:20 <apw> resolves the hard shutdown issues seen on ASUS UX31E's.  We do consider

 16:12:22 <apw> these critical issues to fix before release and believe it does warrant a

 16:12:24 <apw> Beta Freeze exception.  This change is key to our RC6 testing as we are

 16:12:26 <apw> unable to request the valid upstream combinations without it.  As such,

 16:12:28 <apw> we have requested and received approval from the release team to upload.

 16:12:30 <apw> The upload was done about 10 minutes ago, we will be monitoring.

 16:12:32 <apw> 

 16:12:34 <apw> ..

 16:12:36 <apw> skaet, on the apparmor patches, i don't think we have them yet so depend when they drop ..

 16:12:54 <ScottK> Kernel is accepted and building now.

 16:13:00 <skaet> Thanks apw.

 16:13:18 <arosales> apw:  Is the RC6 bug, 937378?

 16:13:56 <arosales> looks to be so

 16:14:10 <apw> that looks to be the regression yes ...

 16:14:28 <apw> still waiting on testing there by the looks of it ..

 16:14:58 <arosales> apw, it looks like the other one mentioned on the wiki is 935965. Any other feeback? Testers reporting good power savings? Seems like it would be pretty advantageous, thanks for adding it :-)

 16:15:36 <apw> yes those who it works for are seeing 10's of percent improvement

 16:15:59 <arosales> good to hear, makes my battery happy :-)

 16:16:07 <skaet> [TOPIC] Foundations team Q&A - stgraber

 16:16:10 * stgraber waves

 16:16:11 <Riddell> I accepted the linux uploaded a little while ago

 16:16:15 <stgraber> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000878.html

 16:16:41 <stgraber> questions?

 16:17:15 <Riddell> stgraber: nothing else for beta?

 16:17:19 <stgraber> (I added a few comments to bug 926859 trying to explain why using compiz with llvmpipe by default is a bad idea)

 16:17:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 926859 in unity "llvmpipe software rendering needs blacklisting in unity-support-test" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/926859

 16:17:26 <stgraber> Riddell: installer fixes ;)

 16:17:47 <ScottK> Will the updated kernel also need a DI upload?

 16:17:49 <stgraber> but besides that, no, I think we're pretty much done with features now that whoopsie is in

 16:18:10 <stgraber> ScottK: AFAICS there wasn't an ABI bump, so no, unless we care about the RC6 fix in the netinstall images

 16:18:34 * ScottK guesses we don't.

 16:19:17 <skaet> Riddell,  yeah see jibel's QA email...  :)

 16:19:18 <stgraber> I assumed that too, so there shouldn't be a d-i rebuilt for beta-1 (I refreshed it yesterday already)

 16:19:44 <stgraber> unless something else breaks obviously...

 16:19:45 <skaet> thanks stgraber good to know.

 16:19:46 <stgraber> ..

 16:20:09 <Riddell> a bug free ubiquity is nice for a beta

 16:20:35 <skaet> dbarth,  can you comment on the compiz issues in your section...

 16:20:37 <stgraber> Riddell: not sure I can promise that ;)

 16:20:52 * skaet figures he wants to look up the details ;)

 16:21:23 <stgraber> but all beta1 targeted installer bugs should be fixed early next week and probably a bunch more

 16:21:24 <skaet> Thanks stgraber for getting the queuebot working on the unapproved queue.   MUCH APPRECIATED!.  :)

 16:21:26 <stgraber> ..

 16:21:58 <stgraber> skaet: np, was surprisingly easy to rewrite ;) I think I spent more time trying to find the existing code than rewriting it from scratch ;)

 16:22:25 <Daviey> stgraber: you re-wrote it from scratch?!

 16:22:38 <skaet> stgraber,  awsome.   Lets make sure its checked in and accessible so we don't go through this exercise again.  :)

 16:22:55 <stgraber> skaet: it also allows for monitoring of other queues like New if that's something useful for #ubuntu-release

 16:23:31 <stgraber> Daviey: yeah ... well, current version is < 60 lines of code, so wasn't exactly difficult ;)

 16:23:34 <stgraber> ..

 16:23:37 <skaet> stgraber,  yes,  that would be.   Lets talk about it in the #ubuntu-release channel after the meeting.

 16:24:11 * skaet wonders if it can say who accepted the unapproved too... ?  but later.  :)

 16:24:19 <skaet> [TOPIC] Server team Q&A - arosales

 16:24:30 <arosales> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000887.html

 16:24:35 <arosales> Apologies for the late post once again. We'll get our game together soon.

 16:24:42 <arosales> Not a lot of new items to report on this week. OpenStack keystone-lite will replace keystone in the next week.

 16:24:53 <arosales> Any questions?

 16:24:59 <Riddell> arosales: uploads in unapproved?

 16:25:04 <Riddell> swift?

 16:25:19 <Riddell> nova?  python-novaclient?

 16:25:27 <arosales> Daviey: any updates on swift ^

 16:25:36 <Daviey> Hey

 16:25:54 <Riddell> there are, and we need to be told why they're important for beta

 16:26:01 <Daviey> Riddell: What part of it?

 16:26:01 <Daviey> (can you expand the question)

 16:26:14 <Riddell> Daviey: we'll do this in #u-release

 16:26:19 <pitti> they don't link to any RC bugs (or other bugs)

 16:26:26 <pitti> so need a separate explanation

 16:26:32 <Daviey> Riddell: right... So.. for the last few releases it's been something which has been followed.

 16:26:47 <Daviey> We track usptream to completition, where they track our dev cycle.

 16:27:12 <Daviey> It has a good functional and unit test suite.

 16:27:32 <Daviey> If this is a process we should re-visit, then we can have that as a seperate discussion

 16:27:41 <Riddell> Daviey: all fine, what's the reason to upload during beta freeze?

 16:27:57 <Daviey> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20OpenStack%20Testing/ , is there to add confidence

 16:28:07 <skaet> arosales,  is bug 924739 any ETA when this is likely to land?

 16:28:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924739 in squid3 (Ubuntu Precise) "after upgrade from oneiric to precise, previous squid config unused, cannot be used when relocated" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924739

 16:28:45 <Daviey> Riddell: In retrospect, it could probably have been held back.. However, i'd quite like it to land in the beta.

 16:29:21 * skaet wondering if in time for beta or if this is release note material?

 16:29:22 <arosales> skaet: I need to check on an ETA with Adam, but the issue has been identified as far as the config.

 16:29:27 <Riddell> ok, a cheeky late upload, you can buy me and skaet and pitti beers to get it through

 16:29:50 <skaet> thanks arosales. :)

 16:30:10 <arosales> skaet: I'll follow up with you later today

 16:30:16 <pitti> arosales, Daviey: so you shall have it, accepted

 16:31:20 <skaet> [TOPIC] ARM team?   Q&A - ogra_

 16:31:24 <Daviey> pitti: thanks :)

 16:31:31 <ogra_> sooo ...

 16:31:37 <ogra_> let me shock you guys a bit :)

 16:31:42 <arosales> pitti: Riddell: skaet: thanks :-)

 16:31:53 <ogra_> there was no mail for ubuntu-arm ... since there is no ubuntu-arm anymore ...

 16:32:10 <ScottK> Where did it go?

 16:32:14 <ogra_> from monday on it is expected that all platform teams care for their arm bits themselves

 16:32:44 <ogra_> so i would like to ask Daviey to report for arm server issues, stgraber for arm foundation issues, pitti for arm desktop etc ...

 16:32:56 <ogra_> the team itself got spread across platform

 16:33:03 <pitti> yes, makes sense

 16:33:10 * skaet nods

 16:33:22 <ogra_> and indeed if you have arm issues, feel free to contact people from the former arm team during the transition time

 16:33:35 <pitti> FWIW, we already tracked arm* stuff the same like x86 in stable+1 and other tracking, but of course so far we relied on the arm team to sort out the difficult failurres

 16:33:54 <ogra_> theoretically every team was supposed to have an arm person during the transition ,... desktop somehow didnt get one though

 16:34:01 <ogra_> right

 16:34:17 <stgraber> oh, and I'd like to welcome ogra_ and infinity in the Foundations team (starting on Monday)!

 16:34:24 <ogra_> the expectation is that arm doesnt get treated differently from x86 or amd64 from now on

 16:34:56 <ogra_> heh, yeah, adam and i are in foundations now ... still caring for arm stuff ... but in the place where it should be cared for (platform)

 16:35:06 <ogra_> not in some elite team or so :)

 16:35:16 <ogra_> ..

 16:35:33 * skaet is glad to see ogra_ and infinity in foundations team too.  :)

 16:35:50 <Daviey> I'd rather see them in server :)

 16:36:06 <skaet> Thanks ogra_!

 16:36:24 <ogra_> Daviey, ask victorp, probably he can help here ;)

 16:36:32 <Riddell> ogra_: so desktop should be hiring someone?

 16:36:53 <pitti> well, we don't hire an amd64 person

 16:36:59 <ogra_> right

 16:37:00 <pitti> I guess we just need to get some arm hardware

 16:37:05 <Riddell> pitti: ok but do we have the hardware and skills needed?

 16:37:10 <pitti> hardware, no

 16:37:12 <ogra_> yeah, your manager should approve a panda or so

 16:37:18 <Riddell> pitti: I do, but I need time and help to set it up

 16:37:20 <victorp> Daviey we could move you to foudations as a swap :)

 16:37:24 <pitti> skills> I expect most of the difficult stuff (compiler, linux) to not live in desktop anyway

 16:37:29 <ogra_> victorp, lol

 16:37:32 <pitti> so far any arm issue I looked at was relatively easy

 16:37:46 <ogra_> if its not LibO or mono, thats true

 16:37:49 <Riddell> pitti: graphics is fiddly for arm, anything using gl

 16:37:53 <ogra_> there are a bunch of nasty packages

 16:37:55 <ogra_> ..

 16:37:55 <Riddell> and of course qt and the qreal fun

 16:38:02 <pitti> it took me two days to fix a postgresql bug, but I guess in cases like theses we can still knock on infinity's or janimo's door and ask kindly

 16:38:09 <ScottK> Riddell: Those are at least easy (if tiring)

 16:38:13 <ogra_> right

 16:38:22 <pitti> Riddell: true that

 16:38:26 <Riddell> ScottK: you can also rent out your arm machines to desktop for a suitably large fee

 16:38:27 <ogra_> the arm team isnt gone, we are just in other places

 16:38:49 <ScottK> Once I get a new router for that network segment.  Sure.

 16:38:57 <Daviey> ScottK: Talking of which... what happend to those MOTU machines?

 16:39:02 <Daviey> ScottK: you had 2 x ARM machines for MOTU use?

 16:39:07 <Riddell> ScottK: new issues aren't so easy, I couldn't work out a fix for compiz

 16:39:07 <Daviey> \o/

 16:39:12 <ScottK> Daviey: See my previous comment about dead router.

 16:39:34 <Riddell> ScottK: get jason to expense it

 16:39:46 <skaet> [TOPIC] Linaro team Q&A - fabo

 16:39:47 <Riddell> (but he's on holiday for the next week i think)

 16:39:48 <ScottK> Also they aren't hardware Ubuntu supports, so I have to rework them to a more modern release.  Probably debian testing armhf.

 16:40:03 <fabo_> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000889.html

 16:40:04 <ScottK> Riddell: It's not the cost it's the time to drive to the store.

 16:40:32 <fabo_> in addition, we want to update live-build (as discussed with skaet)

 16:40:52 <fabo_> after beta1 might be a good timing

 16:41:22 <skaet> stgraber, pitti, ScottK, Riddell, ^ any thoughts about timing/concerns?

 16:41:22 <fabo_> Thanks to Ubuntu ARM team and see you in your new assignment :)

 16:41:26 <fabo_> ..

 16:41:44 <skaet> thanks fabo_ :)

 16:42:00 <ScottK> I'd suggest if it's ready now, sooner is better than later.

 16:42:02 <pitti> skaet: linaro builds shouldn't affect us?

 16:42:30 <stgraber> sorry I need a second, the linaro e-mail got on the list very late so haven't had a chance to read pre-meeting

 16:42:53 <skaet> pitti, thought there might be common code,  but we can carry on the discussion in #ubuntu-release after meeting.

 16:43:55 <stgraber> fabo_: would like to see some details on what's in that update live-build and how it'll impact Ubuntu, though #ubuntu-release is fine for that

 16:44:12 <fabo_> stgraber: ok, np.

 16:45:00 <skaet> fabo_,  any thoughts on when the smaller compiz patch (OpenGL ES2.0) will be available for review?

 16:45:43 <fabo_> skaet: no ideas right now, but asap. it's a high prio

 16:46:03 <skaet> fabo_,  fair 'nuf.  Thanks.

 16:46:41 <skaet> [TOPIC] Desktop Team Q&A  - pitti

 16:46:48 <pitti> report at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000880.html

 16:46:57 <pitti> st landed new firefox/tbird with an estimated 5 MB saving of CD space, leaving some 3 or 4 to be taken off

 16:46:59 <pitti> option 1 (and my preferred one) is to drop python3 again by switching lsb-release back to python2; lsb-release is currently the only package using python3 on the CD, so we'd carry those 4.5 MBs just for this

 16:47:01 <pitti> the default option is as always to kick off yet another langpack; we only have Spanish, Portugese, and Chinese left to sacrifice now, though

 16:47:03 <pitti> ..

 16:47:29 <pitti> ScottK, doko, stgraber: any opinion on python3?

 16:47:31 <ogra_> skaet, i'll still take care for that patch on teh plkatform side ... no worries, i'll keep you updated

 16:47:32 <ogra_> ..

 16:47:49 <Riddell> pitti: any reason not to drop python3?

 16:47:49 * skaet thanks ogra_ :)

 16:47:54 <ScottK> pitti: Removing it would make barry very sad.

 16:48:06 <pitti> I bet

 16:48:09 <ScottK> Other than that, I think it's fine.

 16:48:15 <pitti> but carrying it for a 20 line lsb-release script seems a bit heavy

 16:48:21 * ScottK agrees.

 16:48:24 <doko> pitti: apport still not using python3? lame ...

 16:48:32 <pitti> doko: -ENOLAUNCHPADLIB

 16:48:43 <pitti> at least from next cycle on we'll have bigger image sizes

 16:49:09 <stgraber> I tend to agree carrying a full language for just a 20 lines script sounds like a waste of space, it's sad not more stuff are using python3 yet though

 16:49:13 <ScottK> Dropping it would help all the images, right?

 16:49:17 <pitti> yes

 16:49:19 <doko> pitti: please check with barry, I'm fine with it

 16:49:26 <pitti> ack

 16:50:10 <skaet> Thanks pitti.   sounds like we have a decision.

 16:50:26 * skaet won't bring it up at end now.... ;)

 16:50:29 <pitti> I'll prepare the upload after barry acks

 16:50:51 <skaet> any other questions for desktop before moving on? ...

 16:51:07 <skaet> [TOPIC] Unity Framework Team Q&A - dbarth

 16:51:41 <skaet> hmm... don't see dbarth in the channel...

 16:52:00 <skaet> [TOPIC] Unity Services and Settings Team  Q&A - Cimi

 16:52:05 <Cimi> hello!

 16:52:18 <Cimi> [LINK] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000884.html

 16:52:39 <Cimi> Yet another intense week for the team :-)

 16:52:58 <Cimi> as you can see, lots of bugs fixed

 16:53:18 <Cimi> thanks to Coverity as well, nice work from the QA team and our engineer

 16:53:38 <Cimi> we were able to spot new bugs and improve the quality of our libraries

 16:53:49 <Cimi> on the FFe/UIFes

 16:54:01 <Cimi> I've updated the list with the remaining links

 16:54:17 <Cimi> I'd like to hear your feedback on this side, if there's any

 16:54:58 <Cimi> especially on the the two requests of the GMenuModel in Hud, and extended support for XUL apps

 16:55:21 <Cimi> we're not sure they should be considered as bugfixes or exceptions

 16:56:07 <Cimi> on the UIFe, I think there shouldn't be problems for the 1st one, the 2nd I was currently working on

 16:56:34 <Cimi> I'll try to make the change really subtle (and not as in the bugreport community contribution)

 16:56:43 <Cimi> I'm open to all your requests

 16:56:43 <Cimi> ..

 16:57:38 <skaet> pitti, any concerns from desktop team on the FFes/UIFes  ?

 16:57:59 <pitti> I haven't actually seen a lot from DX?

 16:58:09 <pitti> we got two metric tons from online services

 16:58:20 <pitti> (or I don't remember any more)

 16:58:45 <Riddell> pitti: "tonnes" :)

 16:58:57 <skaet> heh,  yeah its that time in the release... memory stack overflow for all.

 16:59:56 <skaet> Cimi,  thanks for the details.   Will follow up after meeting.

 17:00:04 <Cimi> cool

 17:00:56 <Cimi> I think I'm done then, all silent means all good :-)

 17:01:00 <skaet> Thanks to the team for all the bug fixes.  :)

 17:01:13 <Cimi> our pleasure and our job :)

 17:01:15 <skaet> yup silence is good. :)

 17:01:28 <skaet> [TOPIC] Kubuntu Team Q&A - Riddell

 17:01:55 <Riddell> hi

 17:02:00 <Riddell> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000888.html

 17:02:16 <Riddell> still more politics than coding but kubuntu-active might appear any time now

 17:02:19 <Riddell> ..

 17:02:39 <skaet> Thanks Riddell.

 17:03:12 * skaet figures that Riddell gets to teach the publishers about it,  if its ready for B1 - so that issue will get handled ;)

 17:03:28 <skaet> [TOPIC] Edubuntu Team Q&A - stgraber or highvoltage

 17:03:38 <stgraber> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-February/000875.html

 17:04:04 <stgraber> I think we're in pretty good shape for beta-1 now and don't expect much to change for this cycle

 17:04:11 <skaet> :)

 17:04:15 * skaet glad to hear that

 17:04:21 <stgraber> we'll probably get more bugfix releases of epoptes and LTSP but both projects are in feature freeze too

 17:04:39 <stgraber> ..

 17:04:53 <skaet> Thanks stgraber.:)

 17:05:02 <skaet> [TOPIC] Xubuntu Team Q&A - madnick

 17:05:53 * skaet sees madnick in the channel....

 17:05:59 <skaet> any other xubuntu folk around?

 17:07:04 <skaet> not seeing ubuntu studio folk either,  and lubuntu said they'll not make it.

 17:07:14 <skaet> [TOPIC] MOTU Team Q&A - tumbleweed or Laney

 17:07:36 * ScottK knows there's a GHC6 transition going on.

 17:08:10 <skaet> thanks ScottK.

 17:08:47 <skaet> just a reminder to all,  if an unseeded universe package/fix is ready - please highlight that on #ubuntu-release channel, so we can let it through during the beta freeze.

 17:09:12 <ScottK> I'm been pushing them through as I see them.

 17:09:16 <ScottK> I'm / I've

 17:09:25 <skaet> thanks ScottK.  :)

 17:09:29 <skaet> [TOPIC] Any other business, comments,  questions?

 17:09:32 <pitti> me too, yes

 17:09:36 <ScottK> I'm guessing that what's in queue for the powerpc builders already will have them busy most of the weekend.  There's LO and two openjdk uploads that aren't even started yet.  Particularly since it's gcc and a kernel build in progress now.

 17:09:40 <pitti> skaet: meeting format/

 17:10:05 <skaet> pitti,  ok - we're over the hour, but yes..  :)

 17:10:22 <Riddell> I'd rather have an open meeting

 17:10:23 <skaet> Proposal on the table is to change the format of this meeting

 17:10:32 <Riddell> it would encourage me to send the e-mail earlier

 17:10:34 <skaet> to an open meeting,  rather than a round table.

 17:10:44 <Riddell> and to read over other e-mails if skaet pinged 30 mins before the meeting :)

 17:10:51 <pitti> so we'll throw in questions instead of waiting for our turn

 17:11:01 <skaet> For this to work,  e-mails will need to be in 2 hours before the meeting.

 17:11:04 <ScottK> Sending the mails doesn't seem to have shortened the meeting as it is.

 17:11:09 <pitti> yes, the idea was to read the mails before theh meeting and then have questions ready

 17:11:19 <pitti> well, it used to be 1.5 hours

 17:11:21 <Riddell> the current format is too much waiting for no good reason

 17:11:43 <pitti> but I guess many people do other stuff at the side, which probably slows it down as a whole

 17:11:48 * pitti is guilty of that himself

 17:11:51 <skaet> If folks can get their emails in we can try the open format after the initial annonce.

 17:11:58 <ScottK> Could we just have a discussion on the mail list and do away with the meeting?

 17:12:13 <Riddell> nah meeting is useful

 17:12:20 <skaet> ScottK,  its efficient for some issues to get resolved to have this meeting.

 17:12:23 <highvoltage> oops, I missed the Edubuntu part (I guess that's a problem with the waiting, you get distracted :) )

 17:12:25 <Riddell> but it can be short without all the waiting

 17:12:32 <Riddell> highvoltage++

 17:12:39 <ScottK> OK.  Maybe people should ask their questions on the list as much as possible too.

 17:12:54 <pitti> yes, I think IRC has better turnarounds

 17:12:56 <skaet> ScottK ++

 17:13:13 <ScottK> pitti: Sure, but let's keep the meeting to the stuff that really needs to be real time.

 17:13:18 <pitti> but we could certainly do 30 intense minutes (or less in some meetings which aren't right before a beta) instead of the waiting round

 17:13:21 <Riddell> skaet: can you send a reminder to send e-mails and another one 30 mins before meeting to read over them?

 17:13:39 <pitti> ScottK: right, and we did resolve questions on the ML before, too (I agree, when possible that makes sense)

 17:14:01 <skaet> Riddell,   its early in the morning for me,  rather this just be a self reminding cron job for folks if they need reminders.

 17:14:20 * arosales will work on getting Server team update in a timely manner

 17:15:18 <skaet> all in favor of having emails in 2 hours before,  and going to open forum Q&A session,  please vote  +1,  all wanting to keep with current round table -1 please.....  anyone know the runes?

 17:15:45 * skaet figures there's a way to trigger the vote and get those quiet ones to weigh in..

 17:15:57 <Riddell> skaet: cron is fine :)

 17:15:58 <pitti> #vote
