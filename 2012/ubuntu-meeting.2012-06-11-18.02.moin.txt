 18:02:28 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Review of any previous action items

 18:02:28 <mdeslaur> No previous action items.

 18:02:34 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:02:37 <mdeslaur> I'll go first

 18:02:50 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week. I'm off on thursday and friday

 18:03:01 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on mysql updates which should be out today

 18:03:11 <mdeslaur> and have some other stuff queued up behind that

 18:03:22 <mdeslaur> and wednesday I'm on patch piloting duty

 18:03:27 <mdeslaur> that's it for me. sbeattie

 18:03:32 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up!

 18:04:06 <sbeattie> I'm on triage this week

 18:04:48 <sbeattie> I'll also be working on synchronizing the versions of openjdk 6 for the older releases

 18:05:18 <mdeslaur> buildd DoS :)

 18:05:26 <sbeattie> heh, yeah

 18:06:04 <sbeattie> I need to get the apparmor SRU for precise back on the front burner, it keeps falling behind the stove.

 18:06:16 <sbeattie> I think that's it for me.

 18:06:25 <sbeattie> micahg: you're up

 18:06:32 <micahg> sbeattie: you don't want to look behind my stove ;)

 18:07:19 <micahg> anyways, looking into potential regressions in the pending thunderbird 13 update, then back to webkit, with a side of chromium hopefully if my fix for the translations issue works

 18:07:55 <micahg> I was asked by the Thunderbird QA team if we can get some Ubuntu folk helping with Thunderbird QA test days, next one is here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:QA_TestDay:2012-06-14

 18:08:38 <micahg> Knowing that our builds work up front helps us push out the release faster as we shouldn't be running into show stoppers after the final builds are spun

 18:08:56 <micahg> people can use the ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-next builds for the Thunderbird QA test day

 18:09:32 <micahg> if there are no questions, I'll pass the baton to tyhicks

 18:09:47 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 18:11:03 <tyhicks> I am still trying to get all of my ecryptfs patches out to the list. The number of patches grew last week because a fuzzer keeps hitting a BUG() in the /dev/ecryptfs code. I've got that fixed now, too.

 18:11:17 <tyhicks> The LUKS work item is still next on my list

 18:11:25 <tyhicks> then I'll get back to updates

 18:11:35 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 18:11:43 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 18:13:06 <jjohansen> okay, I need to finish up some last minute testing on an embargoed issue, and then I need to get back to my essential work items

 18:13:34 * jjohansen was thinking of working on set perm tracking

 18:14:12 <jjohansen> oh and I suppose I need to update work items, /me hasn't been doing that for the last couple of weeks

 18:14:42 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: that would be nice, yeah :)

 18:14:53 <jjohansen> I think that is it from /me back to you mdeslaur

 18:15:03 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:15:09 <mdeslaur> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 18:15:09 <mdeslaur> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.
