 16:02:33 <jamespage> ...

 16:02:41 <jamespage> #topic Quantal Development

 16:02:54 <jamespage> hopefully not much of that going on now.

 16:03:13 <jamespage> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:03:21 <jamespage> looking goog

 16:03:24 <jamespage> good even

 16:03:31 <jamespage> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:03:56 <jamespage> a few outstanding - one of which I think is resolved but that needs confirmation

 16:04:07 <jamespage> the samba printing bug is still proving hard to reproduce.

 16:04:08 <jamespage> ...

 16:04:13 <jamespage> onto blueprints

 16:04:27 <jamespage> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-overview.html

 16:04:59 <jamespage> Not going to review individual BP's; but suffice to say POSTPONED is appropriate now...

 16:05:15 <jamespage> some WI's may carry over to next release - please do so

 16:05:42 <jamespage> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:06:05 <jamespage> openstack design summit is currently underway - lots of representation from Ubuntu Server Team

 16:06:17 <jamespage> Ubuntu Dev Summit in 1.5 weeks time - don't miss it

 16:06:29 <jamespage> anything from anyone else?

 16:07:02 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:07:07 <jamespage> hggdh: around?

 16:07:29 <jamespage> nope - ok moving on

 16:07:33 <arosales> Hello, sorry I am late

 16:07:34 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:07:40 <smb> uh

 16:07:46 <jamespage> hey arosales - could be the quickest meeting on record!

 16:07:54 <smb> Not really much (or anything) to mention

 16:07:55 <smb> ..

 16:08:18 <jamespage> smb, actually bug 1054129

 16:08:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1054129 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Quantal) "reboot with -vga cirrus can result in broken output" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1054129

 16:08:33 <jamespage> is that the same issue that you where looking at with the cirrus driver in KVM?

 16:08:34 * smb shrugs

 16:08:47 <smb> I would first need to read the bug report

 16:08:48 <hallyn> think it was taken care of by removing a cirrus driver from kernel?

 16:08:56 <smb> hallyn, yes for now

 16:09:07 <smb> Will re-appear in R to hopefully sort things

 16:09:22 <jamespage> hallyn, I think we can close that bug for the time being them - I can't reproduce....

 16:09:26 <jamespage> and that would explain why...

 16:09:28 <jamespage> go-oh

 16:09:50 <hallyn> "doctor, it hurts when".... "then remove the driver"

 16:10:06 <jamespage> lol

 16:10:08 <jamespage> ...

 16:10:11 <jamespage> next...

 16:10:15 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:10:18 <jamespage> anything rbasak?

 16:10:31 <rbasak> Nothing to report. It's looking good for release!

 16:10:40 <jamespage> excellent

 16:10:41 <rbasak> Any questions for me?

 16:11:20 <jamespage> sounds like no

 16:11:23 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion

 16:11:33 <jamespage> anyone have anything to raise?

 16:11:39 <arosales> \o

 16:11:51 <jamespage> arosales, go for it

 16:12:03 <arosales> jamespage:  did you cover https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server?searchtext=servercloud+q delivery status?

 16:12:11 * arosales apologizes again for being late

 16:12:36 <arosales> ie we have some BP with non-closed/done "Delivery" states

 16:12:54 <jamespage> not specifically but general director was complete blueprints and carry over any relevant work items

 16:13:39 <arosales> jamespage could we step through the BP with non done delivery, ie Beta Available, Informational or Deferred states.

 16:13:47 <arosales> with the folks that are here

 16:13:58 <arosales> rbasak: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-deployment

 16:14:06 <arosales> Delivery = Good progress

 16:14:37 <rbasak> One to postpone, and the other is done. I'll amend now.

 16:14:47 <arosales> m_3: how do you feel about [mark-mims] Charm testing on ARM (emulation only): TODO

 16:15:42 * rbasak just postponed that

 16:15:47 <arosales> rbasak: m_3: did you guys get an opportunity to test ARM on MAAS?

 16:16:08 <rbasak> AIUI, it's pending some more work on m_3 on the charm side of things

 16:16:13 <rbasak> I haven't fully synced with m_3 yet

 16:16:36 <arosales> ok perhaps m_3 can chime in

 16:16:43 <arosales> jamespage: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:16:49 <arosales> most of those are for Ursinha

 16:16:54 <arosales> do we want to postpone those?

 16:16:59 <jamespage> I've deffered the BP generally

 16:17:26 <jamespage> done

 16:17:40 <arosales> jamespage; thanks

 16:17:53 <arosales> m_3: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:17:58 <arosales> or jimbaker^

 16:18:28 <jimbaker> arosales, that's currently making good progress

 16:18:56 <arosales> jimbaker: feel wi should be done before end of week?

 16:19:26 <m_3> unit tests we should close out

 16:19:32 <arosales> run charmtester against maas environment: TODO

 16:19:49 <arosales> m_3: this should also help with the earlier question in regards to ARM deployment

 16:19:51 <m_3> there're a couple that're inprogress, but they're not tied to a cycle... I'm thinking we postpone then in that blueprint

 16:20:02 <m_3> yeah, it's the same work-item

 16:20:21 <arosales> ok, I'll mark the BP as "Beta  Available"

 16:20:44 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-release-process is for spamaps

 16:21:02 <arosales> just one wi there create spec to allow charms to depend on juju versions: INPROGRESS

 16:21:39 <arosales> skipping https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-deployment-on-armnt

 16:22:02 <arosales> jamespage: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bigdata-hadoop

 16:22:16 <jamespage> arosales, I deferred that blueprint

 16:22:17 <arosales> sorry that is deferred

 16:22:19 <arosales> :-)

 16:22:26 <jamespage> (only just :-))

 16:23:00 <arosales> m_3: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:23:25 <arosales> looks mostly done

 16:23:39 <arosales> jcastro [jorge] Choose a single place for presenting flagbearer charms (charm browser?): TODO

 16:23:40 <m_3> thought it was... looking

 16:24:09 <arosales> I'll sync up with jcastro on his remaining work items and them move delivery to "implemented"

 16:24:45 <arosales> rbasak: may want to sync up with craig on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-benchmark-and-performance

 16:25:30 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-awstools looks mostly done. I'll sync up with utlemming on remaining wi

 16:26:11 <arosales> jamespage: ok that covers the BPs with non done "Delivery" status

 16:26:22 <arosales> jamespage:  back to you, thanks for letting me interject

 16:26:24 <jamespage> arosales, ack - thanks for that
