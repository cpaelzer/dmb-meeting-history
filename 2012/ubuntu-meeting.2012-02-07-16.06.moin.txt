 16:06:58 <utlemming> smoser: we need to welcome Justinlw to the Server team

 16:07:03 <smoser> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:07:13 <smoser> * jamespage to get juju MIR's added to server precise release tracking

 16:07:16 <smoser> jamespage, ^

 16:07:19 <jamespage> smoser: done

 16:07:23 <jamespage> ta Daviey

 16:07:25 <smoser> moving on

 16:07:26 <arosales> welcome justinlw! :-)

 16:07:33 <smoser> [TOPIC] Precise Development

 16:07:38 * justinlw nods, waves

 16:07:53 <Daviey> Feature Freeze next Thursday, anything outstanding?

 16:07:54 * smoser is not ignoring that, just figured it was more "open discussion" or some other section than 'review action points'

 16:08:09 <arosales> smoser: roger, I just jumped the gun

 16:08:14 <rbasak> I should get my openmpi test builds done before then

 16:08:47 <Daviey> rbasak: Great.. rbasak, can you raise a warning this time next week if not?

 16:08:52 <rbasak> will do

 16:09:04 <Daviey> maas will be uploaded this Thursday, pending review.

 16:09:12 <Daviey> Anything else of concern?

 16:09:13 <hallyn> we really want apparmor mount controls before ff

 16:09:24 <rbasak> Also from my end, console fifo patch into nova? Is that a feature?

 16:09:26 <hallyn> and netcf in main, and enabled in libvirt

 16:09:31 <Daviey> hallyn: Does that have a bug?  Dangers it won't be reached?

 16:09:36 <zul> rbasak: yeah ill stick in today

 16:09:47 <hallyn> Daviey: it has bugs depending on it, but no explicit bug

 16:09:58 <hallyn> jjohansen would know what danger of not being reached is right now.

 16:10:00 <rbasak> Cool, thanks zul!

 16:10:06 <hallyn> i know he has a lot to juggle, not sure where it's at

 16:10:07 <Daviey> hallyn: ok, i'll discuss it in -server after the meeting.

 16:10:12 <hallyn> ok

 16:10:16 <Daviey> smoser: Do you want to itterate over the todo bugs?

 16:10:28 <smoser> i can..

 16:10:42 <smoser> link ?

 16:10:53 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:11:06 <smoser> bug 924739

 16:11:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924739 in squid3 (Ubuntu Precise) "after upgrade from oneiric to precise, previous squid config unused, cannot be used when relocated" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924739

 16:11:29 <adam_g> i helped triage that one

 16:11:39 <smoser> yeah... and i think its significant.

 16:11:44 <adam_g> but am unsure of a solution, and was hoping we might be able to discuss the squid3 transition in forum

 16:11:47 <smoser> i'm not sure what we've done on transition of other packages before.

 16:11:57 <smoser> i'm assuming there is good prior art

 16:11:58 <Daviey> adam_g: do you have capacity to drive it, or is it better with roaksoax ?

 16:12:11 <smoser> but ending up with no running proxy seems not so nice.

 16:12:38 <adam_g> Daviey: i'd be happy to look into possible solutions if someone can point me toward other packages that have gone through similar transitions in the past, where config files have moved to different locations with new syntax

 16:13:01 <Daviey> adam_g: okay, lets take it to -server, after.

 16:13:09 <adam_g> Daviey: +1

 16:13:10 <smoser> bug 883988

 16:13:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 883988 in glance (Ubuntu Precise) "db migration failing when upgrading glance - trying to create existing tables" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/883988

 16:13:43 <adam_g> smoser: theres still no movement on that, i was hoping it'd be fixed during their bug squashing day but there still seems to be disagreement among developers up stream on how to handle database migrations.

 16:13:45 <smoser> adam_g, should you just dupe that ?

 16:14:08 <adam_g> smoser: yeah, there was a lot of conversion about hte issue on another bug last week, ill try to find that add a link as well

 16:14:21 <smoser> you put a reference in the bug

 16:14:24 <Daviey> adam_g: can you open discussion with upstream and see what we should do?

 16:14:28 <smoser> bug 779311

 16:17:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 911812 in facter (Ubuntu Precise) "processor fact does not handle arm, others" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/911812

 16:17:22 <Daviey> roaksoax: ?

 16:17:38 <roaksoax> Daviey: adam_g was working on it and AFAIK he requested access to the arm cluster to work on it

 16:17:57 <Daviey> ahh

 16:18:06 <roaksoax> Daviey: though it was determined that upstream contains the fix for it, we just need to SRU

 16:18:08 <Daviey> rbasak: Do you think you could chime in?

 16:18:08 <smoser> adam_g, refute or deny in #ubuntu-server

 16:18:22 <smoser> bug 913009

 16:18:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 913009 in bacula (Ubuntu) "package bacula-common-mysql (not installed) failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/bacula/libbaccats.la', which is also in package bacula-common 5.2.1-0ubuntu2" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/913009

 16:19:19 <smoser> branch is still under review there. maybe hazmat can ping a bit.

 16:19:24 <roaksoax> adam_g: will sure do.

 16:19:35 <roaksoax> rbasak: will prepare SRU's and give them for you to test!

 16:20:10 <smoser> that seems somewhat significant

 16:20:35 <zul> from me?

 16:20:39 <Daviey> it's a Conflicts issue.

 16:21:44 <smoser> Daviey, did you think that was going to get fixed upstream?

 16:23:23 <roaksoax> Daviey: ready to merge

 16:23:37 <smoser> Daviey, so should that be closed on openstack-compute ?

 16:23:39 <roaksoax> Daviey: though holding it till I succesfully test the maas

 16:24:18 <Daviey> roaksoax: just land it for orchestra, we'll adjust for next version

 16:24:27 <roaksoax> Daviey: cool then

 16:24:28 <Daviey> smoser: It's unclear.. I'd leave the task open for a bt

 16:25:08 <Daviey> SpamapS might like to add his thoughts?

 16:25:12 <roaksoax> Daviey: it was marked invalid as I couldn't reproduce it

 16:25:18 <roaksoax> Daviey: it was just re-openfor what I can see

 16:25:22 <roaksoax> Daviey: will look into it again

 16:25:23 <Daviey> With the current discussion going on RE: mysql - that bug might need adjusting

 16:27:31 <SpamapS> Daviey: re the mysql bug.. its been pending for a while.. simple fix. I think there's a dupe in mysql-5.5 that is marked High

 16:27:39 <Daviey> I think oversized is fixed?

 16:27:41 * Daviey checks

 16:28:15 <Daviey> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise/job/precise-server-amd64_minimal-virtual/

 16:28:18 <smoser> thanks

 16:28:22 <koolhead17> also Daviey for 875262 there is big merge coming so SpamapS suggested me to hold on :P

 16:28:28 <SpamapS> re PHP, I've asked koolhead17 to lay off, given the weirdness coming from Debian

 16:28:51 <SpamapS> I had given up on php 5.4.0 , but some folks have privately asked me to take a second look at it

 16:29:07 <Daviey> zul: ^^ ?

 16:29:17 <Daviey> SpamapS: sounds good.

 16:29:23 <SpamapS> There's a discussion happening today in the Debian php group about suhosin also

 16:29:29 <smoser> well, per adam_g

 16:29:30 <smoser> Note: This will likely be marked invalid soon, as the openstackx library is soon to be marked deprecated and removed in favor of python-novaclient.

 16:30:10 <adam_g> smoser: yes, thats still true. id like to confirm whether or not thats actually happened yet

 16:30:18 <adam_g> smoser: will mark the bug invalid as soon as i can do that

 16:30:23 <smoser> adam_g, yeah. thanks.

 16:30:25 <Daviey> oh, nice

 16:30:50 <adam_g> zul: what about in nova?

 16:30:59 <zul> smoser:  please

 16:31:00 <smoser> (but in my opinion,that is extremely low importance)

 16:31:09 <zul> adam_g: i think its gone as well

 16:31:41 <smoser> i fear i'm going to get sick to my stomach looking from reading the stack trace though

 16:31:42 <smoser> yuck

 16:34:00 * rbasak owes zul a beer

 16:34:06 <Daviey> jamespage: How is lynxman's ipxe upload?

 16:34:11 <lynxman> smoser: still need to finish some comments on the new ipxe package, as soon as those are done this bug will be fixed

 16:34:16 <zul> rbasak: more than one

 16:34:22 <smoser> lynxman, gracias

 16:34:27 <Daviey> lynxman: can this be done by EoW?

 16:34:58 <lynxman> Daviey: will try but cant say

 16:35:41 <Daviey> lynxman: We are depending on you :)

 16:35:47 <smoser> utlemming, can i assign that to you for further invfestigation?

 16:35:59 <utlemming> smoser: yup

 16:36:01 <smoser> take a look at that bug, it is interesting.

 16:36:03 <lynxman> Daviey: I have zero allowance from management on this one, will try to push a nighter to do it :)

 16:36:22 <smoser> the 'du --apparent-size' of / on oneiric and precise is very similar, but 'df' reports a completely different story.

 16:36:38 <smoser> bug 833499

 16:36:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 833499 in OpenStack Compute (nova) "virt/disk.py unconditionally inserts public_keys into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/833499

 16:36:55 <smoser> i dont think that is going to get fixed up stream unless one of us do it.

 16:37:01 <smoser> and i think it'd be a feature request too...

 16:37:02 <smoser> so..

 16:37:23 <smoser> i tihnk we should take it off this list for essex/precise. its low enough priority with the cloud-init work around

 16:37:27 <smoser> Daviey, ?

 16:37:38 <smoser> bug 901881

 16:37:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova should depend on python-keystone" [Low,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:37:59 <Daviey> smoser: how importiant?

 16:38:07 <smoser> low at best

 16:38:15 <Daviey> smoser: it's not a feature IMO

 16:38:28 <Daviey> smoser: lets utrack it.

 16:38:30 <smoser> it is a feature from openstack perspective.

 16:38:30 <Daviey> untack

 16:39:22 <smoser> that bug is fix-released

 16:39:24 <smoser> why is it in this list?

 16:39:40 <smoser> er... why is ther ea glace task

 16:39:55 <smoser> adam_g, ?

 16:39:56 <Daviey> smoser: glance has the same bug

 16:40:05 <Daviey> the title doesn't reflect it

 16:40:06 <smoser> ah. k. so who is driving that fix?

 16:40:23 <Daviey> zul: Did you say there was a pending upload?

 16:40:30 <Daviey> (which should now be in the archive?)

 16:41:01 <zul> still waiting for keystonelight

 16:41:05 <adam_g> isn't keystone is still going thru MIR, probably a new MIR?

 16:41:08 <Daviey> zul: uh?

 16:41:13 <Daviey> glance is blocked on keystonelight?

 16:41:24 <zul> it shouldnt be and isnt

 16:41:49 <zul> keystone needs a new security review as well

 16:41:50 * Daviey confused.

 16:41:56 <zul> as am i

 16:42:03 <zul> can we talk about it after the meeting?

 16:42:08 <Daviey> zul: k

 16:42:19 <zul> still juggling alot of plates

 16:42:38 <smoser> that has the honorable rbasak assigned

 16:42:43 <rbasak> I can't remember if this has progressed since last week.

 16:42:54 <Daviey> smoser: i read that as horrible !

 16:42:56 <smoser> k. please poke at it a bit and see if you can't make it do so.

 16:43:00 <rbasak> I have a PPA build that succeeds. Need to try rdepend builds against it next.

 16:43:20 <rbasak> Readers should note that I have no means of actually testing any of these packages apart from that they build.

 16:43:20 <smoser> Daviey, if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all

 16:43:39 <Daviey> rbasak: if it compiles, lets ship it :)

 16:43:43 <rbasak> I'd appreciate input from stakeholders on testing - otherwise they won't get tested.

 16:44:30 <smoser> ah. oh yeah, dave walker was opener.

 16:45:04 <smoser> regarding squid proxy, there is a thread on an internal canonical mailing list that i tihnk might get orchestra-proxy moving in a different manner.

 16:45:11 <smoser> or at least help us collect some information.

 16:45:14 <Daviey> smoser: we should probably move on?

 16:45:17 <smoser> yep

 16:45:24 <roaksoax> smoser: upstream issue

 16:45:42 <smoser> roaksoax, pleaes open upstream bug or task then ?

 16:45:53 <roaksoax> smoser: i'm yet unsuare whether we should have a newer upstream release which supposedly fixes that

 16:46:01 <smoser> k.

 16:46:04 <smoser> well poke a bit please.

 16:46:07 <roaksoax> due to the latest issues we've been experiencing

 16:46:09 <roaksoax> smoser: will do

 16:46:15 <smoser> i think thats all we hae vor this section

 16:46:18 <smoser> thank fully

 16:46:28 <smoser> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:46:41 <smoser> anyone have anything here?

 16:47:45 <smoser> k. looks like nothing.

 16:47:45 <Daviey> Thankfully, no

 16:47:49 <smoser> me moving on.

 16:47:52 <smoser> hggdh,

 16:47:55 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:48:30 <smoser> i'll just state here that the openstack jenkins stuff is awesome.

 16:48:38 <smoser> big round of applause to adam_g zul jamespage

 16:48:47 <arosales> +1

 16:48:47 <smb> \o/

 16:48:54 <smoser> and surely others that I am missing and who can swear at me later.

 16:49:12 <smoser> for the reference: https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20OpenStack%20Testing/

 16:49:13 <koolhead17> adam_g: i need the doc though 4 charm deployment :P

 16:49:16 <smoser> smb, is up  now

 16:49:22 <Daviey> \o/

 16:49:27 <smoser> [TOPIC]

 16:49:28 <smoser> Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:49:31 <smb> * Trying to hunt down why libvirt-bin needs to be restarted before it

 16:49:31 <smb> gives me running domU's, I first removed all the other error sources

 16:49:31 <smb> from the logs. One was my fault of experimenting with qemu-dm paths.

 16:49:31 <smb> * Other source was libvirt insisting in running pm-is-supported from

 16:49:31 <smb> pm-utils without insisting (depending) on installing it.

 16:49:33 <smb> Question is that pebcak or something worth adding to libvirt-bin's

 16:49:35 <smb> runtime dependencies?

 16:49:37 <smb> * Currently looking at remoteDispatchNumOfDomainsHelper which should

 16:49:39 <smb> give one the IDs of guests but only seems to do that after restarting

 16:49:41 <smb> libvirtd. The call to remoteDispatchNumOfDefinedDomainsHelper on the

 16:49:43 <smb> other hand works all the time.

 16:49:59 <smb> ..

 16:50:08 <smoser> smb, it was failing ?

 16:50:17 <smoser> i really cant see that (libvirt due to pm-is-supported)

 16:50:39 <smb> smoser, No, that was just cluttering the log

 16:50:42 <smoser> i'm almost certain i've run vms on generally headless systems. if it fails, please open a bug. if it just warns, then suggests or recommends is probably right.

 16:50:45 <smb> So its more cosmetical

 16:50:51 <smoser> cosmetical

 16:50:52 <smoser> nice.

 16:51:21 <smoser> smb, well i dont have anything for you.

 16:51:29 <smoser> but i am remembering this bug

 16:51:29 <Daviey> smb: Have a bug number?

 16:51:30 * smb likes the sound of that

 16:51:51 <Daviey> smoser is off form.

 16:51:53 <smoser> bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/898373

 16:51:54 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 898373 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "fsck.ext3: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/xvda2" [High,Confirmed]

 16:52:01 <smb> Daviey, Not for the pm-utils dependency. I was not sure this is really that important

 16:52:03 <smoser> that is not related to kernel, but Daviey probably should be tracked

 16:52:15 <smoser> i'll get it into a beter state, updated with the info i have in my head

 16:52:22 <smoser> and one other bug will come out of it

 16:52:40 <smb> smoser, Hm, not sure I remember that one

 16:52:47 <smoser> smb, not kernel related.

 16:52:57 <smoser> just was thinking about it as i was thinking of "why does ec2 suck sometimes"

 16:53:05 <smoser> as usually i blame smb for that ;)

 16:53:19 <smb> heh :)

 16:53:20 <Daviey> Aww, meanie

 16:53:21 <smoser> ARM!

 16:53:24 <smoser> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:53:57 <Daviey> rbasak: have you fixed ARM?

 16:54:02 <smoser> i have some stuff to fill in here if rbasak does not type in 3

 16:54:03 <smoser> 2

 16:54:06 <smoser> 1

 16:54:18 <smoser> it looks like we're going to move the cloud-images output for arm from armel to armhf.

 16:54:27 * justinlw yay

 16:54:30 <jamespage> \o/

 16:54:31 <Daviey> smoser: seems to make sense to me

 16:54:38 <rbasak> Sorry, pee break

 16:54:39 <Daviey> utlemming: ?

 16:54:45 <smoser> as, other than oracle's jvm, nothing really needs soft float

 16:54:56 <rbasak> Yeah, it's fixed. You do mean my panda, right? :)

 16:55:00 <smoser> and rbasak claims that we can potentially still support that with multi-arch

 16:55:08 <Daviey> smoser: hmm, oracle's jvm doesn't work with armel?

 16:55:16 <Daviey> err, armhf

 16:55:16 <smoser> only with armel

 16:55:19 <jamespage> not yet

 16:55:40 <Daviey> that is suck.

 16:55:46 <utlemming> robie had some thoughts about multi-arch there

 16:55:54 <Daviey> ok

 16:55:55 <rbasak> In that it should in theory work

 16:56:08 <smoser> theories are always nice to have

 16:56:08 <utlemming> but its not tested

 16:56:20 <smoser> anything else?

 16:56:22 <jamespage> speaking of java on arm; openjdk on precise has now switched back to the zero JVM with the thumb2 intepreter

 16:56:24 <rbasak> But it looks like armhf (gnueabihf) will be the ARM server standard

 16:56:26 <smoser> darn

 16:56:29 <rbasak> So Oracle would be crazy to not support it.

 16:56:33 <Daviey> lets progress, seems in hand.

 16:56:45 <smoser> [TOPIC] Open Discussion

 16:56:46 <jamespage> it passes the Java TCK so if currently the best we have in archive
