 12:04:30 <cyphermox> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:04:30 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Oct 24 12:04:30 2012 UTC.  The chair is cyphermox. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 12:04:46 <cyphermox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for October 24, 2012. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:05:01 <cyphermox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:05:09 <cyphermox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:05:17 <cyphermox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:05:27 <cyphermox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:05:40 <cyphermox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:06:01 <cyphermox> #voters cyphermox head_victim IdleOne destine

 12:06:11 <cyphermox> Now, without any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:06:15 <cyphermox> (just a second

 12:06:17 <IdleOne> Morning :P

 12:06:21 <IdleOne> :)

 12:06:48 <cyphermox> #subtopic Marta Vuelma (mvuelma )

 12:08:32 <cyphermox> mvuelma: are you around? (sorry if you're busy typing :)

 12:08:43 <mvuelma> Hello to all.

 12:08:55 <cyphermox> Hi!

 12:09:08 <mvuelma> May I start introducing myself?

 12:09:13 <cyphermox> of course :)

 12:09:17 <head_victim> Evening mvuelma :)

 12:09:20 <mvuelma> Well, let's go.

 12:10:03 <mvuelma> I live in Brazil and I started working with Linux in 2001. In 2010 I started my activities with Ubuntu community.

 12:11:22 <mvuelma> Desde esta data tenho participado de diversas formas na comunidade.

 12:11:32 <mvuelma> Since this date I have participated in various ways in the community.

 12:11:46 <mvuelma> Sorry, I wrote last words in Portuguese.

 12:12:17 <head_victim> That's ok, I've had whole IRC conversations via google translate before

 12:13:05 <mvuelma> I have done several events in various locations in the country. Lectures, courses.

 12:13:05 <head_victim> So I see you have some good testimonials, do you have any links showing you in action with the events, lectures and training?

 12:13:31 <IdleOne> https://launchpad.net/~mvuelma

 12:13:43 <IdleOne> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MartaVuelma

 12:14:11 <mvuelma> Participate actively in supporting the user community and was chosen LoCoTeam Leader in my region.

 12:14:57 <cyphermox> #link https://launchpad.net/~mvuelma

 12:15:03 <cyphermox> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MartaVuelma

 12:15:09 <mvuelma> Well, I think you may check more detailed information in my wiki.

 12:15:19 <cyphermox> (just making sure meetingology sees the links)

 12:16:20 <mvuelma> That's it!

 12:16:44 <IdleOne> mvuelma: can you tell us a bit more about ubuntu-br-rs ?

 12:17:03 <mvuelma> IdleOne, of course.

 12:17:49 <mvuelma> Here in Brazil, some LoCo Teams were inactive.

 12:18:24 <IdleOne> ah, ok so it is a sub-loco team of the -br loco?

 12:18:30 <mvuelma> It was the case of ubuntu-br-rs.

 12:19:00 <mvuelma> Yes, we are a sub-loco.

 12:19:27 <IdleOne> has the -rs team held any events?

 12:20:08 <mvuelma> As I have been promoting a series of events since last year here in my region, we change the vision of our group and we have several new members.

 12:20:47 <mvuelma> Right now, we are an active group again.

 12:21:32 <mvuelma> and we already have a schedule of events and activities for next year

 12:21:42 <IdleOne> link please

 12:22:18 <mvuelma> Sorry, not published yet.

 12:22:51 <IdleOne> what about past events, any blog posts you can link?

 12:22:52 <head_victim> Can you explain the events you've run recently and your involvement in them. We're trying to get a feel for the size and the content of them.

 12:23:17 <cyphermox> there are some posts on the mailing list for ubuntu-br-rs; I'm trying to read it with my limited understanding of portugese :)

 12:23:20 <cyphermox> #link https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-br-rs/

 12:23:24 <mvuelma> May this link be in Portuguese?

 12:23:32 <cyphermox> mvuelma: of course

 12:24:15 <head_victim> I love chromium's google translate stuff, makes multi lingual issues disappear. Until it doesn't quite get it right.

 12:25:24 <mvuelma> This event occurs every year in my region, and this year was led entirely by me: http://www.ubuntubrsc.com/grupo-de-usuarios-do-ubuntu-br-marcou-presenca-no-fisl-13.html

 12:25:55 <destine> head_victim, nice to have learned spanish, which makes Portuguese easier.

 12:26:20 <head_victim> Ah I'm boring, english only here (even then some say I've barely conquered that)

 12:26:30 <mvuelma> It's the largest free software event in Latin America and was attended by over 7000 participants.

 12:26:35 <licio> Marta is a key member of ubuntu-br community, she has been supporting the team on the major conferences in Brazil

 12:27:19 <head_victim> licio: thanks for that

 12:27:26 <head_victim> mvuelma: reading the link now, seems perfect :)

 12:27:49 <IdleOne> Anybody else here to cheer for mvuelma ?

 12:27:53 <mvuelma> head_victim, thank you.

 12:27:55 <IdleOne> Now is the time folks :)

 12:28:30 <licio> Also, the guys from ubuntu-br-sc have a hangout on air every friday and she and Ursinha are always there to answers public questions ;)

 12:29:04 <licio> IdleOne, bad brazilian time :/ 10am. some are sleeping and the rest are working :(

 12:29:26 <head_victim> mvuelma: thanks for that link, are there any more? (Just asking, I like reading about what other locos are doing)

 12:30:26 <mvuelma> head_victim, yes, you may check this one: http://martavuelma.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/balanco-do-flisol-2012/

 12:30:27 <licio> head_victim, more in the plus page https://plus.google.com/+Ubuntu-BR-SC/posts

 12:31:02 <mvuelma> Flisol is a "Install Fest" event.

 12:31:28 <mvuelma> held in several cities in Latin America simultaneously

 12:31:51 <head_victim> I ran one here last year but was only able to get 20 or so along, your photos put that to shame.

 12:35:08 <mvuelma> I am very happy with this recognition.

 12:35:27 <mvuelma> cyphermox, I'll do that.

 12:35:29 <head_victim> mvuelma: good work doing what you have, the challenge is to keep it going into the future :)

 12:35:59 <mvuelma> head_victim, certainly, this is the challenge

 12:36:28 <mvuelma> head_victim, and let's make this challenge a reality

 12:36:56 <cyphermox> I don't think we have other applicants, so unless there is other business to discuss, I'll end the meeting.

 12:37:19 <head_victim> cyphermox: none other listed on the wiki

 12:37:25 <cyphermox> great!

 12:37:26 <head_victim> Should we formalise the mailing list conversation abotu going to monthly?

 12:37:35 <tiagoscd> mvuelma is making a great job at brazilian community

 12:37:38 <cyphermox> there was such a conversation?

 12:37:51 * cyphermox fails at reading email

 12:38:00 <head_victim> Perhaps it was in the channel

 12:38:01 <head_victim> Hmm

 12:38:12 <head_victim> tiagoscd: yes, she is doing great work

 12:38:31 <cyphermox> well, if it was on IRC, we should definitely take it to the mailing list and make sure the CC knows about it, at least

 12:38:41 <tiagoscd> head_victim, I'm sad because I've no time to make a testimonial for her

 12:39:00 <cyphermox> tiagoscd: chiming in here is just as good :)

 12:39:04 <licio> mvuelma, congrats! well deserved!

 12:39:08 <head_victim> tiagoscd: don't be sad, her application was successful!

 12:39:26 <mvuelma> licio, thank you so much!
