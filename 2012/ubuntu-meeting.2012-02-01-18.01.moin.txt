 18:19:02 <bdmurray> bkerensa: I've been meaning to test that, thanks for bringing it up

 18:19:32 <bkerensa> It isn't a terribly bad bug but if a install stalls it could help for troubleshooting purposes to see where its stalling

 18:21:32 <bkerensa> excellent

 18:23:03 <bdmurray> Oh there are quite a few merge proposals for the bug patterns bzr branch if anyone wants to help review them

 18:23:39 <bkerensa> bdmurray: I plan on re-applying for control in the coming weeks so I can do a little more then triage
