 16:04:38 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Lightning round

 16:04:47 <slangasek> $ echo $(shuf -e barry doko stgraber jodh ev bdmurray slangasek ogra infinity)

 16:04:50 <slangasek> infinity barry stgraber ogra bdmurray slangasek doko jodh ev

 16:04:58 <slangasek> infinity: looks like you get to go first for your first Foundations meeting :)

 16:05:11 <infinity> Fiiiine.

 16:05:13 <doko> ohh man, this list is long ...

 16:05:14 <infinity> Worked on this week: - cdimage and debian-cd tweaks for ARM images and kubuntu-active - helped with general release management and queue management - filed tickets with IS for buildd precise upgrades - looked at fpc on armhf a bit more

 16:05:18 <infinity> Upcoming work: - need to chase down status of gnat on armhf with Linaro - more work on livefs-in-soyuz (rewriting from memory) - need to find time to debug the root cause of the qtwebkit-source FTBFS - finish the fpc on armhf port - dodge doko's attempts to dump the entire C toolchain on me - possibility of a (short) emergency VAC for personal reasons

 16:05:23 <infinity> Gah.

 16:05:26 <infinity> irrsi, damn you and your hatred of leading whitespace.

 16:05:44 <infinity> irssi, too.

 16:05:48 <infinity> Let's try that harder.

 16:05:50 <infinity> Worked on this week:

 16:05:51 <infinity> - cdimage and debian-cd tweaks for ARM images and kubuntu-active

 16:05:51 <infinity> - helped with general release management and queue management

 16:05:51 <infinity> - filed tickets with IS for buildd precise upgrades

 16:05:53 <infinity> - looked at fpc on armhf a bit more

 16:05:56 <infinity> Upcoming work:

 16:05:58 <infinity> - need to chase down status of gnat on armhf with Linaro

 16:06:00 <infinity> - more work on livefs-in-soyuz (rewriting from memory)

 16:06:03 <infinity> - need to find time to debug the root cause of the qtwebkit-source FTBFS

 16:06:05 <infinity> - finish the fpc on armhf port

 16:06:08 <infinity> - dodge doko's attempts to dump the entire C toolchain on me

 16:06:11 <infinity> - possibility of a (short) emergency VAC for personal reasons

 16:06:13 <infinity> There.

 16:06:30 <doko> infinity, qtwebkit ... this is the linker needing too much memory, afaics

 16:06:41 <infinity> doko: Yes, but why?

 16:07:05 <doko> because it's an insane amount of code?

 16:07:15 <infinity> doko: It's the same amount of code on other arches. :P

 16:07:27 <slangasek> it was running out of memory on other arches too, before tweaking?

 16:07:31 <infinity> doko: Including armel, which doesn't have the issue.

 16:07:47 <doko> infinity, yes, and webkit ftbfs on powerpc for the same reason

 16:07:56 <infinity> So, I dunno.  We'll see.  Maybe it can just be tweaked a bit, or maybe the linker on armhf is doing something dumb.

 16:08:42 <barry> infinity: all done?

 16:08:49 <infinity> barry: Go nuts.

 16:09:03 * barry can't go where he already is, but...

 16:09:09 <infinity> Go nutser.

 16:09:11 <barry> bugs investigated, fixed, sponsored: bug 903126 (smc ftbfs), bug 903121 (crystalspace ftbfs), bug 27520 (cron multiple SRUs), bug 828731 (kexec-tools multiple SRUs), bug 848915 (update-manager without $DISPLAY), bug 556293 (apt global proxy), bug 942408 (python-support not cleaning up after upgrade).  Sync'd wadllib 1.3.0-1.  Also worked on Python issue 13703 (hash collision security issue) and Python 2.6.8rc1 released.  To do: +1maint,

 16:11:02 <slangasek> barry: I assigned you a couple of triaged bugs on update-manager that looked like easy wins; do you think you could get to those this week?

 16:11:17 <infinity> doko: Only due to a broken .symbols file.

 16:11:18 <barry> slangasek: yep, their on my list for this week

 16:11:20 <infinity> doko: The link succeeds.

 16:11:22 <slangasek> cheers

 16:11:41 <jodh> Worked on fix for bug 940290 (updating tests atm...) Investigating bug

 16:11:41 <jodh> 883618 - looks like "something" is calling an xdg-* command or possibly

 16:11:41 <jodh> /usr/share/acpi-support/screenblank, but tricky to pin this down due to

 16:11:41 <jodh> the time taken to perform the upgrade. Wishing we had opengrok to help

 16:11:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 940290 in upstart "console log consumes fds upon job restart/respawn" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/940290

 16:13:47 <ogra_> jodh, is serial console support still on your list ?

 16:13:57 <ogra_> done:

 16:13:57 <ogra_> * started researching why ubiquity kde bits end up on ac100 images

 16:13:57 <ogra_> * look into bug #924018 (Preseeding doesn't work with oem-config) ... made sure preseed values get applied at all, now on to why oem-config doesnt pick up

 16:13:57 <ogra_> * tried to spend a little time with bug #747229 (screen color change when oem-config-remove runs in serial consoles)

 16:13:58 <ogra_> * closed a handfull of bugs in the "rotting ubuntu-arm bugs" list, ongoing process

 16:14:00 <ogra_> * started researching why the keyboard selection gets completely skipped in oem-config in some preinstalled images (bug #925482)

 16:14:14 <ogra_> * look across the armel ftbfs list

 16:14:16 <ogra_> ..

 16:14:36 <infinity> ogra_: Which kde bits?

 16:14:59 <ogra_> infinity, well, ubiquity-frontend-kde and all its deps end up on the ac100 images

 16:15:34 <ogra_> not sure why ... but its pretty visible since akonadi is the first app in the unity app lens now :P

 16:15:49 <ogra_> they also dont get removed

 16:15:51 <ogra_> ..

 16:16:09 <ogra_> you sure ?

 16:16:13 <infinity> *nod*

 16:16:17 <bdmurray> modifications to the bug pattern for bug 541595 to avoid incorrect dupication

 16:16:18 <jodh> ogra_: it's in there somewhere. I'll see if I can sift it slightly

 16:16:18 <jodh> closer to the surface.

 16:17:02 <bdmurray> ␗

 16:17:07 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm, is there more than one "already installed and configured" bug, or was the bug pattern duping things that were altogether unrelated?

 16:17:36 <doko> infinity, both the bfd and the gold linker fail to link this

 16:17:36 <bdmurray> slangasek: no, not altogether unrelated - just a bit overzealous

 16:18:01 <bdmurray> slangasek: it was a small number of incorrect dupes and I fixed the most recent ones

 16:18:09 <slangasek> ok

 16:18:15 <infinity> doko: Ahh, I hadn't tested with gold yet (though I note that the build is attempting to use gold and failing to do so... Do we not carry the --with-ld GCC patch?)

 16:19:02 <doko> infinity, use -B/usr/lib/gold-ld to use gold

 16:19:13 <doko> /usr/bin/ld: fatal error: libQtWebKit.so.4.9.0: mmap: failed to allocate 4275704736 bytes for output file: Cannot allocate memory

 16:21:09 <bdmurray> slangasek: that's for later!  the hottest bug is twice as hot as the 2nd hottest and we should sort it out

 16:21:10 <slangasek> (done)

 16:21:32 <infinity> ogra_: Definitely my bug.  Fixing.

 16:22:27 * slangasek eyes the snow

 16:23:35 * infinity doesn't see anyone named adconrad.

 16:23:56 <slangasek> heh

 16:24:24 <slangasek> and jodh went and ev is on the list but is at conference today

 16:24:26 <doko> that's a fake dump so that you are not prepared for the real one ;-P

 16:24:48 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugz

 16:25:38 <bdmurray> so our hottest bug is bug 659438

 16:25:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 659438 in apt (Ubuntu) "Installation/Removal fails because of package which could not be located (failure in apt.Cache.required_download)" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/659438

 16:26:19 <bdmurray> I believe there is some bug status confusion on it

 16:26:21 <infinity> bdmurray: And if it didn't OOPS LP, we could look at it.

 16:26:34 <slangasek> it worked for me

 16:26:49 <infinity> Three timeouts in a row for me.

 16:26:52 <infinity> Oh well.

 16:26:56 <bdmurray> use +text

 16:27:02 <bdmurray> if you want the gist of it

 16:27:11 <infinity> Ahh, it just rendered on the fourth go.

 16:27:32 <ogra_> hmm, some dupes there

 16:28:09 <bdmurray> only dupe 903269 has apport data and is from precise

 16:28:56 <slangasek> I wonder if we should just set that as the master bug

 16:30:52 <bdmurray> It might also be that its the same traceback but a different bug

 16:31:04 <slangasek> could be

 16:31:33 <infinity> ogra_: (Fix committed and uploaded, BTW)

 16:31:47 <ogra_> merci !

 16:31:58 * ogra_ strikes it off his todo

 16:32:10 <slangasek> bdmurray: followed up on the bug and dropped the "fix committed"

 16:32:17 <slangasek> er no

 16:32:22 <slangasek> attempted to, but now I've hit an lp timeout ;)

 16:32:43 <slangasek> bdmurray: I'll try to follow up on that asynchronously then.  what else do you have for bugs?

 16:33:25 <slangasek> ok that's way too much white stuff falling from the sky

 16:33:26 <bdmurray> bug 941922 - I couldn't decide how important that should be

 16:33:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 941922 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "do-release-upgrade races puppet for file contents" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/941922

 16:34:23 <slangasek> bdmurray: hmm, I'd say medium at most

 16:35:02 <slangasek> seems like people using puppet should be disabling it during a dist-upgrade, no?

 16:35:17 <infinity> I'm inclined to say that automagic configuration management and package managers just plain can't run concurrently.

 16:35:35 <stgraber> the definitely should turn off puppet or any other configuration management tool during upgrade

 16:35:44 <stgraber> *they

 16:35:47 <infinity> Not sure if that's something that should be fixed in apt/dpkg/rpm/etc/etc, or just in puppet (or in the minds of admins)

 16:35:54 <mvo> bdmurray: about #659438> do the reproduce steps actually work?

 16:36:31 <bdmurray> mvo: the test case in that?  I haven't tried that yet but can today.

 16:36:45 <ogra_> stgraber, well, as ugly as it is, then there should probably a debconf note telling them

 16:36:45 <mvo> we *could* turn off pupett automatically before the upgrade if that is something that people want, I'm just not sure that this is uncontroversial

 16:37:24 <mvo> bdmurray: that would be great, TBH the instruction does not look correct to me but I may be wrong about it

 16:37:29 <ogra_> (like we do on libc upgrades)

 16:37:34 <infinity> mvo: Sure, you could do it in a high level tool like update-manager, but that still feels like it's broken for low-level package management.

 16:37:49 * mvo nods at infinity

 16:38:03 <infinity> mvo: Maybe what this really wants is puppet shipping an apt-utils hook that turns itself off and on.

 16:38:15 <slangasek> that sounds sane to me

 16:38:15 <infinity> mvo: Still doesn't cover the dpkg case, but it covers most everything else.

 16:38:57 <mvo> infinity: good point, that sounds like the best way forward, dpkg::{pre,post}-invoke

 16:39:05 * infinity nods.

 16:39:27 <slangasek> so we can reassign it to puppet and let the server team decide the severity? :)

 16:39:30 <infinity> And a dependency on apt-utils, so it works.  (or is apt-utils no longer required for dpkg::-invoke hooks?)

 16:39:56 <mvo> the invoke hooks should work without apt-utils

 16:40:00 <infinity> Oh, shiny.

 16:40:05 <infinity> Even better, then.

 16:40:17 <infinity> Feels like the cleanest solution to me, short of doing it at the dpkg level.

 16:40:21 * mvo tries to think of a reason why it wouldn't but fails and gets more tea to keep the engine running

 16:40:28 <slangasek> mvo, infinity: one of you want to reassign to puppet with that explanation?

 16:40:35 <jodh> What about the case where an admin runs do-release-upgrade by

 16:40:36 <jodh> mistake? Wouldn't it be better to have the command print a warning an

 16:40:36 <jodh> exit until admins intervene to manually switch off puppet/cfengine/bcfg2/etc?

 16:40:36 <jodh> 

 16:40:45 <jodh> s/an/and/

 16:41:08 <slangasek> jodh: if you run "do-release-upgrade" by mistake, you get to keep both pieces

 16:41:28 <infinity> jodh: Well, with the apt hook solution, there's no real need for warning.  puppet just gets disabled (and re-enabled) every time apt runs.

 16:41:28 <slangasek> we're not responsible for our users hiring minimally competent sysadmins ;)

 16:41:31 <mvo> jodh: if we go with the suggestion from infinity that would be fine because puttet would shutdown when dpkg is invoked by apt which it should. and if at this point it was still a mistake there are more problems :)

 16:42:34 <infinity> slangasek: I can follow up on the bug post-meeting, since mvo seems to have remained silent. :P

 16:42:41 <slangasek> infinity: thanks :-)

 16:42:52 <mvo> infinity: I was about to say that I can do it but you deserve credit for the plan so … ;)

 16:43:00 <slangasek> bdmurray: any more?

 16:43:13 <jodh> If a system is being managed by puppet, is it ever valid to run

 16:43:13 <jodh> do-release-upgrade though?

 16:43:13 <jodh> 

 16:43:25 <bdmurray> bug 942030

 16:43:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 942030 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "'Take a photo' preview pane not showing live preview" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/942030

 16:43:55 <infinity> jodh: Sure.

 16:44:33 <infinity> jodh: d-r-u is just a flimsy wrapper around apt.  In the best case (ie: if we don't have horrible bugs we're hiding and working around in update-manager), it literally does nothing but install and remove packages. :P

 16:44:38 <stgraber> bdmurray: I guess I'll take that one once I'm done with the keyboard stuff then, will need to figure out a way to expose a webcam to kvm ;)

 16:44:52 <infinity> jodh: And if "running apt" is an invalid thing for puppet users to do, there's a problem.

 16:44:52 <bdmurray> heh

 16:45:38 <bdmurray> that's all then

 16:47:55 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Patch piloting

 16:48:01 <slangasek> just as dholbach leaves ;)

 16:48:13 <barry> :)

 16:48:27 <infinity> Well timed.

 16:48:43 <infinity> I know I missed my last pilot session due to connectivity issues while I was at Connect. :/

 16:49:00 <slangasek> just to reiterate... we need to make sure patch piloting is happening, to keep contributions flowing in

 16:49:09 <slangasek> our track record on this has not been great

 16:49:43 <slangasek> if circumstances prevent you from piloting on your assigned day (because it overlaps with a conference for example), by all means swap days

 16:50:04 <slangasek> doko: looks like you're scheduled to patch pilot tomorrow - is that going to work ok?

 16:50:21 <doko> urgh

 16:50:32 <doko> yeah, will try to start early

 16:51:02 <bdmurray> regarding patches I also wanted to mention https://bugs.launchpad.net/~foundations-bugs/+patches

 16:53:01 <slangasek> bdmurray: do you know if that list is going up/down?

 16:54:18 <bdmurray> slangasek: I would guess up but don't have numbers right in front of me

 16:54:31 <slangasek> that's a good list of bugs for folks to draw on as well when patch piloting, anyway - probably a lot of these (particularly the older ones) should have the patch tag dropped because they don't really fix the bug

 16:54:49 <slangasek> maybe stgraber wants to review the patch in bug #20420 :)

 16:54:51 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 20420 in netcfg (Ubuntu) "default to wired network interface if connected" [Wishlist,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/20420

 16:55:34 <slangasek> any other concerns on patch piloting?

 16:55:49 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:55:57 <slangasek> or other business?

 16:56:24 <slangasek> #endmeeting
