 18:14:31 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:14:41 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:15:21 <jdstrand> so, I spent a *lot* of time on webkit and kde/archive admin stuff last week

 18:15:49 <jdstrand> the former is mostly done, but I need to follow up with some discussions, etc

 18:16:14 <jdstrand> the latter is done for now. There is more that can be done, but I don't have the stamina to do it atm

 18:16:28 <ScottK> :-)

 18:16:47 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place

 18:17:15 <jdstrand> I have a couple of MIR audits left, then after that, recruiting and back to pending updates

 18:17:25 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 18:17:40 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 18:17:44 <mdeslaur> just published the nvidia driver updates

 18:17:59 <mdeslaur> and now I'm looking at koffice and uhm...

 18:18:02 <mdeslaur> what's it called

 18:18:03 <mdeslaur> calligra?

 18:18:18 <mdeslaur> tomorrow, I'll be working on openoffice and libreoffice

 18:18:23 <mdeslaur> and will try and get to libxml too

 18:18:26 <mdeslaur> that's it for me

 18:18:33 <mdeslaur> tyhicks: you're up

 18:18:43 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: thanks again for working on that mvidia issue

 18:18:47 <jdstrand> nvidia

 18:19:01 * micahg wonders where he went

 18:19:01 <mdeslaur> np

 18:19:07 <tyhicks> micahg: go ahead

 18:19:21 <mdeslaur> hehe, I wasn't sure who was usually after steve

 18:19:35 <mdeslaur> sorry for aggravating your OCD :)

 18:19:45 * jdstrand allows goes with longevity on team

 18:19:52 <micahg> I'm still working on webkit, hopefully will see the light at the end of the tunnel soon, I'm also SRUing a regression fix from the icedtea-web in natty/oneiric for sbeattie

 18:19:56 <jdstrand> that is the only way I can keep it straight :)

 18:20:18 <micahg> as well as the standard mozilla pretesting of the week

 18:20:41 <micahg> I think that's it for me

 18:20:57 <tyhicks> I'm covering triage this week for steve

 18:21:33 <tyhicks> My focus will be on updates and working a new eCryptfs data corruption bug

 18:22:01 <jdstrand> :\ how widespread is that?

 18:22:08 <tyhicks> It is intermittent and only happens when downloading really large files, so it will be a fun one :/

 18:22:22 <ScottK> How large is really large?

 18:22:35 <tyhicks> ScottK: I've only reproduced it with > 3G files

 18:22:47 <ScottK> OK.

 18:22:48 <tyhicks> jdstrand: Not too widespread. I've only seen one report on it.

 18:23:02 <ScottK> The concerned eCryptfs user sits back down.

 18:23:13 <tyhicks> It is very subtle, too. Only one or two bytes changed in the corrupted file.

 18:23:23 <tyhicks> (at least in the couple times that I was able to reproduce it)

 18:23:39 <kirkland> tyhicks: what bug # is that?

 18:23:43 * tyhicks looks

 18:23:52 <jdstrand> tyhicks: let's talk outside of the meeting on how you are reproducing

 18:24:22 <tyhicks> bug 1027450

 18:24:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1027450 in eCryptfs "File corruption in ecryptfs folder" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1027450

 18:24:24 <tyhicks> jdstrand: ack

 18:24:40 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 18:25:41 <jdstrand> jjohansen: you're up

 18:25:42 <jjohansen> I guess I'm up

 18:25:43 <jjohansen> I've got a couple of apparmor bugs to look into, cboltz's profile cache failing reported on the ml, and a no new privs issue from hallyn,

 18:25:43 <jjohansen> While I am at the no new privs issue, I'll also look into how to deal with that in stacking, it may require us to carry some information in the stack

 18:25:43 <jjohansen> I've got a qrt kernel security failure to finishing looking into

 18:25:43 <jjohansen> beyond that I'll be pushing out the 3rd iteration of the current patchset with the locking rework, and might include some of the perm remapping, profile hashing and stacking patches with it

 18:26:41 <jjohansen> jdstrand: back to you

 18:27:23 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:27:59 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 18:28:05 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 18:28:11 <jdstrand> I pasted the highlighted packages above

 18:28:19 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 18:28:30 <jdstrand> There are a lot of merge opportunities for packages listed in http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/. Performing these updates is a great way to help Ubuntu and bolster your developer application.

 18:28:39 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 18:28:47 <ScottK> \o

 18:28:53 <jdstrand> ScottK: go ahead

 18:29:06 <ScottK> The Calligra/KOffice issue is in an embedded copy of wv2.

 18:29:23 <ScottK> We also have a packaged wv2 that's significantly older.

 18:29:43 <ScottK> The code in the area of the fix is superficially similar, but the package doesn't build with the patch.

 18:30:13 <ScottK> I was wondering if when you're looking at Calligra/KOffice you might have a glance at wv2 and see if you think it's also relevant to it.

 18:30:15 <ScottK> ..

 18:30:33 <mdeslaur> it did look relevant at first glance

 18:30:55 <ScottK> (I was in a rush on saturday and heaved an updated wv2 at quantal.

 18:31:03 <ScottK> It FTBFS.

 18:31:18 <micahg> scottK: that looks like a gcc-4.7 failure

 18:31:41 <ScottK> OK.

 18:31:46 <ScottK> Thanks.

 18:31:54 <ScottK> I'll see if I can find someone to help me with it.

 18:32:16 <ScottK> (that or remove the package, there aren't any users for the lib and it's dead upstream other than the embedded on in Calligra.

 18:33:56 <jdstrand> ScottK: thanks

 18:34:03 <jdstrand> any other questions or items to discuss?

 18:38:03 <jdstrand> mdeslaur, micahg, tyhicks, jjohansen, ScottK: thanks!
