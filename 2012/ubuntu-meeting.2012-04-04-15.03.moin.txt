 15:09:09 <slangasek> sorry, was digesting the above :)

 15:09:14 <slangasek> * ongoing work around partner repo

 15:09:14 <slangasek> * did some work over the weekend looking into cross-buildability of the base system; applied some fixes, including some to apt

 15:09:17 <slangasek> * preparing an apt upload for a few issues (bug #924628, bug #968828, et al)

 15:10:54 <jodh> * Working on Plymouth SIGSEGV bug (553745 - 270 duplicates!)

 15:10:54 <jodh> We can now recreate the problem, which is the first step to

 15:10:57 <jodh> understanding it. Still proving difficult to track down what is

 15:10:59 <jodh> causing the corruption, but it appears to be related to the script plugin.

 15:11:02 <jodh> * Updated wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Plymouth

 15:11:09 <jodh> 

 15:11:48 <slangasek> no barry or infinity today

 15:11:48 <slangasek> doko:

 15:12:06 <doko> - bug triage (python2.7)

 15:12:06 <doko> - bug fix uploads for python2.7, gcc-4.7, mpfr4, pcsc-lite, bash, gccgo

 15:12:06 <doko> - started test rebuild, fortunately amoog did file the reports

 15:12:06 <doko> - analyzed and filed gcc-4.7 build failures (debian). http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=ftbfs-gcc-4.7;users=debian-gcc@lists.debian.org

 15:12:06 <doko> - self appraisal

 15:12:08 <doko> - reproduce build failures with GCC Linaro

 15:12:51 <ev> want a taste:

 15:12:52 <ev> https://rt.admin.canonical.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=48667#txn-862810

 15:12:54 <ev> - Discussed Cassandra backup strategies with James.

 15:12:55 <ev> - The crash database is finally completely live as of April 2nd. Due to a

 15:12:56 <ev> deployment bug, up until a few days ago it wasn't handling core file

 15:12:57 <ev> submissions, and thus was not bucketing binary crashes.

 15:12:59 <ev> - Cowboyed a few fixes to the production retracer with the IS team.

 15:12:59 <ev> - Working on a Django and d3.js (do check it out d3, it's awesome) web

 15:13:01 <ev> application for crash database statistics.

 15:13:02 <ev> - Working with IS to continue the deployment of the crash database components,

 15:13:02 <ev> better handle retracer overload.

 15:13:04 <ev> - Suggestions welcome on ways to improve apport-retrace performance. We're

 15:13:05 <ev> going to have something watching the Rabbit queue, and using a RED-like

 15:13:06 <ev> algorithm:

 15:13:07 <slangasek> doko: pcsc-lite> did you do rebuild tests of the revdeps? :)

 15:13:07 <ev> http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.adv-qdisc.red.html

 15:13:08 <ev> not accepting some core file submissions until things quiet back down.

 15:13:10 <ev> - Worked with Matthew to review his mock up of the design for the statistics

 15:13:10 <ev> website.

 15:13:12 <ev> - Reviewed the installation and upgrade pages of the 12.04 website for the

 15:13:13 <ev> web team.

 15:13:15 <ev> - We saw 1505 unique problems (buckets) yesterday (and *many* instances of

 15:13:16 <ev> those problems).

 15:13:18 <ev> - 0 new whoopsie bugs. Please keep an eye on that process on your systems and

 15:13:19 <ev> do let me know if it gets out of hand.

 15:13:19 <ev> (done)

 15:14:01 <doko> slangasek, no =-/

 15:14:14 <doko> adding to my list

 15:14:18 <stgraber> - ISO tracker

 15:14:18 <stgraber> - Worked on a series of bugfixes that are now applied to http://iso.qa.dev.stgraber.org

 15:14:21 <stgraber> - Wrote a python module to access the tracker API, works with python2 and python3 and is

 15:14:24 <stgraber> fully tested. This will be the recommended way to access the API.

 15:14:26 <stgraber> lp:~ubuntu-qa-website-devel/ubuntu-qa-website/python-qatracker

 15:14:29 <stgraber> - Updating API documentation on the website now, will then ask IS to update production.

 15:14:32 <stgraber> - Containers

 15:14:34 <stgraber> - Some more LXC testing and fixes for per-container apparmor profile and making sure

 15:14:37 <stgraber> we don't get actions weirdly denied by apparmor. Looks like we caught them all finally.

 15:14:40 <stgraber> - Networking

 15:14:43 <stgraber> - Uploaded a new ifupdown cleaning up /etc/network/interfaces on systems that go invalid

 15:14:46 <stgraber> dns-nameservers entries from netcfg. Also fixes the broadcast address on systems with

 15:14:49 <stgraber> static config.

 15:14:51 <stgraber> - Updated regexp in resolvconf to match multiple entries in dns-nameservers

 15:14:54 <stgraber> - Installer

 15:14:57 <stgraber> - One minor ubiquity-dm fix for ubuntu studio

 15:14:57 <slangasek> doko: could you please check that, at *least* for main? (freerdp/wpasupplicant)  since this change is landing past your own autobuild test ;)

 15:14:59 <stgraber> - Partner archive

 15:15:02 <stgraber> - Did some packaging and tests

 15:15:04 <stgraber> - Synced libva from Debian to have it multi-arched, fixed two FTBFS caused by the new libva

 15:15:07 <stgraber> - Made zenity multi-arch:foreign which should allow vmware-view-client to be installed on amd64

 15:15:10 <stgraber> - Other

 15:15:18 <stgraber> - Released and uploaded the final (I hope) LTSP for 12.04, 5.3.7

 15:15:20 <stgraber> - Fixed all the bugs discovered during ISO testing for Edubuntu

 15:15:23 <doko> slangasek, will do

 15:15:23 <stgraber> - Fixed an annoying bug in irssi (alt-backspace not working)

 15:15:25 <stgraber> - Performance review

 15:15:28 <stgraber> - Vacation and timezone change

 15:15:30 <stgraber> - I'll be off on Friday (6th) and Monday (9th)

 15:15:33 <stgraber> - I'll then be working from Europe (CEST) until the 29th

 15:15:35 <stgraber> - TODO this week (today/tomorrow)

 15:15:36 <slangasek> thanks

 15:15:38 <stgraber> - Test current ISO tracker and file RT ticket for update of production

 15:15:40 <stgraber> - Look at bug 873468

 15:15:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 873468 in update-manager (Ubuntu Precise) "Update to latest Release failed for overloaded mirrors with no descriptive error message" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/873468

 15:15:43 <stgraber> - Spend any remaining time on installer bugs.

 15:15:45 <stgraber> (DONE)

 15:17:41 <slangasek> any questions?

 15:18:59 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:19:29 <bdmurray> when I was looking at update-manager bugs I ran across bug 289952

 15:19:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 289952 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager rewrites sources.list to only use official mirrors" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/289952

 15:19:59 <cjwatson> there's a config knob for that, though it isn't well-documented

 15:20:02 <bdmurray> and it just seems to me that option for allowing third party sources isn't well known

 15:20:16 <slangasek> hmm, this was discussed at UDS

 15:20:29 <bdmurray> cjwatson: right, so I wonder what we can do to make it more well documented

 15:20:32 <slangasek> it was agreed we should be disabling third-party sources for the upgrade, but re-enabling them afterwards

 15:20:47 <slangasek> (but hasn't gotten done yet)

 15:21:01 <cjwatson> slangasek: that doesn't address the "faster downloads from local mirror" problem, though, so wouldn't deal with this bug

 15:21:09 <slangasek> ah

 15:22:01 <cjwatson> TBH none of update-manager's configuration is particularly documented; it probably needs somebody to go through the whole thing and write a man page or something ...

 15:22:13 <cjwatson> (also, many of its configuration options are misspelled)

 15:22:24 <slangasek> is the local mirror thing worth documenting in the release noteS?

 15:22:35 <slangasek> under "how to upgrade"

 15:22:50 <bdmurray> isn't it too late in the release cycle for updating the man page?

 15:23:16 <cjwatson> not if somebody has time to do the work

 15:23:26 <cjwatson> it may be too late to find anyone with time ;-)

 15:23:30 <cjwatson> slangasek: yes

 15:23:34 <cjwatson> (imo)

 15:23:52 <slangasek> bdmurray: can you open a task on ubuntu-release-notes for it?

 15:23:56 <cjwatson> I have a different approach locally - I have /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.d/local-mirrors.cfg with:

 15:23:59 <cjwatson> [Sources]

 15:24:01 <cjwatson> ValidMirrors=/etc/update-manager/local-mirrors

 15:24:07 <cjwatson> and /etc/update-manager/local-mirrors with:

 15:24:12 <cjwatson> http://mirror/ubuntu

 15:24:16 <cjwatson> http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

 15:24:17 <cjwatson> # etc.

 15:24:25 <bdmurray> slangasek: sure

 15:24:47 <cjwatson> that's a bit more fiddly to set up though, and I haven't actually tested it in anger for a while

 15:26:08 <bdmurray> bug 964812 is also regarding update-manager and the modifications it makes to sources.list

 15:26:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 964812 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "release upgrade failed because of missing essential package ubuntu-minimal" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/964812

 15:28:13 <slangasek> doesn't that reduce to the same issue though?

 15:28:46 <slangasek> The best I think we can do there is improve the error message

 15:30:12 * slangasek follows up to the bug with that

 15:31:37 <bdmurray> If you look at Screenlog.txt you'll see that it uses archive.ubuntu.com and de2.archive.ubuntu.com with odd comibnations

 15:31:44 <bdmurray> precise-updates/main

 15:31:52 <bdmurray> precise/multiverse

 15:32:01 <bdmurray> precise-backports/main

 15:32:05 <bdmurray> but no precise/main

 15:33:09 <slangasek> hmm

 15:33:49 <bdmurray> maybe we need their original sources.list?

 15:34:39 <slangasek> I think so

 15:35:26 <slangasek> followed up

 15:35:43 <bdmurray> okay, then in bug 965819 the reporter indicates that reiserfsprogs wasn't installed

 15:35:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 965819 in mountall (Ubuntu) "mount fail during boot-up" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/965819

 15:36:02 <cjwatson> hooray, fairly sure I've got bug 792652

 15:36:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 792652 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "ubiquity crashed with ValueError in command(): I/O operation on closed file" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/792652

 15:36:12 <stgraber> yay!

 15:36:31 <slangasek> \o/

 15:36:54 <slangasek> cjwatson: does reiserfsprogs get pulled in at install time if you format reiserfs?

 15:37:02 <cjwatson> yes, it should do; that bug is odd

 15:37:19 <slangasek> ok

 15:37:27 <slangasek> I don't think that's a high priority bug then

 15:37:44 <cjwatson> it would be if it were failing :)

 15:37:47 <cjwatson> reassigned to ubiquity and incompleted

 15:38:05 <bdmurray> slangasek: sources.list was in the clone file

 15:38:14 <slangasek> oh, oops

 15:38:40 <cjwatson> maybe fails when reusing an existing /home filesystem, although from the code I don't see why it would

 15:39:28 <bdmurray> it seems like update-manager should at least make sure main is enabled

 15:40:57 <slangasek> bdmurray: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/prerequists-sources.list seems to have the answer to the strange output

 15:41:42 <slangasek> yes, u-m *is* making sure main is enabled, by erroring out if it isn't... :)

 15:42:07 <slangasek> I don't think it would be productive for u-m to go editing the sources.list to add main to a mirror of its choice

 15:42:08 <cjwatson> prerequists> speaking of misspellings ...

 15:42:51 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay but a more descriptive error message would help here

 15:43:16 <slangasek> yes, agreed

 15:44:15 <bdmurray> those three are the only bugs I had for us

 15:44:19 <slangasek> ok

 15:45:18 <slangasek> the rls-p-tracking list has gotten longer again I see

 15:45:31 <slangasek> cjwatson: 972250, is the fix for that uploaded?  the report shows it as in-progress

 15:45:38 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/rls-p-tracking-bugs.html

 15:45:45 <slangasek> bug #972250

 15:45:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 972250 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "regression from 4k_sectors.patch: "non-sector-aligned data is found in the core file"" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/972250

 15:45:50 <cjwatson> slangasek: yes, uploaded

 15:46:00 <cjwatson> the list is a day out of date as usual

 15:46:10 <slangasek> doh

 15:47:29 <slangasek> anything on that list that looks at-risk to have for 12.04?

 15:47:48 <slangasek> i.e., please review your assigned bugs there and shout if you don't think the fix is getting in

 15:48:36 <cjwatson> I *think* all my >=High ones are still OK

 15:48:49 <stgraber> I only had a quick look at bug 772470 but not being able to reproduce (ENOWINDOWS) makes it difficult to work on

 15:48:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 772470 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "os-prober doesn't detect Windows partition but the recovery partition instead" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/772470

 15:48:58 * jodh crosses everything for bug 553745.

 15:49:00 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 553745 in plymouth (Ubuntu Maverick) "plymouthd crashed with SIGSEGV in ply_event_loop_process_pending_events()" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/553745

 15:49:16 <stgraber> so I'm happy to swap bugs with someone ;)

 15:49:41 <slangasek> stgraber: do you need windows licenses for testing?  we have those

 15:50:00 <cjwatson> the direction of http://people.canonical.com/~rspencer/rls_bugs.svg is certainly unpleasant

 15:50:09 <cjwatson> (though that's all teams)

 15:50:29 <slangasek> *someone* is gonna have to run windows to reproduce this issue, so I'm not sure swapping helps us any :)

 15:51:02 <cjwatson> I just nuked my windows install to do EFI testing; although I did keep a backup

 15:51:20 <stgraber> slangasek: yeah, I guess having a standard version of windows would help (I only have windows 8 and windows 2008 DC edition), I'm not totally sure how to reproduce the Windows part of that setup though, doesn't look like what you get with a default install

 15:51:46 <cjwatson> regarding the page title in screen reader bug, which is now assigned to me, I've asked #ubuntu-accessibility for advice on what the desired behaviour should be and am awaiting a response

 15:51:59 <slangasek> stgraber: oh right, you need a recovery partition to reproduce it, don't you :/

 15:52:09 <bdmurray> I have a dual boot system with a recovery partition (I think)

 15:52:37 <slangasek> bdmurray: want to hack on os-prober?

 15:52:59 <cjwatson> it's actually ubiquity that needs hacking, as I explained in that bug

 15:53:02 <slangasek> oh

 15:53:13 <slangasek> bdmurray: want to hack on ubiquity? :)

 15:53:15 <cjwatson> comment 5

 15:54:40 <slangasek> bdmurray: doesn't sound like it ;)  Alternatively can you get stgraber access to your machine for testing, or send him a disk image?

 15:55:27 <bdmurray> slangasek: sure, I'm happy to help

 15:55:56 <slangasek> stgraber, bdmurray: you two can sort it out from there then?

 15:56:04 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:56:18 <slangasek> anything else?
