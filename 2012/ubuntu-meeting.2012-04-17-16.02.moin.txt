 16:02:13 <arosales> should be relatively short :-)

 16:02:22 <Ursinha> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:57 <Ursinha> should I trust the wiki page?

 16:03:15 <arosales> smoser: did you update after last weeks meeting?

 16:03:43 <Ursinha> the logs aren't there..

 16:04:09 <arosales> spamaps isn't here at the moment

 16:04:32 <arosales> jamespage: did you have a chance to follow up on the FTBFS?

 16:04:43 <arosales> jamespage: is also at ODS so may not be available.

 16:04:56 <arosales> Ursinha: lets move onto bugs for now

 16:05:12 <Ursinha> all right

 16:05:20 <arosales> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:05:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 928990 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "fsck / dirty filesystem on instance is death" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/928990

 16:06:14 <arosales> utlemming: any update there?

 16:06:43 <utlemming> arosales: yes, it is going to require substaintial plumbing to get that fixed.

 16:07:00 <arosales> utlemming:ok,  as we are past final freeze is this something that will need to go into an SRU?

 16:07:11 <utlemming> Most users should never hit it, so it not as scary as it sounds

 16:07:28 <utlemming> that particular bug has been changed with a request for a rescue console

 16:07:39 <arosales> utlemming: ok, thanks.

 16:07:43 <utlemming> I've done a bit of work on it, but I want to make this a UDS discussion

 16:07:57 <arosales> utlemming: will you be drafting up a blueprint?

 16:08:11 <utlemming> Yes, its part of the cloud images roundtable I've proposed

 16:08:30 <arosales> utlemming: cool, thanks.

 16:09:19 * arosales skipping 930916 as SpamapS isn't currently available

 16:15:51 <arosales> looks like jamespage had also taken a look at that one.

 16:16:23 <arosales> MIR's are progerssing

 16:16:33 <Ursinha> arosales, he unassigned himself from that bug

 16:17:11 <arosales> Ursinha: ah yes, any takers here ?

 16:17:35 <Ursinha> it seems the package needs to be removed from the archive, if so, there might be a process somewhere indicating how to do so

 16:17:46 <Ursinha> (subscribing a team to the bug or something like that)

 16:17:53 <arosales> ya, may need to add an archieve admin

 16:17:59 <arosales> I'll follow up on it

 16:18:02 <Ursinha> cool

 16:18:06 <arosales> thats it for the bugs.

 16:18:12 <arosales> Just a few blueprints to go over

 16:18:21 * arosales looking at

 16:18:22 <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:18:24 <Ursinha> [ACTION] arosales to follow up on bug 935071

 16:18:24 * meetingology arosales to follow up on bug 935071

 16:18:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 935071 in drools (Ubuntu Precise) "Please remove drools from precise" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/935071

 16:18:37 <arosales> sorting by priority and completion

 16:18:54 <Ursinha> #topic Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:18:56 * arosales also looking at non-openstack bugs

 16:19:07 <arosales> skipping https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack-charms

 16:19:19 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-kvm-document-suggested-changes

 16:19:34 <arosales> I don't think hallyn is here

 16:19:35 <seh> I was going to start the perf runs today, but that laptop is now doing qa tests

 16:19:48 <seh> i blame arosales  :)

 16:19:59 <Ursinha> arosales, one of the ACTION items from last meeting was: SpamapS to postpone servercloud-p-cloud-power-management to Q

 16:20:15 <arosales> seh: for sure, I'll take that blame :-)

 16:20:23 <arosales> I'll follow up with hallyn

 16:20:31 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-pushing-cloud

 16:20:47 <arosales> utlemming: are these TODOs going to make 12.04?

 16:21:23 <utlemming> No, I've marked the blueprint deferred already. I'll also update the todo's

 16:21:31 <arosales> utlemming: ok, thanks

 16:21:35 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cloudutils

 16:22:03 <arosales> also may need to look at this one I think the thought on that one was to get clou-images-sync done

 16:22:19 <arosales> utlemming: is that still viable for 12.04?

 16:22:49 <utlemming> arosales: yes, the cloud-image sync script is done

 16:23:13 <arosales> utlemming: cool, should "[utlemming] implement cloud-images-sync: TODO" move to done?

 16:23:30 <utlemming> refresh. I just updated that

 16:23:49 <arosales> utlemming: ah thanks :-)

 16:24:20 <arosales> Ursinha: thats covers the blueprints I had in mind to discuss

 16:24:26 <Ursinha> arosales, right

 16:27:59 <rbasak> Nothing else to report. Any questions for me?

 16:28:25 <arosales> rbasak: can that be an SRU or do we need to talk with the release team about getting this in before 12.04 release?

 16:28:56 <rbasak> arosales: the foundations team are looking after this - infinity in particular.

 16:29:28 <arosales> rbasak: ok, I'll also follow up with the release team on Friday during their meeting
