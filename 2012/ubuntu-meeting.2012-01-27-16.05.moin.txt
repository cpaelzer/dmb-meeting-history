 16:07:34 * slangasek wonders if the bot is paying attention

 16:07:41 <slangasek> #link http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendars/ubuntu-release-calendar/ release schedule

 16:08:03 <slangasek> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/rls-p-tracking-bugs.html bugs the engineering teams have committed to fix

 16:08:28 <slangasek> if you have other bugs you'd like the engineering teams to consider for fixing, they should be assigned to specific teams so they can be found.

 16:08:38 <slangasek> Upcoming dates:

 16:08:42 <slangasek> • 2012/02/02 - Alpha 2

 16:08:46 <slangasek> • 2012/02/16 - Feature Freeze

 16:08:50 <slangasek> • 2012/02/16 - 10.04.4

 16:09:26 <cjwatson> rls-p-tracking-bugs is, as usual for reports.qa pages, hopelessly wrong

 16:09:41 <cjwatson> there are more than four bugs tagged rls-p-tracking

 16:10:07 <slangasek> oh gar

 16:10:08 <Riddell> who's incharge of alpha 2?

 16:10:14 <slangasek> Riddell: o/

 16:10:27 <Riddell> good luck :)

 16:10:50 <slangasek> hmm, thanks ;)

 16:11:26 <slangasek> [ACTION] slangasek to follow up on rls-p-tracking report breakage

 16:11:26 * meetingology` slangasek to follow up on rls-p-tracking report breakage

 16:11:51 <ogasawara> slangasek: just fyi, I've pinged bjf about it

 16:13:13 <slangasek> ***WORKITEMS:*** we are still above the overall trendline unfortunately; we really need to get workitems postponed that aren't going to happen so that other teams know what to expect.  So please work with your teams to mark as postponed work that isn't going to happen

 16:13:48 <slangasek> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ work item tracker

 16:14:12 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Alpha-2

 16:14:59 <slangasek> Alpha 2 is due next Thursday.  I'm planning for the soft freeze to go into effect Tuesday morning UTC for milestone preparation, so please plan your uploads accordingly

 16:15:36 <slangasek> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=44326&field.tag=rls-mgr-p-tracking bugs engineering teams have committed to fixing for alpha-2

 16:15:47 <slangasek> er no, sorry

 16:16:06 <slangasek> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=44326&field.tag=rls-mgr-p-tracking bugs that have been flagged by release management for fixing in alpha-2

 16:16:44 <slangasek> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=44326&field.tag=rls-p-tracking bugs engineering teams have committed to fixing that are milestoned to alpha-2

 16:17:15 <slangasek> does the latter set bear discussing in this meeting?

 16:17:36 <slangasek> if you're not expecting a fix uploaded by EOD Monday, they probably need the milestone moved

 16:18:06 <slangasek> bug #830949, bug #344878, bug #800826, bug #850264, bug #872446, bug #905754, bug #790240

 16:18:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 830949 in compiz (Ubuntu) "[Intel N10 Graphics] Need Compiz' "Copy to Texture" plugin so can display on multi-head layouts bigger than the max GL texture size" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/830949

 16:18:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 344878 in linux (Ubuntu Precise) "file name too long when creating new file (ecryptfs_lookup: lookup_one_len() returned [-36] on lower_dentry)" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/344878

 16:18:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 800826 in apparmor (Ubuntu Precise) "aa-notify doesn't display certain apparmor events" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/800826

 16:18:15 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 850264 in apt (Ubuntu Precise) "given a foreign architecture of i386 on amd64 machine, and an outdated libc, apt tries to remove libc-bin" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/850264

 16:18:15 <slangasek> (seven bugs, one with two tasks)

 16:18:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 872446 in apparmor (Ubuntu Precise) "aa-logprof should detect denials as well as complaints" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/872446

 16:19:21 <slangasek> Any comments on those bugs?

 16:19:50 <mdeslaur> I'll move the milestones on the security team ones, they won't be ready for alpha 2

 16:19:56 <slangasek> mdeslaur: ack, thanks

 16:20:08 <tyhicks> mdeslaur, slangasek: 344878 has a fix in the current precise kernel

 16:20:26 <slangasek> and I'll send out a milestone freeze pre-announcement mail today to ubuntu-devel to make sure everyone's on the same page

 16:20:29 <tyhicks> I still have to do some touchups on it, but what's currently there is "good enough"

 16:20:48 <slangasek> tyhicks: sounds like the bug tasks should either be marked as 'fix released' or have the milestone moved to track the further work

 16:21:09 <tyhicks> slangasek: ack - marking it fixed release and I'll leave it inprogress on the upstream task

 16:21:09 <slangasek> any other comments/questions on alpha-2?

 16:21:11 <mdeslaur> tyhicks: I'll mark it as fix released thanks.

 16:21:54 <tyhicks> mdeslaur: I'll fix that, too

 16:21:57 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Hardware Certification team update - mlegris or brendand

 16:22:12 <pitti> slangasek: I asked mvo about apt, and will move the compiz one (release got delayed)

 16:22:18 <mlegris> [link] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000753.html

 16:22:28 <slangasek> pitti: the apt one is pretty critical from our side and I'm working with him to get something in fwiw

 16:22:38 <mlegris> usual weekly testing, next week we'll be starting on A2

 16:22:42 <pitti> slangasek: yes, I fully agree

 16:22:42 <slangasek> (where by "working with" I mean "testing and repeatedly reporting regressions" :P)

 16:22:50 <mlegris> ..

 16:23:11 <slangasek> mlegris: thanks

 16:23:14 <slangasek> questions for mlegris?

 16:23:37 <slangasek> [TOPIC] QA team update -  jibel

 16:24:07 <jibel> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000767.html

 16:24:57 <jibel> as pitti mentioned bug 922478 is fixed but alternate is still failing with bug 922646

 16:24:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922478 in fonts-tlwg (Ubuntu) "ubuntu alternate 20120127 failed to install: ttf-thai-tlwg : Depends: fonts-thai-tlwg but it is not installable" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922478

 16:25:00 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922646 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "precise alternate LVM failed to install: no root file system" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922646

 16:25:02 <cjwatson> wut

 16:25:10 <cjwatson> I rebuilt it to fix that and tested that report.html was empty now

 16:25:12 <cjwatson> are you *sure*

 16:25:24 <cjwatson> oh sorry, misread, you mean a different bug now

 16:25:32 <pitti> jibel: well, I fixed the most probable cause of it, I haven't actually re-tested; but I wouldn't see what's wrong now

 16:25:40 <pitti> ah, likewise, sorry

 16:26:24 <jibel> this is the only issue, no problem with server, and we'll review desktop images

 16:26:25 <jibel> ..

 16:26:35 <slangasek> cjwatson, jibel: should 922646 be targeted to alpha-2?  or should this be release-noted off for this milestone?

 16:26:40 <cjwatson> grumble - I'll have a look

 16:26:49 <slangasek> (IMHO it's not alpha-critical)

 16:26:51 <cjwatson> slangasek: we're going to run into it in iso testing anyway so better deal with it for a2

 16:26:55 <cjwatson> imo

 16:26:55 <slangasek> ok

 16:27:19 <slangasek> bug twiddled

 16:27:23 <slangasek> any other questions for jibel?

 16:28:05 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Security team Q&A - mdeslaur

 16:28:21 <mdeslaur> [link] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000754.html

 16:28:25 <mdeslaur> nothing further to report

 16:28:34 <slangasek> questions for mdeslaur?

 16:28:36 <mdeslaur> I've adjusted a couple of bugs

 16:28:41 <mdeslaur> ..

 16:29:31 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Kernel team Q&A - ogasawara

 16:29:35 <ogasawara> [LINK] https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000755.html

 16:29:35 <ogasawara> As noted in my email, we intend to upload our final Alpha-2 kernel

 16:29:35 <ogasawara> today.  If there are any fixes needing to land, I/we need to know about

 16:29:35 <ogasawara> them now.

 16:29:47 <ogasawara> Any questions?

 16:29:48 <ogasawara> ..

 16:30:10 <slangasek> does the new kernel fix my laptop's 15% suspend failure rate? ;)

 16:30:20 <slangasek> moving on :)

 16:30:30 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Foundations team Q&A - cjwatson

 16:30:42 <cjwatson> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000768.html - sorry for late posting this week

 16:30:45 <cjwatson> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/canonical-foundations.html

 16:30:48 <cjwatson> We've caught up very slightly this week, but not by much.  Trying to make progress on upgrade handling which is a major outstanding chunk of work.

 16:30:51 <cjwatson> ..

 16:31:35 <slangasek> possibly of note is the resolvconf package landing in the seeds overnight, which has caused some upgrade and livecd failures

 16:31:44 <slangasek> I will be available for tarring and feathering after the meeting

 16:32:06 <ogasawara> slangasek: rls-p-tracking-bugs.html is back

 16:32:09 <slangasek> in the meantime, stgraber is working on getting those regressions fixed today

 16:32:14 <slangasek> ogasawara: thanks

 16:32:33 <slangasek> any other questions for foundations?

 16:32:37 <cjwatson> yes, I kicked some of the livecd builds but not all

 16:32:51 <stgraber> yeah! having a lot of fun fixing the world ;) (just discovered that LXC is broken too :))

 16:32:57 <cjwatson> due mostly to patch piloting this morning thoroughly distracting me

 16:34:00 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Server team Q&A - arosales

 16:34:17 <arosales> Hello

 16:34:24 <arosales> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000774.html

 16:34:34 <arosales> Still have a bug list we are working through, but oo critical bugs atm, openstack automation testing framwork now live.  MaaS also taking shape, and Juju Charm automated testing well underway.

 16:34:50 <arosales> Any questions?

 16:35:05 <arosales> s/oo/no/

 16:35:25 <arosales> ..

 16:35:30 <slangasek> arosales: any bugs that are a concern for your team for alpha-2 that aren't already on the targeted list?

 16:35:59 <arosales> not that I am aware of.

 16:36:26 <slangasek> ok, thanks

 16:36:32 <slangasek> [TOPIC] ARM team Q&A-  ogra_

 16:36:33 <arosales> sure, np.

 16:36:38 <ogra_> thats me !

 16:36:46 <ogra_> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000777.html

 16:37:12 <ogra_> i dont really know much about the d-i stuff yet, since that only came up yesterday and NCommander hasnt been around all day ...

 16:37:38 <ogra_> but i know that he (was supposed to) talked to cjwatson yaesterday about it

 16:37:42 <ogra_> ..

 16:38:14 <ogra_> cjwatson, anything to add on the plans ?

 16:38:16 <ogra_> ..

 16:38:22 <slangasek> ogra_: well, AIUI your team is asking for a d-i build for a kernel that we aren't even remotely going to consider providing security support for

 16:38:49 <ogra_> slangasek, right, my thought was to use a PPA, but michael claims that doesnt work

 16:38:55 <ogra_> ..

 16:39:03 <slangasek> I advised NCommander yesterday that the best option under the circumstances is probably to clone the d-i source package, maintaining it as a bzr branch, and push this separate package to universe

 16:39:14 <ogra_> ok

 16:39:17 <slangasek> cjwatson: ^^ not sure if you agree with that

 16:39:27 <slangasek> (we can also take this out-of-band for further discussion)

 16:39:45 <ogra_> sound like a lot extra work vs using a PPA though

 16:40:10 <ogra_> right, and its michaels project, i'm only the (uninformed) reporter here :)

 16:40:13 <ogra_> ..

 16:40:23 <slangasek> any other questions for ARM?

 16:40:33 <fabo> o/

 16:40:45 <cjwatson> slangasek: that sounds highly unpleasant ...

 16:40:49 <fabo> ogra_: any eta for m5 kernel tree to use?

 16:40:55 <slangasek> cjwatson: the whole thing is highly unpleasant, AFAICS :)

 16:41:03 <ogra_> fabo, its in the hands of linaro

 16:41:09 <fabo> mx5

 16:41:14 <cjwatson> I'd rather just hack d-i to build this image out of universe :P

 16:41:24 <ogra_> slangasek, cjwatson thats why i said PPA from the start ....

 16:41:33 <cjwatson> it won't make the situation particularly worse except that the images will end up in main/installer-arm*/

 16:41:45 <cjwatson> but they'll do that if you clone d-i too

 16:41:45 <slangasek> ogra_: cdimage pulling from a ppa is no less unpleasant

 16:41:55 <cjwatson> ... and there's no code for that

 16:41:56 <ogra_> cdimage ?

 16:42:06 <cjwatson> and PPAs don't support d-i custom uploads

 16:42:10 <ogra_> all we need is a netinst image

 16:42:15 <slangasek> that's not what I was told

 16:42:16 <cjwatson> you won't get that from a PPA

 16:42:22 <slangasek> anyway, let's offline this

 16:42:23 <ogra_> oh, ok

 16:42:27 <fabo> ogra_: sounds like we're asking to your team if we should use 3.1 or 3.2

 16:42:37 <ogra_> right, i'm to uninformed to even remotely discuss it

 16:42:40 <ogra_> ..

 16:43:20 <ogra_> fabo, ah, well, iirc that kernel is in universe, while 3.2 would be preferred we could live with a lower version

 16:43:32 <fabo> ok

 16:43:34 <fabo> ..

 16:43:37 <ogra_> the images we roll from it are community supported ones

 16:43:39 <ogra_> ..

 16:44:01 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Linaro team Q&A - fabo

 16:44:17 <fabo> hi

 16:44:18 <fabo> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000776.html

 16:44:45 <fabo> the only question I had, has been asked (mx5)

 16:44:49 <fabo> any questions?

 16:44:50 <fabo> ..

 16:45:05 <ogra_> funny how we both always write the same about the unity merge *g*

 16:45:07 <ogra_> ..

 16:45:37 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Ubuntu One Team Q&A -  joshuahoover

 16:46:09 <slangasek> no report on list

 16:46:13 <slangasek> no joshuahoover in channel

 16:46:15 <slangasek> so, moving on

 16:46:20 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Desktop Team Q&A  - pitti

 16:46:26 <pitti> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000761.html

 16:46:34 <pitti> nothign to add to that ATM, any questions?

 16:46:35 <pitti> ..

 16:47:26 <slangasek> pitti: I know that there's an openoffice.org upgrade ordering issue that's causing some upgrade test failures in jenkins; is that anything you guys are planning to tackle before a-2?

 16:47:40 <pitti> oh, again?

 16:48:00 <pitti> slangasek: wasn't, but I can add it to my list; I suppose there's a bug for it already

 16:48:01 <slangasek> "again" - I thought it's been pretty continuous :)

 16:48:07 <dbarth> pitti: o/

 16:48:10 <slangasek> jibel: do you have that bug number handy?

 16:48:24 <pitti> slangasek: I looked at it during my december stable+1 shift, but maybe it came back with the new lo

 16:48:57 <pitti> bug 917153 ?

 16:48:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917153 in libreoffice (Ubuntu Precise) "failed to upgrade from oneiric to precise: /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libicule.so.48: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917153

 16:49:07 <slangasek> yes, that's the one

 16:49:12 <pitti> that's something Sweetshark started working on

 16:49:15 <jibel> pitti, that's it.

 16:49:16 <pitti> but he's on holidays now

 16:49:19 <slangasek> ok

 16:49:36 <slangasek> so that's a "no" for alpha-2, right?

 16:49:47 <pitti> TBH I don't have much hope that me or someone else has the time to learn LibO packaging and fix that by a2

 16:49:52 <pitti> yes, pretty much

 16:50:17 <slangasek> ok

 16:50:23 <slangasek> anything else for desktop?

 16:50:28 <pitti> I'll fix the lightdm one on Monday

 16:50:29 <slangasek> dbarth: did you have a question for pitti?

 16:50:32 <pitti> (autologin conversion)

 16:50:55 <dbarth> yes, on the x.org upload, wether that contains the xfixes tweaks

 16:50:58 <dbarth> if you know

 16:51:01 <pitti> to unblock the configuration migration tests in jenkins

 16:51:03 <dbarth> otherwise i'll check the changelogs

 16:51:21 <pitti> dbarth: there were some uploads in RAOF's PPA, and I think they landed yesterday

 16:51:28 <dbarth> ah, sounds good

 16:51:36 <dbarth> so we should be unblocked now then

 16:51:36 <pitti> if https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxfixes/1:5.0-4ubuntu1 is what you were looking for

 16:51:40 <dbarth> cool

 16:51:52 <pitti> (that was the help-jason PPA)

 16:56:46 <Riddell> hi

 16:56:54 <Riddell> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000762.html

 16:57:00 <Riddell> python-qt4 was broken on arm but a fix is compiling away

 16:57:00 <Riddell> qtwebkit-source still broken on arm, waiting on infinity to get a fix in to kernel

 16:57:04 <Riddell> ..

 16:57:26 <slangasek> questions for Riddell?

 16:57:27 <ScottK> calligra also compiling away on arm ...

 16:57:38 <ogra_> as mentioned above :)

 16:57:39 <ogra_> ..

 16:57:43 <slangasek> Riddell: what fix into kernel is waited on?

 16:58:00 <Riddell> slangasek: something to let armhf use higher memory I think

 16:58:08 <slangasek> I thought that was done same-day last week

 16:58:24 <slangasek> Riddell: can I suggest you double-check with infinity on the current status?

 16:58:27 <ScottK> No.  Didn't work.

 16:58:33 <slangasek> oh

 16:58:37 <ScottK> slangasek: We did after the meeting last week.

 16:58:49 <ScottK> Got a rebuild on an upgraded machine done and it still failed.

 16:58:58 <slangasek> ok

 16:59:17 <slangasek> I believe that kernel fix has been tested in other contexts, though

 16:59:28 <slangasek> so if you're still OOMing on build, I think you need to look outside the kernel for the fix

 16:59:42 <slangasek> because now you're hitting the 3G limit instead of the 2G limit, and that's non-negotiable

 17:00:08 <slangasek> anyway, I'd suggest following up with infinity

 17:00:11 <Riddell> ok needs looking into then

 17:01:45 <stgraber> Daviey: I started the update of LTSP today as it needs fixing for resolvconf, hopefully it'll be uploaded this weekend (if testing doesn't show any major breakage as I don't want to break alpha2 :))

 17:01:53 <highvoltage> and Edubuntu is in UDW next week

 17:02:36 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Xubuntu Team Q&A - madnick or charlie-tca

 17:02:36 <stgraber> worst case scenerio, I'll cherry-pick the fix for resolvconf into our current LTSP and will look at fixing the udeb to avoid the current race condition (release targeted bug for alpha-2)

 17:05:28 <scott-work> ..

 17:06:32 <slangasek> I see feedback on the bug from superm1 suggesting that this needs to be fixed in whatever greeter package ubuntustudio is using

 17:08:56 <Laney> not much to report, ppc backlog is a bit of a concern

 17:09:09 <Laney> also ftbfs are a bit high so we should do something about that

 17:09:17 <Laney> and thanks to the patch pilots: sponsor queue is heading in the right direction

 17:09:21 <Laney> :-)

 17:09:23 <Laney> ..

 17:10:21 <slangasek> Laney: any particulars on ftbfs that are worth drawing out, or is it general archive malaise?

 17:10:27 <slangasek> (or un-analyzed)

 17:11:02 <Laney> I haven't analysed it yet, but another drive like we had last cycle would be nice (don't know if a rebuild is planned to get the numbers refreshed)

 17:11:18 <slangasek> doko is planning a rebuild now-ish

 17:11:30 <slangasek> I don't know if it encompasses universe however... actually that might be a toolchain test rebuild

 17:11:34 <slangasek> so nevermind

 17:11:39 <slangasek> please talk to doko about your needS :)

 17:11:59 <Laney> I just looked at qa.uw.c/ftbfs
