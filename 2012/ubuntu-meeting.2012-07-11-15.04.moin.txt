 15:04:47 <cjwatson> #topic lightning round

 15:04:53 <cjwatson> Launchpad and archive admin tools:

 15:04:53 <cjwatson> * API queue client will be feature-complete once the current state of devel is QAed and deployed.

 15:04:56 <cjwatson> * Went through all archive admin tools based on the old queue script and either migrated them to the API (new-binary-debian-universe, kernel-overrides) or dropped them (new-remove-duplicates).

 15:05:00 <cjwatson> * Fixed privacy bug in PackageUpload API.

 15:05:03 <cjwatson> * Tweaked auto-sync to take advantage of new PackageUpload API work.

 15:05:05 <cjwatson> * Landed work to automatically copy package description translations between pockets (awaiting deployment).

 15:05:08 <cjwatson> Installer:

 15:05:11 <cjwatson> * Worked with xnox to track down and fix bug 1020574.

 15:05:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1020574 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "SystemError: Broken pipe while installing language packs" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020574

 15:05:13 <cjwatson> * Removed reliance on an old X server argument for Plymouth transitioning (bug 1019377).

 15:05:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1019377 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "ubiquity-dm crashed with XStartupError in run(): X server exited with return code 1" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1019377

 15:05:16 <cjwatson> * Worked on tracking down bug 1023036.  No real luck as yet.

 15:05:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1023036 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Quantal) "Error on /usr/share/ubiquity/plugininstall.py", line 1687, affecting desktop images (preseeded install)" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023036

 15:05:19 <cjwatson> Other:

 15:05:21 <cjwatson> * Cleaned up various bugs (mostly related to the switch to Python 3 or to recent package splits) in software-properties, update-manager, and ubuntu-release-upgrader.

 15:05:24 <cjwatson> * Some progress on converting the server image to use a squashfs for the base system.

 15:05:27 <cjwatson> * Fixed up compiler warnings in jbigkit, allowing it to be moved to main (bug 993304) and hence allowing syncs of tiff and tiff3.

 15:06:12 <stokachu> - Working +1 this month, started going through universe failed builds.

 15:06:14 <stokachu> - Vacation next week.

 15:06:15 <cjwatson> Anyone want to volunteer to help out stokachu with sponsorships?

 15:06:16 <stokachu> ...

 15:06:28 <ev> - Short week; holiday on Tuesday.

 15:06:28 <ev> - Lots of work on the debconf GTK+ redesign:

 15:06:28 <ev> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#When_there_is_a_Debconf_prompt

 15:06:28 <ev> - Built a new set of tests around the dialogs. There were a lot of things

 15:06:28 <ev> that were already broken that this caught, like the password dialog not

 15:06:29 <ev> handling a default one.

 15:06:29 <ev> - Implemented all of the dialog types. Just need to handle packing the

 15:06:30 <ev> select and multiselect types into a scrolled window when there's more than

 15:06:30 <ev> 6 items.

 15:06:35 <ev> - Started documenting how people can contribute to errors.ubuntu.com and

 15:06:35 <ev> dumping my personal todo list into bug reports:

 15:06:35 <ev> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker/Contributing

 15:06:35 <ev> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker/Contributing/Debconf

 15:06:35 <ev> - Sat down with Matthew to come up for a better design to the compiz/apport

 15:06:36 <ev> application hang dialog. The implementation is mostly there, but I'll need

 15:06:36 <ev> to spend at least a day on the changes he's going to create as a result of

 15:06:37 <ev> our discussion.

 15:06:39 <ev> - Continued discussion with Martin over my API for applications handling

 15:06:39 <ev> recoverable errors in apport. We have a fairly straightforward plan that

 15:06:40 <ev> involves passing the data over stdout to a special apport binary,

 15:06:40 <ev> nul-separated. This replaces the existing attempt at a solution which used

 15:07:03 <ogra_> .. ?

 15:07:13 <stokachu> i think he flooded himself offline

 15:07:17 <ogra_> haha

 15:07:29 <ev> what, me?

 15:07:35 <cjwatson> 16:06 <ev>   nul-separated. This replaces the existing attempt at a solution which used

 15:07:38 <cjwatson> (end)

 15:07:39 <ev> I HATE IRC

 15:07:43 <stokachu> lol

 15:07:53 <ev> DBus.

 15:08:22 <bdmurray> investigation into and fixing of apport-package bugs not being tagged package-conflict and not having a DuplicateSignature.txt

 15:08:26 <bdmurray> apport fix for parsing DpkgTerminalLog in python 3 (bytes vs strings)

 15:08:26 <bdmurray> upload apt-clone modification to remove usernames and passwords for apt source files

 15:08:29 <bdmurray> ubuntu-release-upgrader modification to gather apt-clone system state again

 15:08:37 <bdmurray> some holidays last week

 15:08:52 <bdmurray> ⌁ done ⌁

 15:09:21 <barry> status for two weeks since last wed was a usa holiday: rather weird couple of weeks because of weather issues, but anyway.  bug 1018579, bug 1016170, bug 1019618, bug 823150, spun python-mode 6.0.10 for debian.  worked a bit on dbus merge sid->quantal but it's tricky so stalled.  i continue to work on port of xapian to python 3 via cython.  mostly going well, but it's make-progress-hit-roadblock-rinse-repeat.

 15:09:21 <barry> <git@github.com:warsaw/xapian.git> done.

 15:10:46 <stgraber> oh, already :)

 15:10:58 <stgraber> - Containers

 15:10:58 <stgraber> - Some more apparmor improvements in quantal.

 15:10:58 <stgraber> - Pushed SRU to -proposed bundling most of the fixes from quantal (2 important fixes, 2 common wishlist and 4 minor fixes)

 15:11:01 <stgraber> - Implemented clone() in python API, defined next steps for LXC API with Serge. Fixed some bugs in the python module.

 15:11:04 <stgraber> - Installer

 15:11:06 <stgraber> - Merged os-prober

 15:11:07 <cjwatson> barry: possibly; I have no bandwidth to investigate at the moment though :-(

 15:11:09 <stgraber> - Debugged a weird IPv6 regression, tracked down to bug 1023174

 15:11:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1023174 in linux (Ubuntu) ""ip -6 addr flush" flushes much more than just the addresses" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023174

 15:11:17 <stgraber> - Networking

 15:11:19 <stgraber> - Got IPv6 testing working again on quantal, simplified the code to be pretty self-contained (no longer requires IPv6 connectivity), next step is to send that to QA.

 15:11:22 <stgraber> - bug 1023437

 15:11:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1023437 in ifupdown (Ubuntu) "ifupdown conflicts with netbase both of which own /etc/init.d/networking" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023437

 15:11:25 <stgraber> - Other

 15:11:27 <stgraber> - Finally got around to merging open-iscsi, first time since jaunty... ended up dropping all our delta except for the upstart job, added some glue to handle the upgrades and now finishing to test in d-i.

 15:11:31 <stgraber> - Some ARB app review, the app showdown made the ARB New queue reach 140 packages... Still over 20 or so to review today...

 15:11:34 <stgraber> - Patch pilot on Monday

 15:11:37 <stgraber> - Spent a few minutes dealing with a compiz regression in a copied SRU (uploaded a revert).

 15:11:40 <barry> cjwatson: no worries, it's not fatal.  at least i have a machine to debug with if you need

 15:11:40 <stgraber> - TODO this week

 15:11:42 <stgraber> - Finish reviewing/triaging ppp and libnl-3 bugs, then start looking at SRUs for the network packages.

 15:11:45 <stgraber> - Go through the pending-sru and help for these that are stuck on verification-needed

 15:11:48 <stgraber> (DONE)

 15:13:37 <stgraber> stokachu: so that's 977947, 977952 and 977940 that are ready for sponsoring?

 15:13:58 <stokachu> stgraber: yea 2 of them are merge proposals i believe

 15:14:04 <stokachu> stgraber: ones got a debdiff attached

 15:14:16 <stgraber> stokachu: ok. I'll add to my todo, hopefully I can get to it this afternoon

 15:14:26 <stokachu> stgraber: cool man

 15:16:21 <cjwatson> #topic bugs

 15:16:47 <bdmurray> bug 1006860 seems to have a patch in it now

 15:16:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1006860 in gdb (Ubuntu) "gdb crashes when loading core files (in is_ctor_or_dtor)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1006860

 15:16:51 <cjwatson> anyone have anything we need to be looking at?  as mentioned earlier, my attention's mostly on 1023036 once the python3 bit gets fixed

 15:17:17 <stokachu> other than the 2 bugs im in progress on, are there other multiarch that need attention?

 15:18:03 <cjwatson> bdmurray: seb128 and tvoss were discussing that earlier on -devel; seb128 was going to grab doko about it when he's next online

 15:18:43 <bdmurray> cjwatson: got it thanks

 15:19:25 <bdmurray> bug 1022864 just came into the rls-q queue

 15:19:25 <cjwatson> stokachu: there's bug 990761 in partner; infinity was looking at that yesterday, but might not mind having it taken off him.  (I think my last comment in that bug may be a bit simplistic, since it's not clear that acroread has been converted to expect multiarch; there's more detail in the duplicate bug 998837.)

 15:19:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1022864 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu Precise) "Oneiric to Precise upgrade test failed: User settings are not preserved on upgrade" [Critical,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1022864

 15:19:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 990761 in acroread (Ubuntu) "acroread 9.5.1 is not installable on Ubuntu Precise amd64 system" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/990761

 15:19:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 990761 in acroread (Ubuntu) "duplicate for #998837 acroread 9.5.1 is not installable on Ubuntu Precise amd64 system" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/990761

 15:19:33 <stokachu> these last two finish the requirements needed for lotus notes on amd64

 15:19:42 <cjwatson> 1022864 is such a BS critical :)

 15:19:58 * cjwatson drops to high

 15:20:23 <stokachu> cjwatson: want me to put those on my list?

 15:20:48 <cjwatson> stokachu: If you wouldn't mind, I think it'd be helpful

 15:21:03 <stokachu> cjwatson: ok ive got them added to be worked on

 15:21:12 <cjwatson> Does anyone know what deals with gtk-theme migration?  it's not ubuntu-release-upgrader, and I suspect it's something in desktop

 15:21:29 <ev> no idea

 15:22:04 <cjwatson> Maybe gsettings-desktop-schemas since that ships that gsettings schema

 15:22:11 <bdmurray> if it is affecting precise is the ubuntu-release-upgrader task really accurate?

 15:22:24 <cjwatson> bdmurray: Probably not, but it's inaccurate anyway

 15:23:09 <cjwatson> Sent over to gsettings-desktop-schema and desktop can worry about it

 15:25:44 <cjwatson> bug 1021293 has also come up for 12.04, and so far I haven't had time to figure it out

 15:25:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1021293 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu 12.04 install stalls when doing apt-get upgrade" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021293

 15:26:23 <stokachu> i'd take it but i think im at my threshold

 15:26:39 <cjwatson> Yeah, I may still get to it after all but wanted to mention it

 15:27:13 <stokachu> ill add it to my list anyway and see if i can contribute

 15:27:37 <cjwatson> OK.  Suspect it needs strace -f attached at an appropriate point, since it already has debconf debugging and that isn't being informative enough

 15:28:14 <cjwatson> #topic AOB

 15:28:15 <cjwatson> anything else?

 15:29:15 <stokachu> oh

 15:29:25 <stokachu> +1 is it recommended to use pbuilder or sbuild?

 15:29:41 <stokachu> ive just been using pbuilder but it sounds like sbuild can do some sort of resume building

 15:29:43 * barry prefers sbuild

 15:30:05 <ev> stokachu: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/PreferredTechnologies#Building

 15:30:07 <stokachu> launchpad uses sbuild for their build service correct?

 15:30:28 <stokachu> ev: awesome! thanks

 15:30:32 <barry> stokachu: sbuild has lots of nice hooks, and when the build goes awry, you can do several things to help with debugging

 15:31:00 <stokachu> awesome thats what i needed

 15:31:03 <barry> stokachu: also: http://www.wefearchange.org/2011/09/sbuild-with-local-newer-dependencies.html

 15:31:23 <stokachu> barry: nice got it bookmarked :D

 15:32:26 <cjwatson> stokachu: Launchpad uses an old fork of sbuild

 15:32:45 <cjwatson> One of these days maybe we'll get it current

 15:33:03 <cjwatson> But yeah, that would be my recommendation too

 15:33:12 <stokachu> ok sweet, thanks guys

 15:34:48 <cjwatson> all right
