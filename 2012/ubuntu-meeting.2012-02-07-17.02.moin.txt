 17:02:46 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] ARM Status (ppisati)

 17:02:50 <ppisati> UUID support: Found a way to support an initrd-less kernel using GPT, an hybrid mbr and the ROOTUUID boot parameter, kernel seems to be good already.

 17:02:53 <ppisati> lp709245 ("ARM SMP scheduler performance bug"): Still bisecting latest P kernel trying to find where the fix for this issue has been embedded in the TI BSP - whenever i turn on the the corresponding upstream errata (PL310_ERRATA_769419) the kernel hangs on boot, so there must be a previous patch clashing in there. Now i'm down to a ~160 commits window.

 17:02:58 <ppisati> P/omap4: Nothing new to report this week.

 17:03:00 <ppisati> ..

 17:04:10 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Blueprint: hardware-p-kernel-power-management (cking)

 17:04:15 <cking> Power Management:

 17:04:15 <cking> * CPU governor testing (Intel only) (will test AMD CPUs later)

 17:04:38 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Precise Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:04:40 <ogasawara> Last week we rebased to v3.2.4 and uploaded.  We've recently rebased to v3.2.5 and plan to upload shortly.  Note that Beta-1 is on the horizon with Beta Freeze approximately 2 weeks away.  We'll be prepping our Beta-1 kernel next week.  If there are any patches which need to land, submit them now.

 17:04:51 <ogasawara> I'd like to also note that we've opened the Q git repo for anyone interested (git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-q.git).  At this time, it is strictly for development/testing purposes only and will not be supported until Q officially opens in the archive.

 17:04:59 <ogasawara> Important upcoming dates:

 17:04:59 <ogasawara> * Thurs Feb 23 - Beta Freeze (~2 weeks)

 17:04:59 <ogasawara> * Thurs Mar 01 - Beta 1

 17:04:59 <ogasawara> ..

 17:05:21 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: CVE's (apw)

 17:05:24 <apw> Currently we have 73 CVEs on our radar, six new CVEs were added this week.

 17:05:26 <apw> See the CVE matrix for the current list:

 17:05:30 <apw> [LINK] http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve/pkg/ALL-linux.html

 17:05:32 <apw> 

 17:05:34 <apw> Overall we have pushed the backlog down by approximatly 2 CVEs this week:

 17:05:42 <apw> 

 17:05:44 <apw> We have also pushed another CVE back to security for review.  This backlog

 17:05:46 <apw> is increasing.
