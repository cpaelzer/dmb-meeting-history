 12:09:29 <head_victim> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1200 UTC 26th September 2012. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:09:38 <head_victim> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:09:51 <head_victim> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:09:51 <head_victim> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:09:51 <head_victim> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:09:52 <head_victim> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:09:56 <head_victim> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:10:09 <head_victim> Wow, that looks big all at once

 12:10:10 <head_victim> Anyway

 12:10:34 <head_victim> #topic Julian Fernandes Ubuntu Membership Application

 12:11:16 <head_victim> julian_fern: while we read up on your application can you please introduce yourself to the board

 12:11:25 <julian_fern> Hello :)

 12:11:41 <julian_fern> My name is Julian Fernandes

 12:12:09 <julian_fern> I also work with Nginx and WordPress optimization on Ubuntu Servers

 12:12:30 <julian_fern> Talking about myself isn't my strong point, so i think my wiki page says it all :)

 12:12:36 <julian_fern> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/julianfernandes

 12:13:19 <tiagoscd> I just like to say that julian_fern has done a great job in Brazil, helping many users, writing posts about Ubuntu, speaking in conferences

 12:13:31 <Ursinha> he's just too humble to talk about what all he's been doing :)

 12:13:35 * Ursinha is cheering for julian_fern

 12:13:37 <tiagoscd> he keeps a hard and daily work to support Ubuntu Brazilian community

 12:13:50 <tiagoscd> as Ubuntu Brazilian Communiyt Council member I strongly endorse his membership

 12:15:21 <julian_fern> head_victim: yeah, the friendships i made when i joined the Ubuntu community are great :)

 12:15:23 <julian_fern> hmmm

 12:15:39 <julian_fern> i think we have some photos at our G+ page

 12:15:40 <head_victim> julian_fern: the community is what drew me in as well :)

 12:16:50 <julian_fern> This is the Latinoware page, the event i'm gonna attend next month: http://2012.latinoware.org/?lang=en

 12:17:10 <julian_fern> I will talk about WordPress optimization with Ubuntu Server and the future of gaming on Linux

 12:17:33 <julian_fern> i will also be there with Ubuntu-BR, helping users to install Ubuntu and clearing doubts they may have
