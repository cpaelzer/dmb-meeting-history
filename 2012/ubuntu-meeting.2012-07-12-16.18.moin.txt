 16:19:26 <asomething> Hi all! Any one around for the motu meeting?

 16:20:13 <asomething> looks like we have one agenda item besides our standing ones

 16:20:17 <asomething> MOTU School Doodle poll results update and discussion

 16:20:24 <coolbhavi> m there!

 16:21:29 <coolbhavi> asomething, one good news is we had a good response for the 1st school session on restart yesterday

 16:21:50 <asomething> #topic MOTU School Doodle poll results update and discussion

 16:22:25 * tumbleweed waves from debconf

 16:22:45 <asomething> coolbhavi, great, how'd the session go? good attendance?

 16:23:19 <coolbhavi> asomething, yes there was a reasonable turn up yesterday

 16:23:45 * coolbhavi searches his bookmarks for the poll link

 16:23:48 <asomething> are the logs up one the wiki somewhere?

 16:24:54 <asomething> coolbhavi, http://doodle.com/w9p6hh43hfwk8xmp

 16:25:32 <coolbhavi> thanks asomething  the logs are linked by nhandler today I believe on the wiki

 16:27:07 <asomething> one thing I've noticed is that we have https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Packaging/Training and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/School

 16:27:16 <asomething> i wonder if these should be merged

 16:28:04 <coolbhavi> yes asomething I'll do that over the next week

 16:28:30 <asomething> great

 16:29:00 <asomething> #action coolbhavi, merge https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Packaging/Training and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/School

 16:29:00 * meetingology coolbhavi, merge https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Packaging/Training and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/School

 16:30:19 <coolbhavi> asomething, based on the timings feedback I got here is the post I posted on the mailing list: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2012-June/007267.html

 16:30:29 <asomething> is there anything that could go better for the next class? was there some kind of help you could have used that you don't feel you got?

 16:30:59 <coolbhavi> asomething, yes there is a streamlining process in my mind

 16:32:04 <coolbhavi> basically to sustain the school we need to have a team who co ordinate with various people and setup sessions

 16:32:27 <coolbhavi> fitting across most time zones

 16:33:03 <coolbhavi> doing a bit of blogging about the sessions just a week before the sessions

 16:33:36 <asomething> #action asomething, help blog about the next motu school session

 16:33:36 * meetingology asomething, help blog about the next motu school session

 16:33:37 <coolbhavi> and sending a remainder to the list 2 or 3 days before the sessions

 16:34:15 <coolbhavi> asomething, any views on the same welcome!

 16:34:31 <asomething> ya, in the past we've struggled to have trainings on a regular basis. I think you're probably hitting the same issues

 16:35:53 <asomething> has anyone stepped up to lead the next class?

 16:36:35 <coolbhavi> hmm I see a https://launchpad.net/~packaging-training-coordinators team on LP maybe we can open up a new team and merge the same as in the case of d-a-t

 16:37:31 <coolbhavi> asomething, I got a lukewarm response for handling sessions on the list so I took the first session

 16:37:56 <coolbhavi> keeping in mind the audience turnout

 16:41:36 <asomething> so from your email, it looks like 27th July will be the next class, right?

 16:42:14 <asomething> #link http://doodle.com/w9p6hh43hfwk8xmp

 16:42:15 <coolbhavi> yes

 16:42:26 <asomething> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2012-June/007267.html

 16:43:41 <asomething> #info 27th July will be the MOTU School next class, still needs an instructor

 16:45:45 <asomething> so is there anything else to discuss? I don't think we have any thing new for the ARB to report back

 16:46:41 <coolbhavi> no I am done from my side

 16:47:17 <asomething> #topic Next MOTU meeting

 16:47:44 <asomething> so turn out was a bit low =)

 16:47:46 <coolbhavi> ll catchup on the list on motu school

 16:47:53 <coolbhavi> :)

 16:48:28 <asomething> if we're going to keep the every other week pace, that put's us on 26 July

 16:49:13 <coolbhavi> +1

 16:49:23 <asomething> I can't commit to chairing the next meeting, but I'll send out the minutes from this one and commit to sending the reminder mails to the list

 16:49:42 <asomething> #action send out meeting minutes

 16:49:42 * meetingology send out meeting minutes

 16:50:10 <asomething> #action asomething, update wiki headers and send out reminders for next meeting

 16:50:10 * meetingology asomething, update wiki headers and send out reminders for next meeting

 16:50:32 <asomething> guess that's all for today

 16:51:02 <coolbhavi> same here but I can chair i think next

 16:51:42 <asomething> #endmeeting
