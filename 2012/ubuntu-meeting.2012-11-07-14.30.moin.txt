 14:30:20 <smartboyhw> Yeah

 14:30:34 <balloons> We split the difference.. 30 mins late or 30 mins early

 14:30:37 <balloons> I'll let you decide

 14:30:44 <balloons> who's actually made it to this random event?

 14:31:01 <smartboyhw> I did

 14:31:57 <smartboyhw> balloons what do you mean on that "split the difference" thing?

 14:33:43 <balloons> I meant time

 14:34:00 <balloons> anyways, I guess I'll abandon the traditional agenda to share what's going on

 14:34:27 <smartboyhw> balloons: XD

 14:34:32 <balloons> For raring, as you saw, lots of changes to how we will release. There won't be any alpha releases, and our testing will be cadence based

 14:35:02 <balloons> I've started to put together a calendar of what weeks will be cadence weeks, and what we will plan to test during those weeks

 14:35:19 <smartboyhw> yeah

 14:35:31 <balloons> in addition, work is beginning on all the background stuff. A new quality report, and you can get your feet wet in trying out some of the automated testing tools

 14:36:06 * TheLordOfTime yawns

 14:36:08 <TheLordOfTime> yes i'm still awake :P

 14:36:14 <smartboyhw> balloons: Give us more info on UYAH please

 14:36:30 <TheLordOfTime> (sorry late statement saying i'm here :P)

 14:36:31 <smartboyhw> *UTAH

 14:36:34 <balloons> UTAH?

 14:36:41 <smartboyhw> yes

 14:36:47 <smartboyhw> typo sorry

 14:36:57 <balloons> ahh yes. The platform QA team said they would be giving hangouts this cycle on it

 14:37:16 <balloons> it's just a wrapper though. For us, I think we'd be more interested in autopkgtest and autopilot

 14:38:15 <smartboyhw> balloons what IS autopilot?

 14:38:31 <balloons> autopilot is an automated testing tool -- for gui's

 14:39:05 <balloons> so it's a functional testing tool. for us, plans are in place to do things like automate installer testing from the end user perspective (in addition to the pre-seeding and other testing that happens)

 14:39:36 <balloons> this will shift our manual testing goals from doing lots of testing at a high level, to doing more in-depth testing

 14:40:43 <smartboyhw> ok

 14:42:01 <balloons> that's everything in a nutsheel

 14:42:08 * smartboyhw wonders whether balloons himself will become automated

 14:42:36 <balloons> I'll send out an email today talking about how you can get involved.. now is a good time to take advantage of the lower QA needs and do some experiments and planning

 14:42:52 <smartboyhw> yeah yeah yeah

 14:42:57 <balloons> that's basically what the next few weeks will be

 14:43:10 <smartboyhw> ok

 14:43:11 <balloons> after the holidays and we're in 2013, we'll be in full gear again

 14:44:00 <smartboyhw> that's good since I can finish my exam in January and return to QA

 14:45:28 <balloons> excellent

 14:45:34 <balloons> any other comments / questions?

 14:45:43 <balloons> if not, we'll wrap this up for now

 14:45:45 <smartboyhw> no.

 14:45:54 <balloons> and try and get a handle on the proper time.. my calendar is adjusted now :-)

 14:45:58 <smartboyhw> lol
