 20:04:24 <czajkowski> welcome to the EMEA today

 20:04:37 <czajkowski> thanks for coming and well work our way through the list as they are on the wiki page

 20:04:47 <czajkowski> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/EMEA

 20:05:23 <czajkowski> first up is jo-erlend as redmar isn';t here

 20:05:31 * trijntje is redmar

 20:05:37 <czajkowski> trijntje: ahh ok

 20:05:40 <czajkowski> trijntje: start again so

 20:05:58 <czajkowski> #topic trijntje Membership

 20:06:04 <czajkowski> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/redmar

 20:06:11 <czajkowski> trijntje: thanks for coming along

 20:06:28 <highvoltage> hi!

 20:06:34 <czajkowski> trijntje: so care to tell us about yourself ?

 20:07:20 <trijntje> sure. I'm a student from the Netherlands, I've been using ubuntu since Gutsy and my main involvement with ubuntu is with the Dutch Translation Team and helping people via IRC

 20:08:17 <czajkowski> trijntje: so how do you feel the Ubuntu community has grown in that time ?

 20:08:54 <highvoltage> trijntje: are you involved with any LoCo activities? Have you ever participated in any local translation events before?

 20:09:06 <trijntje> I'm not sure about the wider community, since the first few years I only followed the loco team

 20:09:53 <trijntje> when I first started translating the dutch team had just been revived by cumulus007 after being dead for a couple of years, so there has been a lot of improvement there

 20:10:28 <trijntje> I have participated in a number of online 'translation sprints', but I've not been to any local events in person

 20:10:30 <highvoltage> trijntje: if you could change any one thing in the translation community, what would that be?

 20:10:39 <highvoltage> (or even Ubuntu, if you like)

 20:11:55 <trijntje> We do get quite a number of people who want to join the team, but never really follow through to become a full member. It would be nice if that changed, but I'm not sure how

 20:12:35 <trijntje> We've tried a number of things like appointing a mentor for new translators, but that didn't really help

 20:12:37 <FireBeard> trijntje: spammed this channel, so I thought I'd join

 20:12:57 <trijntje> probably it's just the fact that translating is hard work, and there is alway's more of it ;)

 20:13:25 <highvoltage> thanks trijntje

 20:13:27 <czajkowski> nods

 20:13:32 <ogra_> FireBeard, feel free to tell us about trijntje if you have anything to say or to praise him or so :)

 20:13:55 <FireBeard> nah, he just said that you guys were debating him, and asked us to watch

 20:14:07 <FireBeard> I'm here for a possible trainwreck ;)

 20:14:17 <trijntje> haha

 20:14:20 <jo-erlend> :)

 20:14:23 <ogra_> heh, great

 20:14:27 <czajkowski> ok are we ready to vote folks

 20:14:29 * ogra_ is ready to vote

 20:14:31 <czajkowski> nice testimonals btw

 20:14:44 <ogra_> ++

 20:14:52 <FireBeard> I don't know trijntje all that well, he did help me once or twice, when I had a question tho

 20:14:53 <trijntje> thanks, though I did not write them ;)

 20:17:10 <highvoltage> I'm ready to vote

 20:17:21 * ogra_ too, but i have one question though

 20:17:23 <FireBeard> you already voted, didn't you?

 20:17:34 <czajkowski> jo-erlend: thanks for coming

 20:17:39 <ogra_> "it's better to drown your sorrows than teach them how to swim"

 20:17:42 <jo-erlend> thanks for having me. :)

 20:17:48 <ogra_> jo-erlend, in what do you drown them usually ?

 20:17:50 <ogra_> met ?

 20:18:19 * ogra_ thinks thats one of these candidates where we all think "huh, he isnt a member yet" ?

 20:18:25 <FireBeard> glad to witnessed this, bye

 20:18:40 <highvoltage> ogra_: indeed.

 20:18:47 <jo-erlend> ogra_, hehe, that depends on the situation. :)

 20:18:52 * stgraber is ready to vote

 20:18:58 <iulian> jo-erlend: What situation? :)

 20:19:06 * iulian too.

 20:19:49 <czajkowski> jo-erlend: so recently you've been rather vocal on the unity mailing list, do you think being a member will make you step back a bit before you reply sometimes and possibly think more about the CoC and the fact you're an Ubutnu member?

 20:20:35 <highvoltage> Personally I think it's better for someone to step over the line a bit now and again than be afraid to speak up and participate.

 20:20:37 <jo-erlend> czajkowski, I try to consider the CoC in any case. I don't always succeed, but I do take it seriously, or I wouldn't have signed it.

 20:21:00 <czajkowski> hmm ok

 20:21:11 <iulian> Fair enough.

 20:21:32 <czajkowski> jo-erlend: how do you see your role in the community growning ?

 20:21:34 <jo-erlend> if you look at the large number of debates I've participated in, I think you'll find that I hardly ever loose my cool. And when I do, I have no fear of apologizing for it afterwards.

 20:22:41 <highvoltage> It's also really easy for someone to read something into an email that isn't even there.

 20:22:43 <jo-erlend> czajkowski, my involvement with askubuntu won't be reduced. I've recently taken over as a contact for the Norwegian loco, and I'm just beginning to connect to different news media

 20:22:59 <czajkowski> ok

 20:23:22 <czajkowski> anyother questions or comments folks?

 20:23:30 <drubin> nope

 20:23:32 <highvoltage> I've seen calm conversations on lists between people I know and then I have someone else who reads it who comes to my desk and say "omg did you see that flameware on ubuntu-devel!?"... and then I explain to them that it's not that at all, and it's easier to tell when you know the people somewhat.

 20:23:35 <jo-erlend> I'm getting more serious about my work with support, documentation and ... PR. But I'm also working more on code now.

 20:26:29 <czajkowski> #topic heartsmagic membership application

 20:26:33 <czajkowski> iulian: patience

 20:26:43 <czajkowski> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/heartsmagic

 20:27:07 <czajkowski> heartsmagic: welcome and thanks for coming to the meeting

 20:27:12 <heartsmagic> thank you

 20:27:26 <iulian> Welcome heartsmagic.

 20:28:31 <czajkowski> heartsmagic: so care to tell us about you and your role in the ubuntu community ?

 20:29:50 <heartsmagic> my name is serkan and ı am 32 years old. I have been managing Ubuntu Turkey Loco team as I stated for many years with my friends. I think this is the biggest role for me in the Ubuntu community

 20:30:33 <heartsmagic> we have some subgroups, I am trying to keep them alive

 20:30:56 <ogra_> hmm, if you are leading the LoCO there was nobody wanting to write a testimonial for you ?

 20:31:05 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: does the loco team have a website or list of accomplishments?

 20:31:12 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: is it an official loco?

 20:31:26 <czajkowski> #link http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-tr/events/history

 20:31:38 <heartsmagic> ogra_, honostly I dint tell them

 20:32:03 <ogra_> ooh, you should have done ... testimonials weight a lot in our decision process

 20:32:06 <heartsmagic> highvoltage, we don't keep a list like that, and we are not an *official* loco team right now

 20:32:07 <iulian> heartsmagic: It's an important step for you. I think that you should've.

 20:33:00 <heartsmagic> sure, but there is not any testimonials right now, sorry

 20:34:23 <czajkowski> heartsmagic: we do look at how people interact with the community not just their loco

 20:34:32 <czajkowski> is there someone else who could vouch for you?

 20:34:56 <ogra_> (how about bytan who leads the loco with you)

 20:35:08 <heartsmagic> vouch for me?

 20:35:21 <heartsmagic> then who vouch for bytan :)

 20:35:23 <ogra_> write a testimonial ...

 20:35:25 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: loco work is definitely hard work. it's great that you've been keeping up with it over the years

 20:35:32 <ogra_> or come to the meeting and praise you etc

 20:35:55 <heartsmagic> czajkowski, I am interacting with community through our Loco

 20:36:05 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: it's useful for us if we could hear back from other people who have worked with you. they can leave a message under testimonials and also cheer for you in the RMB meetings

 20:36:45 <czajkowski> heartsmagic: I think it would be better if you could come back at another meeting with some testimonals on your page as it's rather hard now to judge

 20:37:02 <czajkowski> rather than giving you a -1 its what I would recommend tbh

 20:37:25 <czajkowski> ogra_: highvoltage stgraber iulian drubin thoughts?

 20:37:30 <drubin> I am for czajkowski's suggestion

 20:37:32 * ogra_ agrees

 20:37:37 <highvoltage> yep

 20:37:39 <stgraber> yep

 20:37:47 <iulian> heartsmagic: Also, it would be nice if you could improve your wiki page.

 20:37:53 <czajkowski> heartsmagic: I dont like turning people donw and discouraging people

 20:37:57 <drubin> I think you heartsmagic is on the right path but hard to judge been reading every thing

 20:37:58 <heartsmagic> again pr :)

 20:38:10 <czajkowski> but if yo coudl update the wiki page and get testimonals it really would be better to come back then :)

 20:38:13 <czajkowski> please

 20:38:24 * iulian nods.

 20:38:29 <heartsmagic> no I wont i think :)

 20:38:36 <iulian> heartsmagic: Why's that?

 20:39:06 <heartsmagic> I mean if telling how I participate is not enogh for you, I wont insist on being a member

 20:39:24 <drubin> If you don't want to come back to re-apply why would you want to apply in the first place

 20:39:25 <heartsmagic> testimonials is good but musnt be a mandatory

 20:39:36 <ogra_> heartsmagic, we are supposed to judge by your interaction with others over the time you worked with the community, if nobody tells us about how you helped them, how should we judge ?

 20:39:58 <iulian> heartsmagic: No, that's the whole point. You should try again. I have to disagree with you on that, testimonials play a very important role.

 20:40:00 <drubin> heartsmagic: Yes but all your work has been working with people not writing code or answering forums or translations so there is no way for us to double check on things

 20:40:08 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: you don't have to insist. we think you're membership material but we'd like some feedback from the people you have worked with. unfortunately the ubuntu project is too big for us to know everyone personally, so we can't instictively know what you have done in the past.

 20:40:28 <highvoltage> and that's standard procedure for every singly person who has applied for membership before.

 20:40:31 <heartsmagic> I got it, but you asked why

 20:40:40 <ogra_> heartsmagic, testimonials are  not mandatory, but your wikipage doesnt really list much we can checkm the wikipage of your locoteam neither etc

 20:40:53 <highvoltage> heartsmagic: ok, it's up to you though. thanks for joining the meeting today.

 20:41:03 <ogra_> testimonials would weight out the lacking bits for sure

 20:41:26 <heartsmagic> ok your call again

 20:41:34 <ogra_> no, yours

 20:41:39 <ogra_> give us more info

 20:41:47 <heartsmagic> more info?

 20:41:48 <ogra_> and show up in the next meeting

 20:41:52 <czajkowski> #endmeeting
