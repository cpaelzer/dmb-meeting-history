 12:05:32 <Pendulum> Welcome to the 12:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 12:06:07 <Pendulum> We will go through applications in the order they were added to the wiki. When we get to your application, please introduce yourself a little including your wiki and launchpage pages. Good luck everyone!

 12:06:43 <Pendulum> Okay, it looks like the first applicant isn't here

 12:06:58 <Pendulum> inashdeen: You're up. Please introduce yourself.

 12:07:29 <inashdeen> Hi, my name is Muhammad Ihsan Khalib Jaafar or simply ihsan jaafar. this is my wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/inashdeen and here is my launchpad https://launchpad.net/~inashdeen

 12:08:31 <inashdeen> I am sorry, but I have a slight anxiety disorder. Is there anything else I should elaborate?

 12:08:51 <head_victim> inashdeen: while we read over your application can you tell us a little about your recent works.

 12:09:22 <head_victim> I notice a lot of your wiki page is detailing projects outside the Ubuntu sphere so perhaps you can highlight some of the Ubuntu specific contributions

 12:10:05 <inashdeen> Just before my examinations, I just finished on my Jawi Keyboard Layout. First of all, Jawi is the keyboard layout for traditional malay. A friend of mine shared on our facebook that there is no Ubuntu alternatives for this. So I built one

 12:11:15 <inashdeen> My second prime contribution is on Ubuntu malay translation. I am now the deputy head for translation. So far, we manage to finish 10,000 translation in 30 days

 12:12:12 <inashdeen> My latest, which is not detailed in the wiki in my involvement on a survey soon will be done to see how Malaysian accepting Ubuntu so far

 12:12:59 <head_victim> It looks like you recently moved from Malaysia to Egypt, have you been able to connect to the Egypt team?

 12:13:50 <inashdeen> Yes, I do. I made friends like Mr. Toulan ( he notes a comment on my recommendations). I even when for their release party. But due to language barrier, I prefer working with Ubuntu-my

 12:16:13 <Pendulum> inashdeen: we've noticed that much of your translations work has been in the past couple months. What were you doing with Ubuntu before that?

 12:16:16 <head_victim> inashdeen: so one of the requirements of membership is to show significant and sustained contirbutions, a lot of your contributions seem to be fairly recent. Do you have much going back 3 - 6 months ago

 12:16:56 <inashdeen> I wrote several e-books and tutorial regarding Ubuntu, for a while. I will give those.

 12:18:30 <inashdeen> this is a tutorial I did to use lowratevoip on Ubuntu http://wiki.ubuntu.com.my/Tutorial_Menggunakan_lowratevoip_dalam_Ubuntu . Most malaysians in egypt called to malaysia. Hence, This knowledge is important for us if new Malaysian users would like to use lowratevoip on ubuntu

 12:19:37 <inashdeen> this is another e-book i wrote on how to modify ubuntu to have more effects http://wiki.ubuntu.com.my/Tutorial_Menggunakan_lowratevoip_dalam_Ubuntu

 12:19:39 <inashdeen> sorry

 12:20:14 <inashdeen> I am sorry,but apparently the book was removed from mediafire.

 12:20:17 <head_victim> inashdeen: sorry, we're not ignoring you just having some discussions behind doors.

 12:21:08 <inashdeen> here is another tutorial I wrote about why Ubuntu is better than Mint, http://wiki.ubuntu.com.my/Pro_dan_cons_Mint_berbanding_Ubuntu

 12:21:46 <inashdeen> My involvement in Remaja Linux ( or Malaysian Linux Teen ) is now roughly a year. And most of our discussion, revolves around Ubuntu.

 12:24:32 <head_victim> inashdeen: just to give you some feedback, we're thinking you're doing some great work currently but looking to ensure it's been sustained

 12:25:06 <inashdeen> I am :). previously, I am doing mostly on ground. that is before I got mentored.

 12:25:34 <inashdeen> I am doing continous contributions, the problem is, it was never documented. That is why most of the things were recent

 12:26:28 <Pendulum> inashdeen: is there anyone from an Ubuntu team you've worked with who can poke their head in to say how long they've been working with you?

 12:26:28 <inashdeen> Like I built Lexa Download Manager, Zekr Bug Fixes. That was all around more than a year. and Open book database. My contributions, despite not systematic was continous and I pledge to continue

 12:26:39 <inashdeen> can I call somebody?

 12:27:05 <hggdh> in

 12:27:11 <hggdh> yes

 12:27:45 <inashdeen> hotfloppy:

 12:28:29 <hotfloppy> inashdeen, ya.

 12:28:52 <inashdeen> They just would like to see if you could second on my contribtuons on Malaysia Loco Team

 12:29:00 <Pendulum> hotfloppy: inashdeen is going for Ubuntu membership. Can you tell us a little about how you've worked with him and for how long?

 12:29:53 <hotfloppy> Pendulum, yes sure.

 12:31:01 <hotfloppy> inashdeen is one of our (Ubuntu-MY) main contributor mostly in translator team, helping others with their issue regarding Ubuntu as Ubuntu just recently got popular here in Malaysia.

 12:31:32 <head_victim> hotfloppy: do you have any examples of his work on ubuntu going back more than a month? His launchpad karma shows activity only for the last month and not much prior to that

 12:31:59 <mfauzirahman> I know inashdeen from https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntumy/

 12:32:52 <mfauzirahman> he did create some docs for reference for our ubuntu member...https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntumy/files/ (Ihsan Salam is his fabcebook name)

 12:33:37 <hotfloppy> head_victim, yeah. Hold on k

 12:34:07 <inashdeen> head_victim : how bout Linux winter campaign? that has been going on for a 10 months

 12:34:31 <head_victim> inashdeen: is that Ubuntu related or general Linux work?

 12:34:32 <inashdeen> I distributed free Linux CDs ( Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04)

 12:35:08 <inashdeen> and sometimes, Ubuntu derivatives like Sabily since Sabily is ubuntu for muslim and my focus in on Religious studies student

 12:35:47 <hotfloppy> inashdeen, don't forget your beautiful Intel-like Ubuntu sticker during those campaign :)

 12:35:59 <inashdeen> thank you :)

 12:38:27 <head_victim> I think you are doing some awesome work but I can't see that it's been sustained as per the requirements. If you were to come back in 2 -3 months time with documentation of your continued efforts I would be more than happy to +1 then I think

 12:39:28 <meetingology> Deadlock, casting vote may be used

 12:39:30 <inashdeen> ok, thank you very much for the time :) Would try harder next time.

 12:39:51 <head_victim> inashdeen: I think you're trying hard now so don't be too disheartened. As long as it's continued for a while you'll be a shoe in

 12:39:58 <hggdh> inashdeen: please add examples of older work on your wiki

 12:40:09 <head_victim> It's just hard for us when the documentation only really shows activity for a month.

 12:40:18 <Pendulum> inashdeen: We really spent quite a bit of time discussing this. All we really need to see is more documentation showing sustained contribution to Ubuntu projects (not just general Linux projects)

 12:40:32 <Pendulum> So do please come back in a few months!

 12:40:35 <inashdeen> ok, I accept it with open heart

 12:40:45 <Pendulum> okay, next up

 12:40:57 <Pendulum> x1k: Please introduce yourself

 12:41:00 <x1k> LaunchPad: https://launchpad.net/~l.caputo

 12:41:01 <x1k> Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LCaputo

 12:41:04 <x1k> Good morning board members, my name is Luke Caputo. I turn 26 next week and have been an Ubuntu and Open Source enthusiast since 2005. My contributions to Ubuntu have been almost entirely to the community projects, as I am not a confident developer quite yet. However, I am involved in testing new proposed releases. I am incredibly interested in Ubuntu development, so I will be pushing hard in that direction soon. I also plan to

 12:41:05 <head_victim> inashdeen: and if you're not sure how you're going please feel free to drop us a line and we can give you feedback

 12:41:45 <head_victim> x1k: Never fear, community work is important as well. I am never likely to be a Ubuntu developer but still find ways to contribute

 12:41:47 <ejat> sorry ..

 12:42:44 <x1k> I am currently working on converting and recruiting some members to strengthen the PA LoCo team in my area. Due to the nature of my job, I often jump around states often, but since I am in PA for a good long time (hopefully), I would like to see more support and members in my area.

 12:43:09 <head_victim> x1k: your wiki page says a lot about what you've planned to do or what you hope to do, do you have any documentation about what you have done to date?

 12:43:38 <x1k> A local Penn State affiliate apparently has a good IT program, so I am currently petitioning students to jump on the bandwagon

 12:44:52 <x1k> head_victim: The vast majority of my work is in IRC. Though, I sometimes work with the Bug Squad andsome other groups on Launchpad.. It's not my strong skills by any means though.

 12:45:09 <head_victim> x1k: and is there anyone who is able to vouch for these contributions?

 12:45:40 <x1k> I created my Launchpad in 2008, and there is some history within my karma.

 12:46:58 <x1k> Unfortunately, no. I have asked people that I have helped in IRC to add a 'thank you' or testimony to my Wiki, but that hasn't quite received the response that I was hoping for.

 12:47:19 <Pendulum> x1k: Is there anyone who has seen your work on IRC who you could invite in here now to support you?

 12:47:31 <hggdh> x1k: which channels in IRC are you mostly active?

 12:48:02 <x1k> I can send out some feelers to see!

 12:49:00 <Pendulum> x1k: Why do you want to be an Ubuntu Member?

 12:49:10 <head_victim> x1k: which channels do you do your best work in?

 12:50:09 <ejat> x1k: are u actively join the Pennsylvania loco activity ?

 12:50:27 <x1k> #ubuntu is my primary channel of support, although recently I have diverted some of my efforts to AskUbuntu since I believe that it is a more new-user-friendly method of obtaining support

 12:51:04 <x1k> Not to take for IRC AT ALL, but a lot of brand new users have never heard of IRC.

 12:51:36 <x1k> I have been a member of PA LoCo since 2008, when I started my Launchpad account.

 12:52:24 <x1k> Pendulum: Ubuntu Membership is important to me because I want to continue to support an AWESOME community.

 12:53:20 <x1k> As I slowly start to get into development, I hope that my contributions will be much larger in the sense of contribution to the project.

 12:53:38 <Pendulum> x1k: I know you've been in the LP team for 4 years, but have you actually worked with them on anything? Or gone to any events?

 12:53:48 <Pendulum> sorry, that was regarding the PA LoCo

 12:53:55 <x1k> Once again, not taking from the validity of contribution to IRC, AT ALL.

 12:54:42 <Myrtti> x1k: what nickname have you been using in #ubuntu mostly?

 12:55:07 <x1k> I live in rural PA, many hours away from anything worth going to.. And while I lived out of state, my participation has been limited.

 12:56:07 <x1k> Which is why a local LoCo within PA LoCo is something that I am pushing hard for. We have a lot of potential in the area, but everything Ubuntu, Linux, and Open Source is 5+ hours away.

 12:56:35 <x1k> Myrtti: Oh the nick issue... I am a man of many names :-)

 12:57:17 <Myrtti> x1k: it's a bit difficult to verify your contributions in #ubuntu if you use many nicknames :-/

 12:57:23 <x1k> x1k, xlukasx, lukas, x1karr0usx, xikarrousx, ikarrous.. after that, I have no idea what handles I have used, unfortunately

 12:58:28 <hggdh> I am all for anonimity, but I am also for consistency. I cannot verify your work

 12:58:36 <head_victim> x1k: the problem we're having is proving significant and sustained contributions when there are no testimonials and no real significant history on launchpad.

 12:58:59 <Myrtti> or on IRC logs

 12:59:05 <x1k> If someone had an issue, it was dealt with through '/msg'.. up until recently when I tried searching through IRC logs on old nicks and realized that support via '/msg' is bad practice

 12:59:44 <x1k> If that is your consensus, then I will rejoin the board at a later date, hopefully with someone to back me up.

 12:59:56 <head_victim> x1k: ah then of course we're not going to be able to find it. What I'd suggest then is to make sure you do all your contributions in the public from now on and show a sustained contribution that way and return when there is a bit of history.

 13:00:41 <x1k> However, I have been contributing a ton of my free time to Ubuntu user support for the the past 5-6 years.

 13:00:53 <Pendulum> #vote x1k's application for Ubuntu membership

 13:00:54 <meetingology> Please vote on: x1k's application for Ubuntu membership

 13:00:54 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (private votes don't work yet, but when they do it will be by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0 to me)

 13:01:25 <mfauzirahman> -1

 13:01:28 <hggdh> -1 no verifiable sustained contributions for Ubuntu

 13:01:28 <meetingology> -1 no verifiable sustained contributions for Ubuntu received from hggdh

 13:01:42 <head_victim> -1 for now, if you can return in 3 months with some verified contributions I'd be more than happy to change that

 13:01:42 <meetingology> -1 for now, if you can return in 3 months with some verified contributions I'd be more than happy to change that received from head_victim

 13:01:50 <head_victim> mfauzirahman: only board members can vote sorry.

 13:02:27 <Pendulum> -1 Please come back in a few months when you can show some varifiable sustained contribution.

 13:02:27 <meetingology> -1 Please come back in a few months when you can show some varifiable sustained contribution. received from Pendulum

 13:02:39 <x1k> Thank you for using the keyword "verifiable", as to not take from my contributions

 13:02:51 <mfauzirahman> sorry

 13:03:06 <head_victim> x1k: if you help out in #ubuntu I'm sure you'll get to know the regulars and when you apply next time ask them to give you a testimonial.

 13:03:34 <cyphermox> +0, abstaining; but agreeing with others

 13:03:34 <meetingology> +0, abstaining; but agreeing with others received from cyphermox

 13:03:36 <x1k> And my karma history does not give me any credit as having contributed since 2008?

 13:03:47 <Pendulum> #endvote

 13:03:47 <meetingology> Voting ended on: x1k's application for Ubuntu membership

 13:03:47 <meetingology> Votes for:0 Votes against:3 Abstentions:1

 13:03:47 <meetingology> Motion denied

 13:03:55 <head_victim> x1k: as board members we work closely with all groups so we are able to rely on testimonials

 13:04:00 <cyphermox> x1k: well actually, karma does expire, but there is other ways to get history

 13:04:13 <head_victim> So if you were to get testimonials from other #ubuntu regulars we'd be able to verify the support :)

 13:04:13 <hggdh> x1k: no, unfortunately. I also searched for bugs from you,m and got 8 bugs back

 13:04:25 <x1k> cyphermox: right, but the history of contributions are still visable.

 13:04:36 <cyphermox> x1k: yes :)

 13:04:42 <Pendulum> x1k: but they're not the contributions you're using to get membership.

 13:05:21 <Pendulum> anyway, that is it for this meeting.
