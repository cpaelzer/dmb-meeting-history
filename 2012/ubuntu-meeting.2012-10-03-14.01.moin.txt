 14:09:48 <balloons> nice

 14:09:49 * smartboyhw too

 14:09:52 <balloons> anything else to share?

 14:10:02 <smartboyhw> balloons, sorry for not donating. Don't have money:P

 14:10:11 <balloons> the rest of it is straightforward.. it's crunch time for the images

 14:10:21 <balloons> smartboyhw, no worries.. showing up is also a help

 14:10:24 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:10:35 <balloons> try and get some non-std installations done if you can :-)

 14:10:46 <balloons> that was my secondary goal for the 24 hours

 14:10:53 * smartboyhw will test Ubuntu Studio that day then:P

 14:11:33 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:13:29 <balloons> [TOPIC] Other Updates

 14:13:35 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:13:53 <balloons> I know phillw, wxl and others have all been working on the ppc iso's to try and land one for the final release of quantal

 14:14:03 <balloons> it's been quite a ride with some hard to solve bugs

 14:14:17 <balloons> anything else people wish to share?

 14:14:18 <smartboyhw> Yay

 14:14:19 <balloons> smartboyhw, go ahead

 14:14:19 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:14:21 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:14:29 <smartboyhw> A bit of report and a bit of question:P

 14:14:52 <smartboyhw> The Ubuntu Studio testcase is gonna get done at 10th (I set a deadline).

 14:15:28 <smartboyhw> balloons, stupid question: In http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-quality-community-testing.html

 14:15:46 <smartboyhw> 76% with red light:P er are you going to fix that?:P

 14:16:51 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:17:08 <balloons> I've done my part :-) http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/u/nskaggs.html

 14:17:17 <smartboyhw> Oh;P

 14:17:42 <smartboyhw> BTW another thing: Someone remove http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ from the QA meeting page, it is clearly outdated with no 2012 logs

 14:17:58 <balloons> lol -- yes, it needs to be finished out

 14:18:12 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:18:27 <smartboyhw> OK I'm done

 14:18:27 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:18:43 <balloons> we're a bit behind overall: http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/

 14:19:21 * smartboyhw is happy Ubuntu Studio got 92% and Lubuntu got 89% so we are not gonna be blamed:P

 14:21:00 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:22:28 <smartboyhw> Er balloons nothing to add.....:P

 14:23:05 * balloons just noting

 14:23:06 <balloons> There are 11 days left in the current cycle. That means that in order to complete all the work 83.91 workitems must be completed per day.

 14:23:21 <balloons> I'm sure this Friday's meeting will be interesting

 14:23:30 <balloons> we should see sometype of drop

 14:23:38 <smartboyhw> Yeah......

 14:23:43 <balloons> Ok, so anyone else?

 14:23:45 <balloons> anything elsE?

 14:23:50 <phillw> we are quietly confident that PPC will ship as both desktop & alternate, using release notes.

 14:24:00 <smartboyhw> *quite:P

 14:24:04 <balloons> that's good news phillw

 14:24:04 <smartboyhw> yay

 14:25:28 <balloons> alright, if that's it, well that's it ;-) Again, I hope to see everyone tomorrow. Should be a fun time -- try and make QA part of your day

 14:25:34 <smartboyhw> ;-)
