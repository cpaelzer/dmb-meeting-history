 14:02:35 <seb128> hey

 14:02:39 <stgraber> hey seb128

 14:02:41 <jibel> hi

 14:02:46 <stgraber> #topic Action items review

 14:02:47 <skaet> hi

 14:02:54 <stgraber> xnox to liase with ballons, gema and jibel w.r.t. fs/storage testing

 14:02:59 <stgraber> xnox: there by any chance?

 14:03:10 <jibel> no news from xnox

 14:03:13 <xnox> nope

 14:03:28 <xnox> but there is progress in utah development, such that this testing can be now feasible

 14:03:40 <xnox> will do this next week.

 14:03:50 <xnox> ..

 14:03:50 <stgraber> ok, cool

 14:03:56 <stgraber> Flavor leads participating, please verify that the images are as you

 14:03:56 <stgraber> expect, and start smoke testing tomorrow to make sure all the right

 14:03:57 <stgraber> 12.04.1 bits are in place.

 14:04:03 <stgraber> skaet: did you get any feedback on that?

 14:04:28 <skaet> yup,  flavors started testing last Friday,  results coming in

 14:04:55 <skaet> not heard of any nasty surprises from them.

 14:05:07 <skaet> ..

 14:05:11 <stgraber> good to hear

 14:05:18 <stgraber> #topic Review of upcoming deadlines

 14:05:23 <stgraber> - today 21:00 UTC: KernelFreeze, LanguageTranslationDeadline, SRU Fix Validation Testing

 14:05:26 <stgraber> - 2012/08/16: FinalFreeze, ReleaseNoteFreeze

 14:05:29 <stgraber> - 2012/08/23: Ubuntu 12.04.1

 14:06:20 <stgraber> The plan is to switch images to building from -updates today, though we'll need quite a few more tricks to have them really usable, so it might have to wait till tomorrow or we'll be building an oversized batch with broken upgrade path

 14:06:59 <stgraber> #topic Quick look through the current bug lists, checking for progress.

 14:07:05 <stgraber> Not going to paste stats this time as it's not as relevant at this stage.

 14:07:10 <stgraber> Verification and fixes of any detected regression should be the main focus at this point.

 14:07:20 <stgraber> We're at least still waiting on maas and eglibc at this point, these need to be in -proposed by 21:00 UTC today at the latest and might still be getting their exception declined if it's considered too dangerous at this point.

 14:08:00 <stgraber> I'm currently trying to get our alternate image to allow for internet-less upgrades from 10.04 to 12.04, this might require some extra shuffling and uploading later today

 14:08:57 <stgraber> as a general rule, if you want something in 12.04.1, upload it to the queue. It's easier for us to then review it here and grant or decline the exception. Poking #ubuntu-release might also make things go a bit faster (if we missed an upload)

 14:09:51 <stgraber> any critical bugs that need some hilighting?

 14:10:55 <stgraber> taking that as a no

 14:11:00 <stgraber> #topic Media oversizedness

 14:11:25 <stgraber> The recent live-build fixes have made both amd64 and amd64+mac fit again

 14:11:39 <smartboyhw> Yeah!

 14:11:49 <stgraber> i386 will need some fixing as it's including an extra langpack making it oversized at the moment

 14:12:04 <stgraber> a simple seed change didn't do the trick, so we'll likely need to hack it around in live-build

 14:12:22 <stgraber> I'll be looking into that once I'm done fixing the upgrade bug

 14:12:37 <skaet> :)

 14:12:56 <stgraber> As far as I know, all the other images currently fit, so unless some packages in -proposed got a big size increase, we should be fine

 14:13:06 <stgraber> #topic Round table

 14:13:13 <stgraber> stgraber@castiana:~$ echo $(shuf -e NCommander seb128 stgraber stokachu arges jibel skaet smoser jamespage)

 14:13:16 <stgraber> stokachu NCommander seb128 skaet stgraber arges jamespage smoser jibel

 14:13:18 <stgraber> stokachu:

 14:14:15 <stgraber> NCommander: then

 14:14:24 <smoser> o/

 14:15:30 <stgraber> seb128:

 14:15:33 <seb128> hey

 14:15:39 <seb128> nothing special, we are hard frozen

 14:15:53 <seb128> a compiz SRU was uploaded to fix the arm* build issue from the one currently in proposed

 14:16:05 <seb128> discussion is ongoing on the release list about whoopsie on or off

 14:16:15 <seb128> otherwise we pushing some fixes to .2

 14:16:22 <seb128> we are mostly good at this point I think

 14:16:23 <seb128> ..

 14:17:04 <stgraber> ok. I guess you'll want to do some poking in #ubuntu-release to get that compiz upload in

 14:17:08 <stgraber> skaet:

 14:17:22 <skaet> Daily images will be switching from being built based on  -proposed to being built based on -updates after 2100 today.

 14:17:31 <skaet> Release Note framework and initial edit for 12.04.1 set up was done.

 14:17:43 <skaet> Release Notes are available for updates now.   Fixed bugs have been pruned out and the original 12.04 versions have been archived off.   Plan this time around is to make the release notes reflective of the 12.04.1 image, and include changelogs.   To make edits (adding bugs, documenting new features added since 12.04),  please edit the appropriate wiki linked to from: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseN

 14:17:43 <skaet> otes

 14:17:43 <skaet> For example: if there is a new server feature for 12.04.1,  a note should go into: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuServer  (the original version for 12.04 is at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuServer/UbuntuServer-12.04)

 14:17:47 <skaet> ..

 14:18:43 <stgraber> stokachu:

 14:18:45 <stgraber> oops

 14:18:47 <stgraber> stgraber:

 14:18:55 <skaet> :)

 14:19:25 <stgraber> right, so I've been working on that upgrade bug with slangasek yesterday. I managed to get it working locally but now we need to achieve the same miracle with the alternate media.

 14:19:42 <stgraber> Will continue on that today, then look at fixing the langpack list on the i386 daily-live

 14:20:09 <stgraber> I also have a bunch more verification to do as the list is kind of long at this point

 14:20:48 <stgraber> then maybe I'll even find the time to look at the usb-creator verification failure, though I don't consider this 12.04.1 critical at this point, so if it's easy to fix, good, otherwise, will just postpone

 14:20:54 <stgraber> arges:

 14:21:10 <arges> I setup the cronjob to upload the point release page

 14:21:23 <arges> http://people.canonical.com/~arges/point-release/milestone-12.04.1.html

 14:21:41 <arges> Submitted code to arsenal, hope to get things on cranberry and also start putting up pages for 12.04.2

 14:21:45 <arges> ..

 14:21:56 <arges> oh

 14:22:00 <arges> still waiting on http://launchpad.net/bugs/979003

 14:22:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 979003 in eglibc (Ubuntu Quantal) "libc incorrectly detects AVX support" [High,In progress]

 14:22:02 <arges> ..

 14:22:19 <stgraber> yeah... infinity said we'd get it uploaded today...

 14:22:34 <stgraber> jamespage:

 14:23:11 <jamespage> so most server stuff is looking ok; the only straggler being walinuxagent which is currently stuck in the precise-propsed NEW queue

 14:23:28 <jamespage> this is required for enablement of the azure IaaS platform

 14:23:48 <jamespage> other than that I've been repointing stuff that won't make it to -updates

 14:23:54 <jamespage> I'll let smoser cover maas

 14:23:56 <jamespage> ..

 14:24:09 <smoser> there are not going to be any updates to maas for 12.04.1

 14:25:41 <stgraber> good to hear ;)

 14:25:47 <stgraber> smoser:

 14:26:24 <smoser> i have nothing else really.

 14:26:35 <smoser> i woudl say ther eis an outside chance at having a cloud-init change in today

 14:26:40 <smoser> but that is low likelyhood.

 14:27:14 <stgraber> ok

 14:27:29 <stgraber> jibel:

 14:27:37 <jibel> Focus on upgrade testing:

 14:27:43 <jibel> * defects found with automated tests are mostly obsolete configuration files. I don't know if they are all harmless so I reported a few for desktop and server:

 14:28:49 <jibel> * I've been hit by bug 979661 during an upgrade from Oneiric (debconf failed to load GTK). It seems to occur rather frequently. but need latest update-manager to verify the workaround really works

 14:28:51 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 979661 in update-manager (Ubuntu Quantal) "oneiric to precise: debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Gnome and falls back to Dialog" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/979661

 14:29:02 <jibel> bug 1034794: if someone from foundations could have a look

 14:29:02 <jibel> bug 1034668: for the desktop team

 14:29:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1034794 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "10.04 -> 12.04 upgrade should remove live-initramfs" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1034794

 14:29:19 <jibel> todo:

 14:29:26 <jibel> * verification of bug 1029531 in progress but failing at the moment, waiting for openoffice to be accepted and seeded.

 14:29:26 <jibel> furthermore the CD contains update-manager 0.156.14 instead of 0.156.14.8 (-proposed) or .6 (-updates)

 14:29:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1029531 in update-manager (Ubuntu Precise) "cdromupgrade from Lucid to Precise failed with unmet dependencies without network connection" [Critical,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1029531

 14:29:42 <jibel> One request:

 14:29:47 <jibel> Would it be possible to update UpgraderTool in http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release-development to point to the version in precise-updates (or better precise-proposed) if that makes sense ?

 14:29:54 <jibel> It currently points to the version from the release pocket and makes testing versions from proposed and updates a bit harder, and people who are currently upgrading to precise with -d doesn't use the latest version.

 14:30:05 <jibel> Installation smoke testing;

 14:30:05 <jibel> Nothing found for the moment.

 14:30:08 <jibel> ..

 14:30:42 <skaet> jibel,  we'll be switching the builds to be from -updates later today,  so probably not make sense to switch now.

 14:30:55 <skaet> however,  something to note for 12.04.2

 14:31:10 <stgraber> mvo: ^

 14:32:14 <skaet> ..

 14:32:18 <jibel> skaet, will that pull the release-upgrader from -updates too ? because currently for example alternate is built with packages from -proposed but the upgrader is from -release

 14:32:29 <slangasek> switching to -updates today?  I thought the switch wasn't meant to be until we're farther along with the SRU promotion?

 14:33:26 <skaet> slangasek,  schedule discussed was we'd be switching the dailies to be built from -updates today,  rather than -proposed,  to ready for final freeze.

 14:33:36 <slangasek> hmm

 14:33:51 <slangasek> except that means no more image-based testing of the stuff that's currently in -proposed and not ready for promotion

 14:34:03 <slangasek> and since we're iterating CD upgrade fixes, that's rather significant

 14:34:13 <skaet> hmm..

 14:34:21 <slangasek> perhaps we should push back the switch?

 14:34:30 <stgraber> yeah, that's why I said earlier that I'm not going to do the switch until we have a test image that upgrades fine and isn't oversized

 14:35:13 <slangasek> ok

 14:35:31 <skaet> lets discuss further in #ubuntu-release then after the meeting.

 14:35:32 <stgraber> I don't necessarily mind regressing with the switch to -updates as long as I know that the fixes in -proposed are correct and will indeed fix the image when they land (or the SRU team can decide to let them through to -updates before the 7 days)

 14:36:09 <stgraber> #topic AOB

 14:38:19 <stgraber> ok, let's get back to work :)

 14:38:21 <stgraber> #endmeeting
