 12:08:12 <head_victim> So, please bear with us, we have a few new board members so it may take a little longer than normal but we'll get there :)

 12:10:00 <head_victim> Ok

 12:10:24 <head_victim> #meetingtopic 1200 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 12:10:53 <head_victim> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards#A12:00

 12:11:47 <head_victim> #topic gipsypyaesone - Membership Application

 12:12:46 <head_victim> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 27/06/2012. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:12:46 <head_victim> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:12:47 <head_victim> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:12:50 <head_victim> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:12:54 <head_victim> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:12:58 <head_victim> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:13:02 <head_victim> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 12:13:15 <head_victim> So it doesn't appear gypsyaesone is here, we might move along to the second applicant.

 12:14:05 <head_victim> #topic jaddi27 - Joel Addison's Membership Application

 12:14:35 <jaddi27> Hello. My name is Joel Addison. I am a software engineering student from Brisbane, Australia, who is very interested in Ubuntu and open source software. I have been a member of the Ubuntu Australian Team for several years now, and have helped out with various activities

 12:14:37 <head_victim> Joel, can you please introduce yourself to the board while we read over your application

 12:15:31 <jaddi27> My main contribution has been through translations, where I have completed around 50,000 strings for en_AU over the past few months along with sagaci

 12:16:09 <head_victim> As one of the people one the page as a testimonial I will say jaddi27 has been one of the more active members in the loco

 12:16:19 <cjohnston> just 50,000? ;-)  Thats about 50,000 more than me. heh

 12:16:33 <cjohnston> awesome work on translations

 12:16:34 <head_victim> cjohnston: another loco member did over 200k from memory ;)

 12:16:39 <cjohnston> wow

 12:16:40 <jaddi27> It is still about 150,000 less than sagaci

 12:17:26 <IdleOne> jaddi27: Why haven't you done more translation? :)

 12:17:33 <head_victim> jaddi27: so what are you plans for the next 6 months with regards to your Ubuntu work.

 12:17:48 <IdleOne> ignore my question it was silly anyway

 12:17:52 <jaddi27> IdleOne, I would have done a few more if Uni had not crept up on me over the past few weeks

 12:18:27 <jaddi27> Over the next 6 months I hope to continue with the translations, to keep the Q-series mostly up to date as the translations come in

 12:18:50 <jaddi27> I also plan to keep helping out in the loco, with chairing meetings and moderating the social media pages

 12:18:50 <Pendulum> jaddi27: You mention in your future goals that you'd like to get involved in bug fixing. Is this something you're already working on or something you're looking to start doing?

 12:19:31 <jaddi27> I am looking to start doing more program development and bug fixing now that I am more confident in my ability to use the languages often used in Ubuntu applications

 12:20:02 <jaddi27> I was thinking of entering the competition being run at the moment, but unfortunately did not have enough time with Uni and work

 12:20:57 <jaddi27> I would like to look at creating a calendar and todo app that can be integrated with the calendar in the time menu

 12:21:23 <head_victim> Ok, anymore questions?

 12:21:28 <IdleOne> I have to get going folks. Congrats to all the new members in advance. For the record I am +1 for jaddi27 to be an Ubuntu member..

 12:21:33 <cyphermox> jaddi27: feel free to ask me questui

 12:24:24 <head_victim> #topic jamesh - James Henstridge's Membership Application

 12:24:40 <jamesh> Hi.  My name is James Henstridge, and my wiki page is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JamesHenstridge

 12:25:36 <jamesh> I've been working for Canonical since 2004, on various things: I did a bit of desktop work back in the first release, then worked on Launchpad, and now work on Ubuntu One

 12:26:19 <head_victim> Gday jamesh, very strong application but no testimonials. Is there anyone coming along in person to support?

 12:27:04 <jamesh> head_victim: I asked a few of my colleagues about testimonials, but it doesn't look like they got round to adding them :(

 12:27:08 <cjohnston> jamesh has done alot of great work on things that I use on a regular basis when it comes to sites like summit.ubuntu.com and loco.ubuntu.com... btw, jamesh django-openid-auth 0.4 was uploaded to Debian this morning!

 12:27:33 <jamesh> cjohnston: cool!

 12:28:22 <jamesh> outside of my work responsibilities, I've also been answering questions on the Ask Ubuntu site in my spare time, and do some other software development (some of which is packaged in Ubuntu)

 12:29:05 <jamesh> I've been teaching myself Debian packaging too, so plan to continue with that and maybe get a few of my other small projects in a state where they could be added to Ubuntu

 12:29:22 <e-jat> jamesh : aw3s0m3

 12:31:35 <head_victim> jamesh: while we're reading through pages, have you thought about getting involved in the loco at all?

 12:32:34 <jamesh> head_victim: I haven't really investigated it much.  I do attend PLUG meetings when I've got time, but that isn't strictly Ubuntu related

 12:33:03 <head_victim> jamesh: that's not a problem, we're not that exclusive :) I'm trying to get HUMBUG to join up and do things as well.

 12:33:15 <jamesh> I did give a talk there about some of the stuff we'd been doing in U1 last year

 12:33:55 <head_victim> Nice work, if you ever need materials for events give me a ping (I'm the team contact ;) ) and we can try to organise stuff to make it more fun.

 12:34:16 <jamesh> head_victim: I have mentioned to them that it might be worth trying to form some kind of affiliation though: there are a fair number of Ubuntu and Debian users there to help people

 12:34:47 <head_victim> jamesh: sounds good, if ever there are any events sing out and I can shoot you over some CDs, banners, etc.

 12:35:41 <jamesh> okay

 12:38:00 <head_victim> jamesh: basically your application is thorough and well documented, but we really do like to see some sort of testimonial on the wiki or in the meeting

 12:40:28 <head_victim> jamesh: if we put it off until the next meeting in 2 weeks do you think you could have some people add a note or email the mailing list with a bit of support?

 12:41:45 <jamesh> head_victim: I suppose so.  But is this a hard and fast procedural thing, or do you think the application isn't sufficient?

 12:42:56 <head_victim> It's more that it's a case of I can see what you've done but as someone in a different part of the community I dont' know what's involved in it

 12:43:13 <head_victim> So testimonials are a good way to show that others in your area of the community concur.

 12:43:38 <head_victim> As an example, I have no idea if 302 answers on Ask Ubuntu is good, I think it is but really, I've used that page twice so can't be sure.

 12:45:05 <jamesh> okay.  I can certainly chase up the people I asked again.  It wasn't clear that it was a hard and fast requirement.  I did include links to things like the bugzilla->LP migration that I hoped would be evidence of what I have done

 12:46:24 <Pendulum> jamesh: Part of it is that Ubuntu Membership is a community recognition. Testimonials help us see how you are part of the community/that others see you that way.

 12:47:01 <jamesh> Pendulum: okay.

 12:50:27 <head_victim> jamesh: ok so sorry to be a pain if we can get a few testimonials we'd probably all feel a lot more comfortable. We'll also work on making the documentation more clear to explain the logic behind it.

 12:50:59 <jamesh> head_victim: I just asked aquarius if he could give a short testimonial now, if that's okay

 12:51:01 <aquarius> hey, I'm happy to give a testimonal for jamesh (am I butting in?)

 12:51:31 <head_victim> aquarius: go for it

 12:51:41 <aquarius> James is excellent. :)

 12:51:56 <head_victim> aquarius: and you've worked with him on anything in particular or day to day?

 12:52:03 <aquarius> He's part of my team at Canonical, working on Ubuntu One

 12:52:31 <aquarius> but I've also seen and used his contributions to free software outside our working lives

 12:53:16 <aquarius> the PyGTK bindings were particularly useful!

 12:53:18 <head_victim> aquarius: so his contributions to the team and Ubuntu would meet the significant and sustained requirement for membership in your opinion?

 12:53:53 <aquarius> Absolutely, yes, in my opinion jamesh's contributions are both significant and sustained, and he qualifies for Ubuntu membership.

 12:54:01 <head_victim> aquarius: thanks so much for your help :)

 12:54:06 <aquarius> No problem. :)

 12:54:42 <e-jat> tq aquarius for your opinion and testimonial :)

 12:54:44 <cjohnston> thanks aquarius

 12:55:03 <dholbach> I'd echo aquarius' statement: James has been around since almost forever in the Ubuntu project, working on Launchpad, Ubuntu One and small pieces all over the place and he has always been super-helpful and is generally just a great guy! :)

 12:55:14 <head_victim> dholbach: greatly appreciate your input

 12:55:18 <dholbach> (sorry for jumping in here, but I had no idea jamesh was up for membership :-))

 12:55:25 <cyphermox> let's vote :)

 12:55:27 <Pendulum> aquarius, dholbach: thanks for speaking up!

 12:55:45 <e-jat> http://askubuntu.com/users/12469/james-henstridge can see jamesh contribution â€¦

 12:55:47 <jamesh> thanks aquarius, dholbach!

 12:55:51 <head_victim> dholbach: please do, we were umming and arring as there were no testimonials now we have 3 so I think we can probably get this going now

 12:56:02 <dholbach> :-)

 13:00:51 <head_victim> #topic  MohamedAlaa98 Mohamed Alaa's Ubuntu Membership Application

 13:01:01 <head_victim> MohamedAlaa98: pelase introduce yourself while we read the application

 13:01:06 <MohamedAlaa98> Hi. My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MohamedAlaa

 13:01:06 <MohamedAlaa98> and My launchpad profile is https://launchpad.net/~m-alaa8

 13:01:22 <MohamedAlaa98> My name is Mohamed Alaa, Egyptinan, 13 YO, Python programmer, Ubuntu translator, Bug triager, Community contributer, ubuntu-eg support squad, I give support on ubuntu-eg facebook group and I'm trying hard to spread ubuntu everywhere.

 13:02:00 <MohamedAlaa98> Outside community, i'm currently working on a Python project named indicator-prayer-times, as well as I have learned packaging python projects through launchpad nest-packaging.

 13:02:09 <head_victim> Well at 13 I wouldn't have even been able to work out how to sign the CoC so that's a good start

 13:02:22 <MohamedAlaa98> thanks :)

 13:02:37 <MohamedAlaa98> I respect and follow free software philosophy and I advocate open-source and free software whenever possible.

 13:02:53 <thelinuxer> hi I am here to testify for him, so please tell me when it's time to do so :)

 13:03:27 <head_victim> thelinuxer: so young MohamedAlaa98 is fairly active in the loco?

 13:03:34 <thelinuxer> yes he is

 13:03:43 <thelinuxer> I am actually amazed by his level of activity

 13:03:52 <thelinuxer> his answers and trouble shooting skills

 13:03:57 <e-jat> thelinuxer : im amaze too :)

 13:04:04 <head_victim> And it's been sustained for a while?

 13:04:11 <thelinuxer> and actually I think a good number of our group members ask him directly for help

 13:04:21 <thelinuxer> yes it's been sustained

 13:04:47 <thelinuxer> he also showed he's a good team player by working on a development project with another team member

 13:05:00 <thelinuxer> I really think he's talented and dedicated and I expect a lot from him in the future if he's encouraged to go to the right direction.

 13:05:23 <thelinuxer> I am done :)

 13:05:27 <head_victim> thelinuxer: It's good to see the -eg team taking him in and giving him direction :)

 13:05:30 <e-jat> thanks thelinuxer

 13:05:39 <MohamedAlaa98> thelinuxer: thank you for your support :)

 13:05:42 <thelinuxer> head_victim: we are trying :)

 13:05:49 <thelinuxer> MohamedAlaa98: yw :)

 13:06:12 <Pendulum> MohamedAlaa98: what do you do outside of your Ubuntu work?

 13:06:37 <MohamedAlaa98> i'm currently working on a Python project named indicator-prayer-times

 13:07:06 <MohamedAlaa98> and now i'm learning bug fixing

 13:07:19 <Pendulum> MohamedAlaa98: Sorry for not being clear; I meant, when you're not on the computer?

 13:07:32 <cyphermox> MohamedAlaa98: on that subject, it would be very cool to see this shipping in Ubuntu soon; since it's in a PPA already and probably working fairly well, that would be a good step forward :)

 13:07:56 <MohamedAlaa98> ah, I play football, i love to draw

 13:07:58 <thelinuxer> cyphermox: and I am actually using his application right now

 13:08:28 <MohamedAlaa98> cyphermox: I hope that :)

 13:08:32 * e-jat also looking the package will be in ubuntu universe
