 20:09:40 <gilir> thanks kanliot, let me know if there is any big problems when testing the lubuntu ISOs

 20:09:53 <kanliot> yes

 20:10:51 <gilir> #topic Unit193 - Weekly report - Update from IRC OP's team

 20:11:32 <Unit193> Had one person/problem that thought the only way to get help was to insult the channel. No training events that I know either.

 20:11:52 <Unit193> wxl handled that since he was there, did well.

 20:11:58 <gilir> nice :-/

 20:12:07 <kanliot> i was there and handled it poorly

 20:12:15 <kanliot> ;)

 20:12:29 <Myrtti> I tried my best

 20:13:03 <gilir> well it's over, let's think about other stuff :)

 20:13:38 <gilir> thanks Unit193 :) I'll switch to the next topic if there is no question

 20:13:56 <Unit193> Think that's it, unless someone else has more.

 20:14:19 <gilir> #topic kanliot - Weekly report - Update from Comms team

 20:14:36 <kanliot> hi

 20:14:52 <kanliot> for next week i'll try and get another update from mario on progress from osuosl

 20:14:55 <kanliot> end of report

 20:16:16 <gilir> thanks kanliot

 20:17:12 <gilir> #topic gilir - Weekly report - Update from Devs teams

 20:17:37 <gilir> a couple a small fixes last week

 20:18:14 <gilir> there is still one fix for 3G modem that I need to prepare

 20:18:53 <gilir> after that, it should be quiet until the release I hope ("just" testing)

 20:19:08 <gilir> any questions ?

 20:20:17 <gilir> #topic Any Other Business

 20:20:25 <micahg> o/

 20:20:33 <gilir> anything to add ?

 20:20:38 <micahg> yes :)

 20:20:42 <gilir> micahg, yes ? :)

 20:21:10 <micahg> I had a lubuntu packageset created to allow for easier tracking of build failures that affect lubuntu

 20:21:55 <gilir> micahg, ah, yes that could be nice :)

 20:22:00 <micahg> at the moment it doesn't grant upload rights, but the DMB would welcome applications from people involved in maintaining these packages

 20:22:28 <gilir> micahg, what did you included in it ?

 20:22:46 <micahg> gilir: it's auto-generated from the seeds, so should include any universe packages in lubuntu

 20:23:02 <micahg> http://people.canonical.com/~stgraber/package_sets/precise/lubuntu

 20:24:15 <gilir> micahg, thanks :)

 20:24:44 <micahg> you're welcome, I'm looking forward to reviewing DMB applications in due time from lubuntu people :)

 20:25:15 <micahg> err..applications for upload rights :)

 20:25:45 <gilir> I hope there will have some in the future :)

 20:26:00 <kanliot> what's a dmb

 20:26:02 <kanliot> ?

 20:26:10 <micahg> Developer Membership Board

 20:26:15 <kanliot> thx

 20:26:55 <gilir> kanliot, I'll prepare a mail about this, to explain with more details

 20:27:09 <gilir> it should be a source of motivation :)

 20:27:40 <gilir> anything to add before the end of the meeting ?

 20:28:32 <gilir> ok, thanks everyone :)
