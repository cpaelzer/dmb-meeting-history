 16:02:59 * jamespage passes the baton to Daviey

 16:03:08 <jamespage> (who hopefully is prepared)

 16:03:48 <Daviey> 16:00 < Daviey> (Note, i will be largely absent this time - is someone else happy to drive the dev  review?)

 16:04:02 <jamespage> lol

 16:04:03 <hallyn> Daviey: why don't you hand jamespae the url with the concerning bugs

 16:04:14 <hallyn> then i'm sure jamespage will be happy to drive

 16:04:19 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html :)

 16:04:22 <jamespage> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:04:25 <Daviey> good thinking that man!

 16:04:53 <jamespage> So whilst we review this we need to consider that Alpha 2 is due on the 2nd Feb and Beta 1 on the 16th

 16:05:01 <jamespage> ticktockticktock

 16:06:04 <jamespage> do we really just run through these?

 16:06:19 <jamespage> OK so bug 883988

 16:06:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 883988 in glance (Ubuntu Precise) "db migration failing when upgrading glance - trying to create existing tables" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/883988

 16:06:48 <zul> its on the upstream radar

 16:07:00 <jamespage> zul: when is a fix expected?

 16:08:08 <jamespage> Guess that is still in progress

 16:08:29 <jamespage> bug 911812

 16:08:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 911812 in facter (Ubuntu Precise) "processor fact does not handle arm, others" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/911812

 16:09:00 <jamespage> not sure if roaksoax is here...

 16:09:09 <adam_g> jamespage: i spoke to andres about that friday. i think that is fixed released in a number of recent releases, and should propose to lucid.

 16:09:20 <adam_g> not sure what he's found out, though

 16:09:50 <jamespage> smoser, bug 913009

 16:09:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 913009 in bacula (Ubuntu) "package bacula-common-mysql (not installed) failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/bacula/libbaccats.la', which is also in package bacula-common 5.2.1-0ubuntu2" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/913009

 16:09:59 <jamespage> progress?

 16:10:02 <smoser> hm..

 16:10:04 <smoser> no, no progress.

 16:10:34 <jamespage> adam_g: I see bug 916992 is fixed - nice one!

 16:10:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 916992 in OpenStack Compute (nova) "Database migration v064 fails against MySQL 5.5 + InnoDB" [Critical,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/916992

 16:11:12 <jamespage> SpamapS, bug 914392

 16:11:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 914392 in juju "LXC local provider does not respect 'series' (only installs oneiric)" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/914392

 16:11:31 <jamespage> any eta from the juju team on when that will be resolved?

 16:12:00 <smoser> branch is in merge queue i beleve

 16:12:13 <jamespage> great

 16:12:21 <SpamapS> jamespage: thats got a fix upstream in a branch, ready for testing

 16:12:45 <jamespage> adam_g: bug 922232 - I see that there is a fixed proposed upstream

 16:12:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922232 in OpenStack Compute (nova) "Volumes fail to attach without discovery using tgt" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922232

 16:13:02 <Ursinha> what's the importance of this bug?

 16:13:26 <adam_g> jamespage: yeah, didnt realize a QA bot had tagged it failing a unit test, pushed a second rev. last night.

 16:13:39 <adam_g> Ursinha: the tgt bug? high, i'd say

 16:13:49 <Ursinha> adam_g, may I set it?

 16:14:04 <adam_g> Ursinha: sure.

 16:14:06 <Ursinha> oh, I can't :)

 16:14:19 <adam_g> i thought i did for the ubuntu task

 16:14:27 <jamespage> adam_g: you did - thats fine

 16:14:44 <jamespage> we can't set the upstream task importance which is fair enough

 16:15:13 <Ursinha> that's fine

 16:15:23 <Ursinha> so the downstream is in progress

 16:15:43 <jamespage> Ok; bug 923681

 16:15:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 923681 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "Server install fails when selecting everything but 'VM host' & 'Manual selection' from tasksel" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/923681

 16:16:33 <jamespage> interesting that the automated testing has not picked that up because it uses tasksel (albeit through preseeds).

 16:17:48 <jamespage> bug 875262;

 16:17:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 875262 in php5 (Ubuntu Oneiric) "PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/sqlite.so'" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/875262

 16:18:08 <jamespage> currently assigned to koolhead17

 16:18:12 <jamespage> ..

 16:18:35 <SpamapS> he's been working on it

 16:18:49 <SpamapS> I've been helping him when I can

 16:19:11 <jamespage> SpamapS, think that will make alpha-2?

 16:20:10 <Daviey> SpamapS: Can you clarify what is holding it up?

 16:21:39 <jamespage> OK; lets come back to that if/when

 16:21:43 <jamespage> bug 890362

 16:21:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 890362 in nova (Ubuntu) "Should user's shell be /bin/false?" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/890362

 16:22:26 <jamespage> adam_g, zul: any thoughts on this one? It would nice to land something for alpha-2

 16:22:43 <zul> james: yeah its on my todo list

 16:22:48 <jamespage> great

 16:23:07 <SpamapS> Sorry I had something here distracting me

 16:23:14 <jamespage> np

 16:23:24 <jamespage> any feedback?

 16:23:32 <SpamapS> Whats holding it up is that koolhead17 is new to packaging, and needs guidance, and is in a very incompatible time zone with me.

 16:23:59 <arosales> zul, do you think 890362 will make alpha 2?

 16:24:01 <SpamapS> We also need to merge PHP 5.3.9 .. but thats not going to make alpha-2

 16:24:29 <jamespage> SpamapS, ack - I think Daviey and I are more compatible timewise...

 16:24:30 <zul> arosales: probably i was going to do some work on it this afternoon

 16:24:42 <jamespage> so feel free to point him in our direction

 16:24:51 <arosales> zul: ok, thanks.

 16:25:17 <jamespage> roaksoax has been working on bug 898840

 16:25:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 898840 in cobbler (Ubuntu) "'default' preseed should be enlister" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/898840

 16:26:08 <SpamapS> jamespage: he's in India

 16:26:36 <SpamapS> jamespage: but I think he can work on this stuff only after working hours, which should fall into your TZ

 16:26:42 <jamespage> great

 16:26:59 <jamespage> I thought you mean't roaksoax for a minute then

 16:27:15 <jamespage> I guess bug 898840 won't make alpha-2

 16:27:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 898840 in cobbler (Ubuntu) "'default' preseed should be enlister" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/898840

 16:27:28 <jamespage> I believe bug 904681 is now fixed

 16:27:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 904681 in Ubuntu "precise amd64 minimal-virtual install is oversized" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/904681

 16:28:04 <jamespage> test when green today in jenkins

 16:28:14 <jamespage> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20ISO%20Testing%20Dashboard/view/Daily/job/precise-server-amd64_minimal-virtual/79/

 16:28:17 <hallyn> that'd be grrreat

 16:28:31 <jamespage> wonders what we actually did to fix it....

 16:29:28 <jamespage> bug 906654 is not currently milestone targetted

 16:29:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 906654 in nova (Ubuntu) "nova should depend on openstackx and load appropriate osapi_extensions by default" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/906654

 16:29:56 <adam_g> jamespage: i think that will eventually be marked invalid, the openstackx library is to be deprecated and removed from openstack entirely this cycle

 16:29:57 <jamespage> adam_g, zul - any thoughts on this and when/if it might happen

 16:30:13 <jamespage> adam_g: good

 16:30:21 <jamespage> pls can you comment to that effect.

 16:30:24 <zul> jamespage: i think openstackx i sbeing dropped so i need to doubleechk

 16:30:24 <adam_g> jamespage: happening soon if not already

 16:30:57 <jamespage> adam_g, zul: same with bug 907197

 16:30:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 907197 in nova (Ubuntu) "ip address can't be injected into the instance when using lxc " [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/907197

 16:31:16 <zul> jamespage: still havent reproduced it

 16:31:29 <jamespage> zul: ack

 16:31:54 <jamespage> rbasak, around? care to update on bug 879666

 16:31:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 879666 in nova (Ubuntu Precise) "chown error for console.fifo when launching vm" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/879666

 16:32:16 <rbasak> I will update the patch for oneiric-updates

 16:32:23 <rbasak> but the patch isn't present in precise atm

 16:32:29 <rbasak> so can't complete the SRU justification

 16:32:43 <rbasak> Was speaking to Daviey about this earlier

 16:32:49 <rbasak> I think he wants the patch taken into precise too

 16:32:56 <jamespage> OK

 16:33:13 <Daviey> zul: Please re-introduce that patch to precise.

 16:33:23 <zul> ack

 16:33:35 <jamespage> lynxman was working on bug 916489

 16:33:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 916489 in ipxe (Ubuntu) "grub-ipxe says "B: command not found"" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/916489

 16:33:47 <jamespage> which needs a new upstream release of ipxe

 16:33:57 <jamespage> but I know he's short on time for this now

 16:34:18 <lynxman> jamespage: unfortunately my management requires my attention elsewhere, new release is almost ready

 16:34:25 <jamespage> Daviey: still key that makes alpha-2?

 16:34:28 <lynxman> jamespage: I reckon tops weekend will be here

 16:35:23 <Daviey> jamespage: no, it can wait

 16:35:44 <Daviey> I thought we were just waiting on the version string resolution?

 16:36:00 <jamespage> bug 833499

 16:36:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 833499 in OpenStack Compute (nova) "virt/disk.py unconditionally inserts public_keys into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/833499

 16:36:15 <jamespage> looks like we have a workaround for the moment

 16:37:19 <jamespage> zul, smoser: is that getting any upstream focus in esses?

 16:37:34 <smoser> probably not.

 16:37:40 <zul> still on my neverending todo list

 16:38:36 <jamespage> zul: is bug 901881 there as well?

 16:38:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova should depend on python-keystone" [Low,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:39:09 <zul> jamespage: keystone is in transition right now so that is in limbo kind of

 16:39:21 <jamespage> right - I understand

 16:39:29 <jamespage> so not in the short term then

 16:39:35 <zul> no...

 16:39:46 <jamespage> rbasak, hows OpenMPI looking (bug 889644)

 16:39:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 889644 in openmpi (Ubuntu) "Please update OpenMPI to the 1.5 upstream version" [Wishlist,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/889644

 16:39:59 <rbasak> it's built in a ppa now

 16:40:22 <rbasak> next step is to try building its dependencies against it

 16:40:35 <rbasak> debian armel ftbfs, but ubuntu is ok

 16:40:39 <Daviey> neat

 16:40:55 <jamespage> rbasak, likely to land for beta-1?

 16:41:38 <Daviey> rbasak: Depends on the testing of rdepends, rebuild right?

 16:41:50 <rbasak> yep

 16:42:08 <rbasak> if it works then we can get it in the archive straight away

 16:42:19 <rbasak> Holdups will depend on any bugs

 16:42:29 <jamespage> OK bug 907206

 16:42:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 907206 in keystone (Ubuntu) "SPACES missed in /usr/share/man/man8/keystone.8.gz" [Wishlist,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/907206
