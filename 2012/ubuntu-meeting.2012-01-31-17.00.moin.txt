 17:00:51 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] ARM Status (ppisati)

 17:00:53 <ppisati> P/omap4: a new kernel version (1405.7) was released, with improved PM support and fixes for the usb subsystem (CMA revert).

 17:00:56 <ppisati> P/master: problems with mmc were due to twl4030's GPIO lines being inactive at boot time since support was factored out in a kernel module; recompiling it in the main kernel made omap3 boards boot off the mmc again (12.20).

 17:01:00 <ppisati> SRU: new kernels were released for every supported arch/release.

 17:01:03 <ppisati> ..

 17:01:20 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Release Metrics and Incoming Bugs (jsalisbury)

 17:01:32 <jsalisbury> Release metrics and incoming bug data can be reviewed at the following link:

 17:01:49 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Milestone Targeted Work Items (ogasawara)

 17:02:03 <ogasawara> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/canonical-kernel-distro-team-precise-alpha-2.html

 17:02:04 <ogasawara> I've pushed out any open work items from Alpha-2 to Beta-1.

 17:02:13 <ogasawara> Additionally, some work items have come to my attention but I'm unaware

 17:02:14 <ogasawara> of anyone from our team actually working on them:

 17:02:22 <ogasawara> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-ceph

 17:02:23 <ogasawara> [canonical-kernel-team] investigate large xattr support patch from Ted T'so in ext4: TODO

 17:02:23 <ogasawara> [canonical-kernel-team] potentially help push large xattr support to ext4: TODO

 17:02:27 <ogasawara> Did anyone attend that session at UDS and commit us to those work items?

 17:02:28 <ogasawara> I suspect these may just get postponed.

 17:02:52 <apw> those were for the cluster filesystem thing

 17:03:06 <apw> for use in openstack iirc

 17:03:07 <apw> ..

 17:03:35 <ogasawara> k, i'll follow up and see if I can find out more.

 17:03:48 <ogasawara> Also, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-arm-p-optional-initrd

 17:03:51 <ogasawara> [canonical-kernel-team] provide a kernel with uuid support in the internal initrd for measuring

 17:03:54 <ogasawara> I vaguely recall there were discussions regarding this work item at the

 17:03:55 <ogasawara> rally, but I'm unaware of what the outcome was?

 17:05:23 <tgardner> oagdunno where that one is. I think ogra was gonna do some testing

 17:05:32 <tgardner> ogasawara, ^

 17:05:41 <ogasawara> ack

 17:05:48 <ogasawara> ..

 17:05:56 <tgardner> punted...

 17:05:57 <ogra_> tgardner, well, the foundations WIs were all postponed/blocked yesterday

 17:06:21 <ogasawara> ogra_: blocked on the above work item?

 17:06:32 <ogra_> i can indeed do a test of with/without initrd, but that wont tell anything about with/with minimal initrd in kernel

 17:06:49 <ogra_> ogasawara, yes

 17:06:56 <ogra_> but i cant speak for slangasek :)

 17:06:59 <tgardner> ogra_, but don't we have an option to generate a minimal initrd now ?

 17:07:03 <ogra_> he set his items to blocked

 17:07:24 <ogra_> wrt my item i can easily provide you with data tomorrow if that helps anyone

 17:07:55 <tgardner> ogra_, I think those would be interesting numbers.

 17:08:04 <ogra_> tgardner, i dont think so ... when i said minimal i meant the in-kernel initrd just containing teh blkid command as we had discussed

 17:08:34 <ogra_> though i think slangasek would even like to see that done in-kernel with a patch (which i think you already said is to intrusive)

 17:09:10 <apw> ogra_, probabally we should discuss a plan for this feature offline, we are clearly confused on who is doing what when in which order

 17:09:26 <ogra_> apw, k

 17:09:27 <slangasek> tgardner: FSVO "minimal" that always includes udev and sundry other utilities

 17:09:56 <ogra_> slangasek, not necessarily, thats why we have devtmpfs, no ?

 17:09:57 <tgardner> slangasek, I guess I was referring to the "tailored" initrd so taht we could see if there was _any_ time differences

 17:10:12 <slangasek> there is no support for generating any genuinely minimal initramfs out of initramfs-tools

 17:10:43 <ogra_> right, it will always be bloated and at least contain both libc's

 17:12:10 <tgardner> ..

 17:12:19 <apw> we'll discuss it offline ..

 17:12:22 <jsalisbury> Everyone OK with moving on?

 17:12:30 <ogra_> ..

 17:12:33 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Blueprint: hardware-p-kernel-power-management (cking)

 17:12:36 <cking> nothing to report this week

 17:12:36 <cking> ..

 17:12:47 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Precise Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:12:50 <ogasawara> Last week we rebased to v3.2.2 and uploaded.  There is a potential

 17:12:51 <ogasawara> regression in v3.2.2 that I'm concerned about, bug 923512.  jsalisbury

 17:12:51 <ogasawara> is working with the bug reporters and has a test kernel with the

 17:12:51 <ogasawara> offending patch reverted.  If anyone else has hw which uses the ath9k

 17:12:51 <ogasawara> driver, it would be nice if you could test.  I'd consider this would

 17:12:51 <ogasawara> warrent an upload to fix before the milestone which is in 2 days, Thurs

 17:12:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 923512 in linux (Ubuntu) "ath9k wireless stopped working after kernel upgrade to 3.2.0-12" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/923512

 17:12:53 <ogasawara> Feb 2.  This means we'd likely have to upload by end of day today.

 17:12:55 <ogasawara> ..

 17:13:22 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: CVE's (apw)

 17:14:34 <apw> Note that the table has a new column this week, the "Defd" column

 17:14:35 <apw> represents the number of CVEs which have been referred back to security for

 17:14:36 <apw> resoution, either for lack of a fix or if the fix is not clearly complete.

 17:14:37 <apw> 

 17:14:38 <apw> Nine new CVEs were added this week, of which about 6 have been resolved.

 17:14:39 <apw> We have also finally dropped lucid/mvl-dove from the table above.
