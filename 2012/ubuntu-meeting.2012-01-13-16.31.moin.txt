 16:45:15 <pitti> (hopefully) fixed libo is building now, with some extra care to hit the fastest buildds we have

 16:45:27 <pitti> and unity-2d is now building, too

 16:45:39 <pitti> once these two are done, precise should be much happier again

 16:49:38 <shadeslayer> Riddell: Quintasan: anything we need to add there?

 16:49:49 <shadeslayer> ...

 16:49:53 <Quintasan> We might be also looking into kde-telepathy 0.3 release

 16:49:59 <Quintasan> That's all I think

 16:50:09 <skaet> Thanks shadeslayer, Quintasan, Riddell  :)

 16:50:43 * skaet not seeing questions, and appreciates the burndown workitems scrubbing that went on last week.  :)

 16:51:13 <skaet> [TOPIC] Edubuntu Team Q&A - stgraber or highvoltage

 16:51:17 <highvoltage> bonjour!

 16:51:20 <stgraber> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000694.html

 16:51:31 <stgraber> I think that's about it unless highvoltage has something else

 16:51:33 <stgraber> .. for me

 16:51:45 <highvoltage> well if anyone wants any further bedtime reading...

 16:51:52 <highvoltage> here's the notes to last nights edubuntu meeting:

 16:51:53 <highvoltage> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/edubuntu-devel/2012-January/003789.html

 16:51:57 <highvoltage> ..

 16:52:00 <skaet> Thanks stgraber, highvoltage  :)

 16:52:21 <highvoltage> :)

 16:52:23 <skaet> [TOPIC] Xubuntu Team Q&A - madnick or charlie-tca

 16:52:28 <charlie-tca> Well

 16:52:49 <charlie-tca> I am not really in the loop right now. I do apologize for not having the information available

 16:53:13 <charlie-tca> I can try to get things together for next week, though.

 16:53:15 <charlie-tca> ..

 16:53:46 <skaet> thanks charlie-tca,  email summary is there,  but a bit worried about Xubuntu not building.

 16:53:53 <cjwatson> hmm?

 16:54:01 <pitti> libo?

 16:54:07 <charlie-tca> Neither ubuntu nor xubuntu destkop images are there today

 16:54:23 <cjwatson> the xubuntu failure is unity 5.0 fallout

 16:54:27 <cjwatson> it should be sorted out rsn

 16:54:28 <charlie-tca> usb-creator-gtk is giving a problem

 16:54:38 <charlie-tca> Thank you, cjwatson

 16:54:43 <cjwatson> I'll double-check but I suspect it's transient

 16:54:52 <charlie-tca> We did have images working yesterday

 16:54:59 <cjwatson> I ignored most of today's build failures because libo was in chaos

 16:55:19 <skaet> Thanks.   ok,  I'll remove it from my worry list.  :)

 16:55:22 <charlie-tca> The Maybe-ubiquity change caused a couple of days of issues, but it is working now

 16:55:36 <skaet> coolio.

 16:55:45 <cjwatson> usb-creator-gtk isn't on precise_probs so I think it's sorted

 16:55:46 <stgraber> usb-creator-gtk should be fine, we're just waiting for unity-2d to be puslished for it to be installable

 16:55:49 <stgraber> ..

 16:55:54 <cjwatson> charlie-tca: actually it didn't, you were bitten by another coincident bugs

 16:55:57 <cjwatson> *bug

 16:56:05 <charlie-tca> Oh

 16:56:14 <charlie-tca> Well, thanks for getting us fixed.

 16:56:15 <cjwatson> that was the fix in livecd-rootfs 2.48

 16:56:43 * skaet notes she accidently skipped foundations,  going back to that now.

 16:56:44 <charlie-tca> stgraber: why should Xubuntu fail because of unity-2d?

 16:57:05 <stgraber> charlie-tca: usb-creator-gtk depends on gir1.2-unity-4.0,

 16:57:11 <stgraber> ..

 16:57:14 <charlie-tca> ..

 16:57:16 <skaet> [TOPIC] Foundations team Q&A - cjwatson

 16:57:26 <cjwatson> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000693.html

 16:57:29 <cjwatson> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/canonical-foundations.html

 16:57:32 <cjwatson> Happy with progress here (I needed subsections in my mail!), and we split down a couple of very big work items into a slew of smaller ones on which we're making progress; I've postponed a few more just now; but obviously more to do ...

 16:57:36 <cjwatson> Image builds are a bit of a mess right now, but that's mostly due to libreoffice and should settle again once that's fixed.

 16:57:42 <cjwatson> And sorry I had to miss the rally this time round!

 16:57:42 <cjwatson> ..

 16:58:09 <skaet> Thanks cjwatson!   :)   we missed seeing you.

 16:59:01 * skaet will expect to see some postponed,  but yes nice progress this week.  :)

 16:59:05 <skaet> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Studio Team Q&A - scott-work

 16:59:18 <scott-work> hello all...

 16:59:19 <scott-work> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000708.html

 16:59:28 <skaet> hiya :)

 16:59:42 <scott-work> progress basically died during december due to me traveling for holidays and some illness

 17:00:10 <scott-work> but progress is getting back in stride and i expect to be getting many things done during the remainder of january and into february

 17:00:11 <scott-work> ..

 17:00:20 <cjwatson> o/

 17:00:25 <skaet> go cjwatson

 17:00:34 <skaet> (and thanks scott-work )

 17:00:40 <cjwatson> noting your Issues section so not saying it's your fault, but do you know if the ubuntustudio side of your live dvd work items (seeds and the like) are going to be sorted out soon, or if they need help from e.g. me?  just an advance warning that I likely drop off the map for a couple of weeks in February.

 17:01:21 <scott-work> cjwatson: that you for the update about you not being available...

 17:01:34 <scott-work> i would like to have the seeds/live dvd issues resolved before end of january actually

 17:01:51 <scott-work> alessio bogani packaging the lowlatency kernel was a big help to unload off of my plate

 17:02:11 <scott-work> hopefully i get teh website completed this weekend and then the next large focus is going to be the seeds/livedvd

 17:02:12 <scott-work> ..

 17:02:22 <scott-work> (although there is probably something i forget :P )

 17:02:31 <skaet> Thanks for those details though.  :)

 17:02:42 <cjwatson> ok.  give me a shout when you're ready and we can work on it together; it should amount to a day of concentrated work to get everything converted, I think

 17:02:56 <skaet> [TOPIC] Lubuntu Team Q&A - gilir

 17:03:05 <gilir> hi :)

 17:03:10 <gilir> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-January/000697.html

 17:03:20 <gilir> nothing to add

 17:03:21 <gilir> ..

 17:03:28 <skaet> Thanks gilir.  :)

 17:03:39 <skaet> [TOPIC] MOTU Team Q&A - tumbleweed or Laney

 17:03:52 <tumbleweed> hi, as usual, nothing of interest :)

 17:03:53 <tumbleweed> ..

 17:04:33 <skaet> Thanks tumbleweed.  I'm not seeing anyone raise hands, so moving on.

 17:04:34 <cjwatson> hey, we got the new sync process advertised this week!

 17:04:45 <tumbleweed> indeed :)
