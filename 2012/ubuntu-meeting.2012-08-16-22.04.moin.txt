 22:04:39 <IdleOne> #topic Ubuntu Membership Board 2200 UTC

 22:04:44 <Phantomas> Hello everyone!

 22:04:44 <IdleOne> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for August 16, 2012 Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:05:04 <IdleOne> my copy paste is failing me

 22:05:06 <IdleOne> :)

 22:05:14 <IdleOne> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:05:14 <IdleOne> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:05:23 <IdleOne> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:05:23 <IdleOne> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:05:32 <IdleOne> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:05:32 <IdleOne> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:05:45 <IdleOne> Phantomas: please introduce yourself

 22:06:26 <Phantomas> Hello, I am Fotis Tsamis, an IT student living in Greece! I am an Ubuntu user since 2008 and a contributor since 2009

 22:06:35 <Phantomas> My page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FotisTsamis

 22:06:58 <Phantomas> I enjoy programming in Python and GUI designing in GTK+ :)

 22:08:23 <stgraber> oh, didn't know Phantomas was applying for membership, he's one of the great upstreams of epoptes, the new classroom management tool we started using for a couple of release in Edubuntu.

 22:08:45 <cyphermox> stgraber: that's what I thought; great :)

 22:08:51 <Phantomas> Hi stgraber! Thank you :)

 22:09:03 <IdleOne> Phantomas: I see you don't have any testimonials on your wiki page, did you ask for any?

 22:09:35 <IdleOne> well, you just got one from stgraber :)

 22:09:36 <Phantomas> IdleOne: No, actually... I wanted to become a member from my work, and not from my contacts!

 22:09:51 <cyphermox> Phantomas: it would be cool if you had friends from the Greek LoCo to acknowledge your work and cheer for you :)

 22:09:52 <Phantomas> for*

 22:09:52 <xnox> Phantomas: we have an excellent design doc for a Python GTK+ application which is incomplete. Would you be interested in joining upstream work on.... ubiquity installer? =)

 22:10:25 <Phantomas> xnox: Sure!! :D

 22:10:32 <PabloRubianes> Phantomas: are you active in you LoCo?

 22:11:10 <Phantomas> PabloRubianes: I am as much as I can... since I am working hard with sch-scripts and epoptes though, not much time remains for helping etc

 22:11:21 <Phantomas> I help on IRC mostly

 22:11:28 <Phantomas> (#ubuntu-gr)

 22:12:50 <Phantomas> xnox: Really, that would be great... I am super interested!

 22:12:51 <PabloRubianes> yes having more free time is something we all want

 22:13:13 <Phantomas> PabloRubianes: I have much free time, I spent it on programming though :)
