 10:02:42 <amithkk> Its open like before right?

 10:02:52 <head_victim> I can't see bonepyaesone, chrisgagnon, oscalation or bodman456 though so I guess we should start with jokerdino

 10:03:24 <head_victim> #topic jokerdino's membership application

 10:03:35 <head_victim> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/jokerdino

 10:03:42 <head_victim> jokerdino: please introduce yourself to the baord

 10:03:52 <jokerdino> Hi, I am Barneedhar. I am a 18 years old junior college student currently studying in Singapore.

 10:04:04 <jokerdino> I am widely known as jokerdino across the Internet. This is my wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/jokerdino.

 10:04:21 <jokerdino> Most of my contributions have been in the Ask Ubuntu, where I mostly do the janitorial work like tidying up the current answers and answering some of the questions myself.

 10:04:34 <jokerdino> When I do get bored of Ask Ubuntu, I make use of bilingual skills and translate Ubuntu into Tamil.

 10:04:52 * jokerdino got excited and prepped up the whole thing beforehand.

 10:05:09 <head_victim> jokerdino: good to see,

 10:05:27 <czajkowski> jokerdino: nice wiki page :)

 10:07:40 <oscalation> head_victim, Destine thanks

 10:07:47 <czajkowski> jokerdino: ok, but just keep in mind things can be done over irc to help teams.

 10:09:28 <popey> I'd like to give a cheer for jokerdino, very friendly and helpful person both on AU and outside

 10:09:39 <czajkowski> popey: thanks

 10:09:48 <head_victim> As someone not overly familiar with AU, is the 4600 a high score?

 10:14:57 <jokerdino> hah, nice to know :D

 10:15:34 <head_victim> oscalation: you have recently applied and asked to come back, to make things easier what has changed since your last application

 10:16:32 <oscalation> hey head_victim and others. Im Oscalation. Ive been using ubuntu for many years. My launchpad profile can be found here https://launchpad.net/~nathan1465-5 and Wiki page here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/oscalation. I have a few testimonials. I have been active in Ubuntu Answers and Ubuntu Documentation.  I do some small Beta testing, been testing 12.04 for a while now. I enjoy using Ubuntu and helping other users online. Im slowly moving my

 10:16:32 <oscalation> launchpad karma points closer to my 10k goal. In the near future I hope to meet 10k karma and increase my involvement with documentation. Major changes was that I obtained a few testimonials and did a little work on my wiki page.

 10:18:31 <head_victim> oscalation: bear with us, just reading over the documentation

 10:18:37 <elky> oscalation, did you see head_victim's question?

 10:19:47 <oscalation> no problem. take your time. Yes. Changes since last meeting was that I have corrected my wiki page, increased my activitys in Ubuntu answers, obtain some testimonials to account for my involvement's.

 10:20:08 <elky> but you're still not using askubuntu?

 10:20:30 <oscalation> No. I do not use AskUbuntu.

 10:20:35 <elky> why not?

 10:20:51 <head_victim> oscalation: is there any involvement in teams outside of Answers?

 10:21:54 <oscalation> No. Other than updating Documentation here and there.

 10:21:57 <jokerdino> oscalation: we are a bunch of nice guys in ask ubuntu. :)

 10:22:15 <oscalation> i havent made the switch. isnt ask ubuntu = stack exchange?

 10:22:17 <amithkk> oscalation: You bet on that

 10:22:18 <jokerdino> we will be happy to have you

 10:22:28 <amithkk> We will love you there

 10:22:42 <Destine> oscalation, i see you participate in #ubuntu-devel, bugs and testing, do you have any involvement with these teams' activities?

 10:22:48 <head_victim> Not to say that Answers isn't a worthy project, I'm just trying to see if there's any involvement eslewhere.

 10:22:54 <benonsoftware> oscalation: Its like a big family on Stack Exchange :P

 10:23:24 <elky> oscalation, yes, it's stack exchange. it's the prefered place because it's more interactive and lets good answers essentially be showcased and easier to find for the next person with the problem

 10:23:44 <oscalation> no problem. my involvement with bugs and testing is nothing official, more so ive helped and talked on the mailing list before.

 10:23:55 <oscalation> elky, doe ask ubuntu work with ubuntu ssi

 10:23:56 <Destine> oscalation, i see.

 10:24:19 <jokerdino> oscalation: we are currently working on Ubuntu SSO, but launchpad SSO is already working.

 10:24:33 <oscalation> good enough for me

 10:24:41 <Destine> jokerdino, advertising huh.

 10:24:43 <elky> oscalation, openid with launchpad. it has it's own karma system though

 10:24:50 <oscalation> ah dang

 10:24:59 <head_victim> Ready to vote?

 10:25:01 <elky> karma on launchpad is a huge red herring really

 10:25:02 <jokerdino> Destine: No, lol. Just clearing up the doubts :D

 10:25:19 <oscalation> i file some bug reports on launchpad but not enough to hit my 10k mark by the end of the year

 10:26:10 <czajkowski> head_victim: yes

 10:29:02 <meetingology> Deadlock, casting vote may be used

 10:29:54 <head_victim> oscalation: I'm happy to work with you on this but I really would like to see some more involvement in more than just one team. If you're only involved in one team I'd expect to see an extreme involvement backed up by a bunch of signed testimonials from the team members.

 10:30:52 <oscalation> This is getting to be a little bit much. I am involved, with ubuntu answers, it seems this doenst count even though the application process  claims to be impartial of what form or channel users contribute from.

 10:31:21 <Destine> AlanBell, glad to see you here.

 10:31:31 <Destine> AlanBell, that deadlock appears again.

 10:31:33 <AlanBell> hi, how can I help?

 10:31:41 <elky> oscalation, you were asked last time to broaden your horizons.

 10:32:11 <Destine> oscalation, and to improve your testimonials.

 10:32:19 <oscalation> what your indirectly stating is that My involvement in Ubuntu Answers is hard to measure therefor not accepted. Which should be discussed and added to the application process.

 10:32:23 <sagaci> > #votesrequired 1

 10:32:54 <Destine> AlanBell, when we gave 4 +0, it's deadlock...

 10:33:01 <head_victim> I've got to be honest, I don't know who Olivier is and only have a passing reference of who Andy is. If I had signed testimonials I could look up who they are.

 10:33:11 <head_victim> sagaci: yeah I should have made it +4 before :/

 10:33:25 <AlanBell> sagaci is right :)

 10:33:27 <sagaci> head_victim: shouldn't it be +1

 10:33:47 <sagaci> you don't need everyone to be on the crazytrain :)

 10:33:49 <Destine> sagaci, +1 is right.

 10:33:55 <oscalation> I added a testimonial from ActionParsnip as requested before, and I got more votes then i believe.

 10:34:22 <oscalation> ive improved the requested improvements from the last meeting and obtained less votes

 10:34:29 <sagaci> oscalation: all involvement in ubuntu is hard to measure

 10:34:29 <head_victim> sagaci: trying to suss that out, possible needs all 4 +1s as we only have bare minimum quorum

 10:34:37 <oscalation> Is there a board to dispute this vote with? Im not interested in applying again.

 10:36:09 <benonsoftware> oscalation: The Community Council, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil ?

 10:36:21 <head_victim> oscalation: if you're unhappy with the result please contact the community council as benonsoftware has just linked

 10:36:32 <head_victim> They are the body who oversees the board.

 10:36:32 <Destine> oscalation, or Local Council? head_victim

 10:36:41 <elky> I'm not at all impressed that membership is being treated as some kind of right.

 10:36:44 <oscalation> Thanks. I'll shoo them a message. I'll save the discussion and post it on my wiki for other team involvements. Thanks alot.

 10:36:44 <czajkowski> Destine: no not the LC!!

 10:37:05 <Destine> czajkowski, thank you for the correction. I am not sure about that.

 10:37:21 <czajkowski> Destine: the CC is over all governance boards

 10:37:26 <czajkowski> Destine: the LC is over locoteams :)

 10:37:27 * benonsoftware thinks is czajkowski on the CC?

 10:37:32 <czajkowski> benonsoftware: I am

 10:38:28 * jokerdino forgot to thank czajkowski for helping out with my wiki page.

 10:38:42 <jokerdino> eh, a bit too late?

 10:38:54 <czajkowski> jokerdino: thats ok any time

 10:38:55 <Destine> jokerdino, no.

 10:39:02 <head_victim> #endvote

 10:39:02 <meetingology> No vote in progress

 10:39:21 <head_victim> Ok so no other applicants are around we'll end the meeting

 10:39:39 <sagaci> well done jokerdino

 10:39:47 <Destine> jokerdino, congrats.
