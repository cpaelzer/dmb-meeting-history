 18:03:16 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 18:03:29 <jdstrand> Thanks to bdrung for his help on security updates for the community supported vlc last week. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 18:03:38 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Review of any previous action items

 18:03:54 <jdstrand> actually, don't have any of those

 18:03:59 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:04:02 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:04:11 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 18:04:20 <jdstrand> I've got to finish up community work from last week

 18:04:34 <jdstrand> I've also been working almost exclusively on MIR audits

 18:05:14 <jdstrand> I have a couple/few left, but it is slow going cause I need a functional openstack and that has proved elusive on quantal

 18:05:45 <jdstrand> I should also get started on the hiring process for our open generalist position

 18:06:25 <jdstrand> once my audits are done, I hope to dig into my webkit maintenance investigation

 18:06:41 <jdstrand> and get back to my pending updates

 18:06:47 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're next

 18:09:57 <mdeslaur> whoops, sorry

 18:10:02 <mdeslaur> I'm working on nss updates

 18:10:11 <mdeslaur> and will pick something else from the list

 18:10:17 <mdeslaur> I'm also on triage this week

 18:10:30 <mdeslaur> that,s about it. sbeattie, you're up

 18:10:39 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week.

 18:10:52 <sbeattie> I've got two embargoed issues on my plate

 18:11:20 <sbeattie> I've also got a openstack issue that I need to test.

 18:11:40 <sbeattie> Once I've cleared those, I'm planning to get back to the apparmor dbus stuff.

 18:11:53 <sbeattie> I may also pick up another one from the list.

 18:12:00 <sbeattie> That's it from me.

 18:12:04 <sbeattie> micahg: you're up

 18:13:05 <micahg> still working on webkit, will be taking back Mozilla pretesting from tyhicks, precise should be promoted to -updates/-security this week barring any issues (I haven't heard anyone scream yet)

 18:13:47 <micahg> I guess that's it for me

 18:13:59 <tyhicks> I'm handling community this week

 18:14:27 <tyhicks> I'm currently working on some upstream auditd patches to disable network listening support. They should go out to the list today.

 18:14:44 <jdstrand> micahg: what about the other releases? istr you saying those were going to hit this week

 18:15:23 <micahg> jdstrand: yeah, hoping to drop oneiric and natty into proposed this week, going a little slower than I'd hoped

 18:15:47 <jdstrand> micahg: but you've got a handle on it?

 18:15:53 <micahg> jdstrand: yeah

 18:15:57 <jdstrand> ok cool

 18:16:10 <jdstrand> tyhicks: did you manage to talk to upstream auditd about the network stuff?

 18:16:43 <tyhicks> jdstrand: No, but it is straight forward so I'd like to start the conversation with the patch set

 18:16:49 <jdstrand> I see

 18:16:51 <jdstrand> thanks

 18:16:56 <jdstrand> sorry for the interruption

 18:17:15 <tyhicks> jdstrand: There are a few existing examples of other features (such as GSSAPI) that get flicked on and off at build time. I followed them.

 18:17:44 <tyhicks> I have an eCryptfs pull request that I need to prepare and send to Linus. Shouldn't take long, just need to get to it.

 18:17:52 <tyhicks> Then my focus will be on updates

 18:17:58 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 18:18:22 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 18:18:28 <jjohansen> well I have some dbus patch fixes to finish up so sbeattie can finish getting a ppa together.

 18:19:07 <jjohansen> Hopefully I'll get some patch review feedback this week that I can roll in to the current patchset, and I have the locking update to finish off

 18:20:23 <jjohansen> oh and I suppose it will be back to the stacking work after that

 18:20:31 <jjohansen> jdstrand: back to you

 18:21:00 <sbeattie> jjohansen: yeah, sorry, I'm trying to get to reviewing those patches as well.

 18:21:17 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 18:21:23 <jjohansen> sbeattie: heh I know :)
