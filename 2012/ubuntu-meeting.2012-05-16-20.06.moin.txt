 20:06:56 <StephenSmally> ok

 20:07:41 <jmarsden|work> OK, so we need to figure out some sort of future direction, and we need a new wiki champion, as I understand it.

 20:07:52 <jmarsden|work> #topic wiki champion

 20:08:06 <jmarsden|work> Anyone know of any volunteers for that role so far?

 20:09:02 <jmarsden|work> OK.  So all we can do for now is make the need known.

 20:09:19 <bodhi_zazen> amjjawad might be a great person to do this , he is not available until after at least June 1st

 20:09:31 <jmarsden|work> #action jmarsden|work to email the list asking for volunteer wiki champions

 20:09:31 * meetingology jmarsden|work to email the list asking for volunteer wiki champions

 20:09:40 <StephenSmally> Well, i think we should have at leats three teams: Wiki team, Devel team and Art team

 20:09:45 <StephenSmally> *least

 20:10:10 <StephenSmally> Each team should have a "center" person

 20:10:10 <Unit193> amjjawad has said that he doesn't like wikis, and doesn't understand them though.

 20:10:36 <will_> Wiki, or "Docs"?

 20:10:36 <bodhi_zazen> Yea, but, I have spoken with him more recently, and there are ways to support him

 20:10:40 <nothingspecial> There are forum staff waiting to help with moving any documentation currently on the forums to the wiki http://bodhizazen.net/tweaks/ubforums2ubwiki.sh.txt

 20:10:46 <bodhi_zazen> http://bodhizazen.net/tweaks/ubforums2ubwiki.sh.txt

 20:10:56 <bodhi_zazen> script to convert forums posts -> wiki syntax

 20:11:05 <bodhi_zazen> script works well, has been tested

 20:12:19 <jmarsden|work> Sounds like we can let the wiki champion opening go until at least June 1st so amjjawad can provide his input on the subject.

 20:12:30 <jmarsden|work> Moving on to the more general issue...

 20:12:36 <jmarsden|work> #topic future direction

 20:12:51 <StephenSmally> Guys, i know everyone wants to do something for lubuntu, but IMHO the organization is not clear

 20:13:07 <StephenSmally> Is not clear who and how much are the developers

 20:13:23 <StephenSmally> The art team seems is made by rafael only

 20:13:50 <bodhi_zazen> o/

 20:13:59 <StephenSmally> yes?

 20:14:29 <bodhi_zazen> I suggest you encourage community members to be more actively involved

 20:14:34 <wxl> someone correct me if i'm wrong but isn't julien still developing? just not going to be relaly involved in any sort of communications?

 20:14:47 <bodhi_zazen> julien is developing

 20:14:58 <bodhi_zazen> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/lubuntu-users/2012-May/001516.html

 20:15:46 <StephenSmally> Ok, but Julien is not the only developer...

 20:15:48 <jmarsden|work> Correct.  And I'm here too, not that I have done a lot of development/packaging recently, but I have not gone away :)

 20:16:02 <jmarsden|work> Officially the lubuntu-dev membership can be seen at https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-dev/+members#active

 20:16:37 <bodhi_zazen> 3 developers , or am I reading that wrong ?

 20:16:46 <jmarsden|work> Right.

 20:16:59 <StephenSmally> yes, plus the Lsc team

 20:17:03 <wxl> considering so much is upstream i don't see that as disporportionate

 20:17:24 <StephenSmally> which counts 5 member

 20:17:53 <StephenSmally> IMO is disproporzionate

 20:18:20 <StephenSmally> the problem is that each developer cares about his code

 20:18:43 <StephenSmally> for example pcman fix pcmanfm bugs (which is good, don't misunderstand me)

 20:19:05 <StephenSmally> but we don't have a real team behavior

 20:19:14 <nothingspecial> so we come back to encouraging the community to be more actively involved

 20:19:25 <nothingspecial> ?

 20:19:25 <bodhi_zazen> +1 nothingspecial

 20:19:35 <wxl> encouraging them to be devs will require training

 20:19:54 <wxl> i'd even like to contribute as a dev but don't feel that i have a good background to do so

 20:20:06 <bodhi_zazen> training or reading

 20:20:16 <nothingspecial> or mentoring?

 20:20:28 <wxl> any and all but should be clear how to do it

 20:20:32 <jmarsden|work> Learning, not necessarily training... self-study works too.  How you get the skills is less important than having them.

 20:20:40 <bodhi_zazen> mentoring with expected reading ;p

 20:20:41 <StephenSmally> I think that if we organize the teams better, we would be able to get more volunteers

 20:21:25 <StephenSmally> I mean, if a volunteer don't know who talk to to  know how to fix a bug, he won't fix it

 20:21:34 <StephenSmally> (poor example, i admit)

 20:21:45 <bodhi_zazen> communication helps

 20:22:12 <nothingspecial> across the community

 20:22:18 <wxl> +1 StephenSmally

 20:22:27 <bodhi_zazen> rewarding those who contribute, with training / education helps

 20:23:01 <jmarsden|work> StephenSmally: Do you have specific suggestions for how to "organize the teams better"?  Either now, or can you write up your ideas and email the list, or put them on a wiki page, or whatever works to get them documented somewhere?

 20:23:30 <StephenSmally> i will write something on the mailing list

 20:23:37 <jmarsden|work> Great, thanks.

 20:23:47 <bodhi_zazen> You can not expect someone to spend 6 hours reading, and 10 hours coding, without some payoff

 20:24:02 <bodhi_zazen> developers willing to review code, mentor a little goes a long way

 20:24:03 <jmarsden|work> #action StephenSmally  to write up ideas for improved team organization and email the lubuntu-users mailing list

 20:24:03 * meetingology StephenSmally  to write up ideas for improved team organization and email the lubuntu-users mailing list

 20:24:23 <bodhi_zazen> And you can not expect community without developers talking with users

 20:24:28 <StephenSmally> bodhi_zazen, what you mean with payoff?

 20:24:44 <nothingspecial> inviting people, encouraging participation, keeping the dialogue going

 20:24:54 <bodhi_zazen> What are you going to do to motivate volunteers to donate hours of their time developing ?

 20:25:15 <StephenSmally> There are no way you can motivate somebody

 20:25:31 <StephenSmally> (IMO)

 20:25:32 <bodhi_zazen> yes and no

 20:25:36 <bodhi_zazen> you can discourage them

 20:25:46 <wxl> bodhi_zazen: i imagine that julien will still to some degree talk to users

 20:25:49 <bodhi_zazen> volunteers leave if they feel they have no voice

 20:25:51 <wxl> but will likely do it through bug reports

 20:26:02 <will_> Is there a backlog of development work?

 20:26:22 <StephenSmally> will_, not really, or i don't know it

 20:26:31 <wxl> everyone's motivated by different things

 20:26:40 <jmarsden|work> There's always bug fixes and proposed enhancements, ... to LXDE components and to pcmanfm in particular

 20:26:46 <wxl> some people are motivated by money, others egalitarianism, e.g.

 20:27:06 <will_> jmarsden|work: is that listed anywhere? Like a Bugzilla report? I think that would be helpful to list somewhere on the Dev wikipage

 20:27:24 <wxl> i suspect that there are plenty of people who would love to code but don't know where to start

 20:27:34 <nothingspecial> wxl: collaboration is the key

 20:27:48 <StephenSmally> Also, another problem for developers is that LXDE is currently hosted on git

 20:27:50 <wxl> i think if we had some sort of even informal mentoring program that would encourage a lot of people

 20:27:57 <StephenSmally> but a lot of lubuntu programs are hosted on launchpad

 20:28:08 <wxl> StephenSmally: THAT is a problem. what would it take to move it?

 20:28:55 <wxl> will_: if i remember correctly there's a todo list on the wiki, but i haven't looked in a while. that would be the logical place for it in any case. that or maybe lubuntu.

 20:29:09 <wxl> s/lubuntu/launchpad/

 20:29:18 <will_> ah ok.

 20:29:41 <StephenSmally> I think launchpad is more developer-oriented, you can have mailing lists, teams and so

 20:29:44 <jmarsden|work> StephenSmally: why is using git a problem for developers?  It works for me :)

 20:29:56 <wxl> but i think we're talking about a developer todo list, StephenSmally

 20:30:08 <StephenSmally> jmarsden|work, I mean, the incosistency between git and bazaar

 20:30:15 <bodhi_zazen> wiki.ubuntu.com for teams

 20:30:24 <Unit193> And, for example, other DE's for Ubuntu flavors aren't on LP.

 20:30:48 <jmarsden|work> StephenSmally: Just one more version control system... not a major obstacle, IMO.

 20:31:28 <wxl> one thing that seems important to deal with: i think julian was a coordinator for devs and now he's taking the role of contributor, which is fine, but who's going to take care of coordinating? who's going to take care of the dev wiki?

 20:31:43 <nothingspecial> I wonder why we are talking about development and not about the team/community, which as far as I can tell seems to be the issue

 20:32:32 <kanliot> the dev team can decide about the dev wiki

 20:32:32 <jmarsden|work> wxl: If it needs it and Julien no longer wants to do so, I can take care of the dev related wiki pages.

 20:32:38 <wxl> well i think honestly it's all very important, nothingspecial. the reason why making sure we've got the development covered is because otherwise we beocme stale and outdated.

 20:32:41 <jmarsden|work> The developmebt TODO list is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Developers/TODO

 20:33:08 <nothingspecial> thanks wxl

 20:33:23 <will_> jmarsden|work: Thanks!

 20:33:33 <wxl> i think, though, that we need a good head for wiki and-- i think-- support, too

 20:34:08 <kanliot> i'll do wiki if chris is sure hes done

 20:34:30 <jmarsden|work> wxl: Agreed in principle, but specifics on that need to wait until amjjawad has a chance to give us his input

 20:34:46 <wxl> jmarsden|work: ok :)

 20:35:40 <jmarsden|work> kanliot: OK, our first volunteer for new wiki champion... thanks for offering.  Feel fre to confirm with Chris by private email that he is "really done" if you are concerned about accidentally "stepping on his toes".

 20:35:59 <kanliot> k jmarsden|work

 20:36:12 <jmarsden|work> #topic any other business

 20:36:23 <wxl> if someone is needed for support, i'd help, too. i'm a bit tentative. life suddenly flares up and gets busy for me from time to time, but if there's no one else, i'm game.

 20:36:24 <jmarsden|work> OK, is there anything else we need to discuss today?

 20:36:27 <MrChrisDruif> I've got very small toes

 20:36:33 <nothingspecial> I am here to work with both wiki and support with the forums

 20:36:38 <kanliot> lol

 20:36:43 <nothingspecial> any team really

 20:37:24 <jmarsden|work> Ok... sounds like we are done for today.  Thanks everyone, we will meet again same time same place next week.
