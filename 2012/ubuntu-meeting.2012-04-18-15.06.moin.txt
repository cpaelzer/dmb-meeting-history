 15:07:27 <jodh> * [boot]

 15:07:28 <jodh> - plymouth: Sent a real fix for bug 553745 upstream (awaiting

 15:07:28 <jodh> feedback). Hopefully, we'll be able to close the 270 duplicate bugs

 15:07:28 <jodh> real soon now :)

 15:07:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 553745 in plymouth (Ubuntu Lucid) "plymouthd crashed with SIGSEGV in ply_event_loop_process_pending_events()" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/553745

 15:07:31 <jodh> - lightdm: Comments on bug 969489. Needs more thought.

 15:07:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 969489 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "lightdm tries (and fails) to start too early?" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/969489

 15:07:34 <jodh> * [doc]

 15:07:37 <jodh> - Cookbook updates (the cookbook now appears to have broken rst2pdf :()

 15:07:40 <jodh> * [misc]

 15:07:44 <jodh> - Updated https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/PreferredTechnologies

 15:07:47 <jodh> * [release]

 15:07:50 <jodh> - Lots of work on Upstart Release Notes

 15:07:53 <jodh> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/TechnicalOverviewUpstart

 15:07:56 <jodh> â •

 15:08:11 <ev> - Finished the apport branch that handles breaks/replaces in the retrace cache

 15:08:12 <ev> which I mentioned last week.

 15:08:13 <ev> - Continued to shop the crash database statistics website design around.

 15:08:13 <ev> Please give me your feedback as time allows.

 15:08:23 <ev> - Meeting with the good folks at Acunu on Friday to discuss their Acunu

 15:08:23 <ev> Anayltics project which we may use as the foundation of our metrics service.

 15:08:25 <ev> They're debating internally whether or not to open source it, with some

 15:08:26 <ev> people pushing hard for it to be open. Unfortunately it's a bit of a black

 15:08:28 <ev> box at the moment as the copy they're distributing is binary-only. I've put

 15:08:29 <ev> it up in the Canonicloud with a public IP and am working on instructions for

 15:08:31 <ev> those that want to test metrics collection against it.

 15:08:37 <ev> - Built a mean time between failures graph using sample data and the very cool

 15:08:38 <ev> nvd3 that itself builds on the even cooler d3.js:

 15:08:39 <ev> http://novus.github.com/nvd3/examples/cumulativeLine.html

 15:08:40 <ev> - Built out support in oops-repository for collecting mean time between

 15:08:42 <ev> failures in real time. Worked with webops to get this deployed.

 15:08:43 <ev> - Fought CSS to the death (and lost) attempting to get our most common

 15:08:45 <ev> problems table to use 100% of the available width, giving as little as it

 15:08:46 <ev> can to all the columns except for the signature one. Hacking around for now.

 15:08:48 <ev> - Dug at the whoopsie build failures on PPC and ARM. Traced the cause to a

 15:08:49 <ev> non-boolean function used as a glib callback. Fixed.

 15:08:51 <ev> - Changed our retracing code to use the new cached sandboxes and manage their

 15:08:52 <ev> creation and removal. This had a slight bug in that it was creating

 15:08:54 <ev> sandboxes for every single crash it retraced, quickly eating up the space on

 15:08:55 <ev> that production machine. I've fixed this and webops are working on deploying

 15:08:57 <ev> it.

 15:08:58 <ev> - Sat in on a FY11 presentation given by Rick.

 15:09:00 <ev> - Meeting with the design team to discuss an improved mockup and specification

 15:09:01 <ev> process.

 15:09:02 <ev> (done)

 15:11:36 <jodh> ev: np

 15:11:59 <jodh> ev: I feel that page could one day outgrow the cookbook :)

 15:12:09 <ev> I sure hope so :)

 15:12:27 <slangasek> jodh: 969489> I had talked with bryce and apw about that the other day; the real problem seems to be that the graphics-device-added event happens before the device is actually ready, for obscure kernel reasons, and we don't have a reliable event that things can wait on

 15:12:29 <ev> there's already lots of good pointers in there about things I was completely unaware of.

 15:12:39 <cjwatson> Some more installer translation merges.  Tweaked partman-auto to reduce risk.

 15:12:41 <barry> indeed

 15:12:42 <cjwatson> Add hd-media/non-pae installer build (bug 977568).

 15:12:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 977568 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "Xubuntu nightly ISOs use the non-PAE kernel, but no hd-media image is available for that" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/977568

 15:12:45 <cjwatson> Spent Thursday in London, mostly helping James track down the famous plymouth crash.

 15:12:48 <cjwatson> Fixed mountall and NTFS not being friends when pass!=0 (bug 838091).

 15:12:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 838091 in mountall (Ubuntu Oneiric) "should not try to fsck ntfs volumes on boot" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/838091

 15:12:50 <cjwatson> Fixed the last two powerpc-specific build failures in main.  Cleaned up a few other NBS and FTBFS bits and pieces.

 15:12:53 <jodh> slangasek: ugh!

 15:12:53 <cjwatson> Add manual download verification pass to ubiquity to work around apt bug 922949.

 15:12:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 922949 in apt (Ubuntu Precise) "installation process can crash due to an issue with one package when choosing "install updates" as part of the install" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/922949

 15:12:56 <cjwatson> Disable webkit cache in installer slideshow in an attempt to work around bug 979350.  That's still outstanding and tricky, though.

 15:12:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 979350 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "install with encrypted home failed near the end: OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/979350

 15:13:07 <cjwatson> Fix broken panel colour in ubiquity (bug 982883).

 15:13:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 982883 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[UIFe] Wrong color of top panel in ubiquity-dm" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/982883

 15:13:12 <cjwatson> Worked on analysing various upgrade bugs, and generally tried to clean up our rls-p-tracking list.

 15:13:15 <cjwatson> Working with dpkg upstream on bug 983187.

 15:13:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 983187 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "dpkg-divert: --add --rename --package shouldn't rename if owned by package" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/983187

 15:13:17 <cjwatson> ..

 15:13:28 <ogra_> done:

 15:13:29 <ogra_> * many many hours spent on more compiz issues (actually nearly all my week, i'm in the last stages of testing it in the images,

 15:13:29 <ogra_> seems there are still minor issues with gtk-window-decorator)

 15:13:29 <ogra_> * had long discussions with linaro about possible blueprints for arm bits (summary mail to platfound ML pending)

 15:13:29 <ogra_> * tons of user support over the weekend to nail down why suddenly initramfs doesnt find /init anymore on arm (fixed by infinity)

 15:13:32 <ogra_> * did some peer reviews

 15:13:34 <ogra_> * partman-uboot will have to be either SRU or go into 12.10 proper, compiz just stole to much of my time :(

 15:13:37 <ogra_> todo:

 15:13:39 <ogra_> * finish peer reviews

 15:13:41 <ogra_> * finish ubuntu-core wikipage rewrite

 15:13:43 <ogra_> * look into fsck slowdown (sorry steve, still didnt get to it :/ )

 15:13:45 <ogra_> UDS:

 15:13:47 <ogra_> * linaro would like to:

 15:13:51 <ogra_> a) have truely embedded image possibilities and closer integration for any embedded stuff (like dev environments

 15:13:54 <ogra_> (i.e. board specific eclipse plugins) but also the opportunity to build actual embedded images (i.e. for systems

 15:13:57 <ogra_> with only 64M ram and 128M flash space)

 15:13:59 <ogra_> b) see us integrate HW-pack usage into our build system (to drop duplication, we all seem to build the same stuff)

 15:14:02 <ogra_> both should become blueprints imho.

 15:14:04 <ogra_> ..

 15:14:56 <jodh> ogra_: what was the cause of the inaccessible /init ?

 15:15:16 <ogra_> jodh, linker path breakage in initramfs-tools and d-i

 15:15:23 <ogra_> well, fsvo breakage :)

 15:15:44 <cjwatson> aka fallout from change in progress

 15:15:47 <ogra_> right

 15:16:03 <ogra_> well, i dont think adam expected that he had to touch it

 15:16:56 <ogra_> oh

 15:16:57 <ogra_> ..

 15:20:11 <slangasek> ogra_: fsck slowdown> well if people would just be happy running metacity on arm... ;)

 15:20:20 <ogra_> haha

 15:20:25 <slangasek> ogra_: please get blueprints registered for both of those topics and targeted to the sprint

 15:20:29 <ogra_> well, its not off my TODO

 15:20:35 <ogra_> yeah, will do

 15:20:56 <slangasek> bdmurray:

 15:21:05 <ogra_> fsck can well be SRUed ... sadly partman-uboot is useless as SUR until 12.04.1

 15:21:57 <bdmurray> bug triage of update-manager and ubiquity bug reports

 15:22:12 <slangasek> well, and also useful for people building other images out of the precise archive (i.e., OEMs)... so still worth doing even if it slips

 15:22:14 <bdmurray> consolidation of duplicates of bug 984276 and bug 902603

 15:22:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 902603 in dpkg (Ubuntu Oneiric) "When installing Multi-Arch: same (meta-)package for two architectures, dpkg considers one arch as completely disappeared" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/902603

 15:25:43 <slangasek> done

 15:27:10 <slangasek> any questions anywhere?

 15:27:34 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs

 15:28:14 <bdmurray> I've tried recreating bug 978181 and bug 974402 without any luck

 15:28:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 978181 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "User home not created after install" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/978181

 15:28:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 974402 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "No user home directory created on clean install using btrfs" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/974402

 15:28:41 <bdmurray> I don't think many people choose btrfs but it is still worrisome

 15:29:27 <slangasek> encrypted home would never prevent the directory from being created, AFAIK

 15:29:44 <slangasek> though I guess ecryptfs+btrfs could be making the filesystem explode

 15:29:48 <cjwatson> this sort of thing can happen if user-setup-apply runs into an error and bails out early

 15:31:09 <cjwatson> but that's not what's happening in 978181 at least

 15:31:23 <slangasek> I have a vague memory of seeing something else on IRC about btrfs this week

 15:31:29 <cjwatson> oh eep the @home madness

 15:31:44 <slangasek> something about problems when /home is on btrfs and you're installing over an existing system?

 15:31:54 <cjwatson> it might make a difference if you're reusing an existing @home, yes

 15:33:29 <slangasek> bdmurray: is it worth testing that?

 15:34:01 <slangasek> i.e., install, then try to install again over it

 15:34:22 <bdmurray> I'll look for more duplicates but I don't think so

 15:34:54 <slangasek> you don't think it's worth testing?

 15:35:18 <bdmurray> slangasek: I don't think its worth testing before release

 15:35:26 <slangasek> ok

 15:36:08 * slangasek asks on the bug then

 15:36:12 <slangasek> moving on

 15:36:30 <bdmurray> I previously mentioned bug 984276

 15:36:31 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 984276 in casper (Ubuntu) "installing casper on a non live system causes update-initramfs to fail" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/984276

 15:37:03 <bdmurray> I was surprised by the number of people who install casper

 15:37:29 <ogra_> yeah, but there is no easy solution apart from making it uninstallable on non live fses

 15:37:47 <ogra_> i mean, if users want to shoot both their feet, who are we to stop them

 15:37:56 <slangasek> the question is why they're doing so

 15:38:02 <ogra_> indeed

 15:38:20 <slangasek> do they have a fondness for friendly ghosts, or is some web page telling them to, or...

 15:39:11 <ogra_> hmm, wasnt there another bug that was actually community reported ?

 15:39:38 <ogra_> oh, sorry, i'm blind .. just a master

 15:40:14 <bdmurray> casper shows up in software center fwiw

 15:40:16 <slangasek> bdmurray: how should we approach this to figure out where this problem is coming from?

 15:40:29 <slangasek> in software-center> doh

 15:40:48 <slangasek> bdmurray: can you open a bug report on software-center about getting that fixed?

 15:41:04 <bdmurray> slangasek: sure

 15:41:47 <ogra_> we could possibly make casper chack something like "is a bootloader configured" and make it become a no-op then

 15:41:55 <ogra_> *check

 15:41:58 <slangasek> hmm, seems to be a general problem

 15:42:02 <slangasek> 'fontconfig' also shows up in casper

 15:42:21 <bdmurray> ogra_: yes, I think something like that may help too

 15:42:40 <slangasek> ogra_: do you want to take that one?

 15:42:58 <ogra_> i can, sure ... i guess thats supposed to happen before release ? :)

 15:43:12 <ogra_> since SRUing it seems to make not much sense

 15:43:22 <slangasek> ogra_: best-effort

 15:43:25 <ogra_> k

 15:43:47 <slangasek> it still gives benefit if we get it in SRU, and it's not the highest priority issue

 15:44:03 <slangasek> btw, as far as bugs go... we have http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/rls-p-tracking-bugs.html down about where we want it, and if we're taking any more bugs that it's critical to fix for .0, they'll probably be so critical that we don't even need to track them on there :-P

 15:44:10 <ogra_> yeah, with luck people with casper installed get the updated version before their system breaks :)

 15:44:29 <slangasek> so how should we be tracking bugs that are priorities but that aren't tied to .0?

 15:44:37 <slangasek> rls-p-tracking, target to precise-updates?

 15:44:45 <ogra_> ++

 15:44:46 <cjwatson> I think so

 15:44:55 <slangasek> bdmurray: ^^ does that sound good to you?

 15:46:32 <bdmurray> slangasek: both? yes that's fine

 15:46:42 <slangasek> yeah, both

 15:48:08 <slangasek> bdmurray: any other new issues popping up?

 15:48:27 <bdmurray> bug 984593 was just reported

 15:48:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 984593 in Wubi "Wubi upgrade from 10.04.4 to 12.04 exceptions" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/984593

 15:48:56 <bdmurray> I haven't looked at it thoroughly yet

 15:50:04 <slangasek> so far I don't see anything wubi related in the bug... and the submitter broke it out into per-issue bugs for us already?

 15:50:19 <slangasek> i.e., all the issues he had look like upgrade issues, not wubi issues

 15:50:26 <bdmurray> I think they initially installed from wubi then upgraded to precise

 15:51:02 <slangasek> yep... I just don't see anything (yet) to make me think he actually had wubi-specific problems

 15:51:23 <slangasek> bug #984932 - hah

 15:51:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 984932 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "Ubuntu alternate OEM: main part of the panel missing during end-user configuration" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/984932

 15:51:28 <slangasek> cjwatson: ^^ missing image again? :)

 15:51:51 <cjwatson> hmm

 15:51:58 <slangasek> (oem-config vs. ubiquity?)

 15:52:17 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay, I'll dig into it and the related bugs more

 15:52:17 <cjwatson> different weirdness

 15:52:21 <slangasek> bdmurray: cheers

 15:52:29 <cjwatson> oem-config-gtk depends: ubiquity-frontend-gtk so I don't think it's missing image

 15:52:36 <slangasek> so does everyone have enough bugs to keep themselves feeling productive between now and release?

 15:52:41 <cjwatson> more than

 15:52:50 <slangasek> does anyone want to take some bugs from cjwatson? :P

 15:53:14 <stgraber> I'll take bug 984932

 15:53:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 984932 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Precise) "Ubuntu alternate OEM: main part of the panel missing during end-user configuration" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/984932

 15:53:23 <slangasek> stgraber: thanks

 15:53:32 <cjwatson> cool, that should be fine, just generally fielding installer things that come up in QA

 15:54:09 <slangasek> fwiw, if anyone's not finding bugs to work on, another source for them is http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/foundations-bugs/foundations-bugs-packages-hottest-bugs.html ... don't remember if this has been passed around to the team yet

 15:54:26 <slangasek> great report by bdmurray that shows the hottest bugs across all the foundations packages he's tracking

 15:54:41 <bdmurray> I'd hope I passed it around ;-)

 15:54:44 <cjwatson> bug 984989 needs attention (from me)

 15:54:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 984989 in grub-installer (Ubuntu) "grub install fails. installing from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb" [Critical,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/984989

 15:54:46 <slangasek> [LINK] http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/foundations-bugs/foundations-bugs-packages-hottest-bugs.html

 15:55:34 <barry> computer-janitor makes me sad ;)

 15:55:36 <slangasek> but you can safely assume that any of the bugs on that graph have a significant user impact and are worth fixing

 15:55:45 <slangasek> heh

 15:56:20 <slangasek> cjwatson: rls-p-tracking?

 15:56:23 <ev> ooooh jquery

 15:56:34 <bdmurray> sssh

 15:56:39 <cjwatson> slangasek: why not, added

 15:56:40 <ev> that's going to get a shouty response

 15:56:45 <ev> bdmurray: ;)

 15:57:19 <slangasek> ev: grandfathered :P

 15:57:45 <ev> heh

 15:58:14 <slangasek> don't worry, I'll take the heat for the graph not being suitable for integrating into our webapps

 15:58:14 <ev> there's always d3.js...

 15:58:47 <bdmurray> slangasek: you'll take the heat for the heat graph? ;-)

 15:58:53 <slangasek> I will!

 15:59:05 <slangasek> bdmurray: any other bugs?

 15:59:14 <bdmurray> not that I know of yet

 15:59:16 <ev> so I've just discovered that if you download and run wubi when you have a cd in the drive, you now helpfully get the autorun menu

 15:59:32 <ev> this is probably my fault

 15:59:38 <slangasek> !!

 15:59:41 <slangasek> fix it fix it

 16:00:07 <ev> my whole day has been fixing things! Can't I just break things for a little while?

 16:00:18 <slangasek> no, break things on your own time

 16:00:28 <ev> lol, damn

 16:00:31 <slangasek> preferably in some other OS ;)

 16:00:36 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:00:38 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:00:54 <cjwatson> who's going to the release sprint from our team?

 16:00:58 <ev> would still appreciate your collective feedback on that email I sent

 16:01:01 <cjwatson> I believe I am

 16:01:07 <ev> o/

 16:01:08 <slangasek> infinity is

 16:01:33 <cjwatson> hm, looks like I need to ask about accom

 16:01:53 <ev> who's going to be here not from our team? Rick and Kate?

 16:02:09 <ev> and presumably andy for comedy value

 16:02:16 <slangasek> heh

 16:02:37 <cjwatson> Pete too

 16:02:45 <ev> awesome!

 16:03:57 <ev> cjwatson: skaet and I are going to block out some time at the release sprint to discuss the crashdb website design. Care to join us?
