 14:02:42 <smartboyhw> ;-)

 14:03:10 <balloons> [TOPIC] Previous Actions

 14:03:30 <balloons> I believe the only outstanding item is me to get the https://qa.ubuntu.com/ site fixed

 14:03:43 <smartboyhw> lol 3 weeks issue now:)

 14:03:45 <balloons> the ticket is still outstanding.. I'm still waiting :-(

 14:03:54 <balloons> it's going to take time

 14:04:32 <phillw> just have to keep reminding them :)

 14:04:45 <balloons> yep

 14:04:49 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:04:51 <balloons> ok, so moving along then

 14:05:12 <balloons> [ACTION] balloons to follow-up with ubuntu-qa website changes

 14:05:12 * meetingology balloons to follow-up with ubuntu-qa website changes

 14:05:21 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Updates

 14:05:51 <balloons> So updates for ubuntu :-) Well knome has been working on visually enhancing our testcases

 14:05:52 <balloons> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-website/+bug/1039158

 14:05:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1039158 in Ubuntu QA Website "Add css to have dl/dt/dd show as numbered list for testcases" [Wishlist,Fix committed]

 14:06:02 <smartboyhw> Yes and I destroyed it:)(

 14:06:21 <smartboyhw> By not knowing it:(

 14:06:29 <smartboyhw> Sorry everybody:)

 14:06:46 <balloons> And I've been working on writing the new testcases for ubiquity and migrating the alt cases over as needed

 14:07:12 * smartboyhw goes and looks at the sandbox

 14:07:13 <balloons> In addition, focus is being given now to getting the flavors on board with re-using the ubuntu testcases and adding flavor specifics in there own testcases

 14:07:33 <kanliot> i sent phillw some testcases, i wonder if he saw em.  They were from the fedora team

 14:07:57 <phillw> kanliot: yes, I have them & the ideas from Julien to look throughj.

 14:10:45 <balloons> So, in addition, beta is behind us, ff is behind us.. things are starting to stabilize a bit

 14:10:55 <smartboyhw> Yay!

 14:11:15 * balloons checking schedule

 14:11:36 <balloons> Sept 27th is beta2

 14:11:53 <phillw> indeed, 2 weeks.

 14:11:55 <balloons> once that hits it will be quite an october full of testing

 14:12:02 <balloons> :-)

 14:12:18 <smartboyhw> ;0

 14:12:52 <balloons> I think that's it for updates themselves.. any questions before we move on?

 14:13:40 <smartboyhw> No.:)

 14:14:54 <balloons> [TOPIC] Other topics

 14:15:01 <balloons> that means the floor is open

 14:15:18 <phillw> o/

 14:17:57 <kanliot> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1046563

 14:17:59 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1046563 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager never appears on lubuntu precise" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 14:18:10 <kanliot> could use some help communicating with the maintainer

 14:18:12 <smartboyhw> kanliot: Please \o

 14:18:25 <smartboyhw> and wait for the chair (balloons' approval) before you speak:)

 14:18:25 <balloons> go ahead phillw

 14:18:27 <kanliot> am i outta order?

 14:18:33 <smartboyhw> kanliot: You are:)

 14:18:35 <balloons> kanliot, yes, but no worries

 14:19:15 <phillw> the x-bug affecting ppc appears to have been a red herring as that fix was for graphic chips that ppc computers do not have.

 14:20:40 <phillw> work is ongoing to add a command similar to the nomdeset command.

 14:21:52 <phillw> it does not seem, at this time, that the bug is reproducable in a Virtual Machine, so it is heavily reliant on the L-QA guys who have the hardware.

 14:21:56 <phillw> ..

 14:22:01 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:22:12 <balloons> thanks phillw .. that's good news

 14:22:16 <balloons> kanliot, go ahead

 14:22:30 <kanliot> ok bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1046563

 14:22:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1046563 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager never appears on lubuntu precise" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 14:22:42 <kanliot> need help communicating with the maintainer

 14:22:47 <kanliot> to help suggest solutions

 14:23:01 <smartboyhw> That's awkward weird

 14:23:44 <kanliot> pretty much update manager turned it'self off on lubuntu last month\

 14:24:37 <balloons> kanliot, really? phillw hear of others having the same issue?

 14:24:42 <balloons> that's really bizarre

 14:25:07 <kanliot> yeah i'm surprised that more people arent upset

 14:25:07 <balloons> basically, there's updates, but you'll never be prompted

 14:25:17 <kanliot> but i get upset about everything, so it's normal for me

 14:25:18 <balloons> did you check and make sure the settings to prompt are correct?

 14:25:19 <phillw> balloons: I'd have to fire up a VM, but it is confirmed by another tester

 14:25:24 <balloons> perhaps reset them?

 14:25:32 <balloons> phillw, ahh.. yes, we're all in quantal mode

 14:25:47 <smartboyhw> Me too I'm in quantal mode (and no Lubuntu ONLY)

 14:27:00 <phillw> balloons: I'll dig out from my other drive an 12.04 lubuntu and run the upgrades through it on a VM - but my internet speed is slow, so it will take quite a few hours :(

 14:27:20 <smartboyhw> Don't worry we do have time:)

 14:27:22 <balloons> phillw, no no.. I can confirm it much quicker than that

 14:27:26 <kanliot> it's pretty clearly broken

 14:27:28 <smartboyhw> balloons: :)

 14:27:29 <balloons> but the point is it's been confirmed

 14:27:42 <kanliot> you can run the update manager through the cron script when it's working

 14:27:45 <balloons> so I'm not worried about that.. just wanted to see how much debugging has been done

 14:27:50 <kanliot> and when it's broken, the cron script doesn nothing

 14:28:05 <kanliot> so reproducing isn't the problem

 14:28:18 <balloons> ok kanliot i'll bring this up and see if we can get someone to give feedback on it

 14:28:20 <balloons> thanks

 14:28:22 <kanliot> the problem is that all lubuntu people wont get updates if they upgrade to 12.04

 14:28:30 <kanliot> ty balloons

 14:28:34 <balloons> yw

 14:28:39 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:28:40 <balloons> smartboyhw, go ahead

 14:28:47 <smartboyhw> balloons: Just a small one

 14:28:50 <balloons> sure

 14:28:55 <smartboyhw> and a reminder only:)

 14:28:56 <smartboyhw> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Meetings/QA/20120905

 14:29:06 <smartboyhw> you forgotten to add it to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Meetings

 14:29:17 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:29:18 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:29:30 <phillw> smartboyhw: it is there, just waiting on balloons to fix the regex :P

 14:29:31 * balloons is booting lubuntu 12.04 to see what happens

 14:29:34 <smartboyhw> ;P

 14:29:51 <balloons> phillw, ohh right.. that regex.. my changes must not have saved

 14:29:55 <balloons> perhaps I never saved it

 14:29:56 <balloons> lol

 14:30:02 <phillw> he he.
