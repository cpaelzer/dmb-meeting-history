 22:02:50 <cjohnston> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 20 September 2012. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:03:08 <cjohnston> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off

 22:03:21 <cjohnston> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:03:31 <cjohnston> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:04:03 <s-fox> cjohnston,  add IdleOne  to voters :)

 22:04:11 <cjohnston> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:04:16 <cjohnston> #voters IdleOne

 22:04:16 <meetingology> Current voters: IdleOne cjohnston hggdh iulian micahg s-fox

 22:04:22 <IdleOne> thank you

 22:04:28 <s-fox> hehe

 22:04:30 <cjohnston> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:05:02 <cjohnston> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 22:12:45 <cjohnston> Next up... uros1

 22:12:49 <uros1> hello from Belgrade, is midnight here btw

 22:12:50 <cjohnston> Please introduce yourself

 22:12:59 <HazRPG> AnasEmad: Congrats dude :)

 22:13:33 <uros1> Well I`m ex journalist currently working for department of defence here in Serbia

 22:14:01 <uros1> and only Ubuntu user in department for now, but still working on issue

 22:14:08 <iulian> Nice mixture. :)

 22:14:23 <uros1> In LoCo team i`m member for, let`s see 6 years

 22:14:32 <uros1> During last few years active member and sort of team manager and devoted presenter of Ubuntu

 22:14:47 <uros1> My wiki is here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Uros%20-Ubuntu%20member%20aspirant%20page%20-%202012

 22:16:22 <uros1> jono escaped...

 22:17:42 <hggdh> uros1: why do you have no testimonials for you?

 22:18:36 <uros1> missed that part...

 22:18:42 <uros1> my bad

 22:19:07 <hggdh> rather important part, this is where we get others to confirm what you have done

 22:19:37 <s-fox> uros1,  i would advise you ask members of your loco to support your application :)

 22:19:52 <uros1> myno problems, bojce: ping

 22:19:58 <cjohnston> preferably some who are also Ubuntu Members

 22:20:10 <uros1> yea no problem

 22:20:13 <uros1> bojce:

 22:20:35 <bojce> ok, uros1 is great spoksmen and one of reapy great ubuntu presenters

 22:20:59 <IdleOne> uros1: I am curious to know how come yours and bojce wiki page are almost identical, could you explain this?

 22:21:04 <uros1> for all bojce is coordinator of Serbian LoCo

 22:21:56 <uros1> we do work together

 22:22:47 <hggdh> is there anybody else in the room that can vouch for uros1 and bojce?

 22:22:51 <uros1> why is that any problem?

 22:23:21 <IdleOne> uros1: not a problem, just very uncommon

 22:23:42 <uros1> we are running team for four ears

 22:23:51 <uros1> two reapprovalls,

 22:24:22 <IdleOne> reapprovals? you mean you were Ubuntu member before?

 22:24:38 <uros1> no for LoCo team reapproval

 22:24:55 <cjohnston> my concern is that the pages look more like a team reapproval page than a membership page.. I want to see what each person has done, and the almost exact copy is a little too close for my comfort, especially when the only other person to speak on your behalf is the person who is also up for membership.

 22:25:23 <s-fox> how many people are in the loco that regularly attend  ?

 22:25:45 <uros1> where, on presentations or in meetings?

 22:26:02 <s-fox> both :)

 22:26:06 <uros1> on presentations average nomber is, about 50

 22:26:28 <uros1> in regular meetings on irc mabe 5 to 10 top

 22:26:36 <uros1> *mabe

 22:26:39 <s-fox> okay, does this group know you are applying for ubuntu membership /

 22:26:41 <s-fox> ?

 22:27:16 <uros1> yes shure its not secret

 22:28:00 <s-fox> did you ask them to support your application with comments on your wiki ?

 22:28:21 <uros1> no missed that part, sorry

 22:29:03 <s-fox> okay,  do you think you could see about that done for the next meeting? :)

 22:30:23 <uros1> what i think is: no problems to any kind of support from serbia team, we are one of the best europian teams

 22:30:50 <uros1> in small country we managed almost 5000 members and we work hard and god

 22:30:55 <IdleOne> I agree with s-fox. I would like to see testimonials from other members of the LoCo and also from current Ubuntu members.

 22:31:17 <uros1> I don`t se there is  a one small problem with testemonials what so ever

 22:31:48 <uros1> okay no problem

 22:32:04 <uros1> still maybe one, burt this is my problem

 22:32:22 <hggdh> uros1: the whole thing is we use the testimonials as an independent confirmation of the claims

 22:32:45 <uros1> yea, sure

 22:33:28 <hggdh> I tried to follow the pictures linked in the wiki, but they have no names associated

 22:33:43 <hggdh> and there is no picture of you in the wiki/LP...

 22:33:55 <uros1> my picture?

 22:34:08 <uros1> moment please

 22:34:46 <hggdh> uros1: what I was trying to do was match you with the pics. Now it is too late, I think

 22:35:00 <uros1> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntu-srbija/7989009305/in/photostream

 22:36:07 <uros1> ok i see

 22:36:16 <uros1> so no problems

 22:36:36 <uros1> lets vote and reject me

 22:37:12 <hggdh> we do not want to reject you. I propose we do *not* vote, and give you time to get the testimonials

 22:37:23 <s-fox> +1 hd

 22:37:24 <s-fox> f

 22:37:25 <s-fox> g

 22:37:29 <s-fox> +1 hggdh

 22:37:50 <cjohnston> uros1, and bojce... It looks like you two both do great work, but we are having a couple of problems as a board with being able to determine this. As we have discussed, it would be nice if both of you could get testimonials from people in your LoCo and also from others who are Ubuntu Members so that we have a little more to go off of. It would also be nice if you could each make some changes to your pages so that

 22:38:49 <bojce> ok, no problem

 22:38:51 <cjohnston> We do not want to vote on either of you today, in hopes that you will take the time prior to the next meeting to make a few small improvements to your applications, and then we will have a better picture of who you are and ask you to each reapply for the next meeting.

 22:39:52 <cjohnston> uros1 or bojce, do you have any other questions for us?

 22:39:55 <uros1> i think this is not fair, buit thats me

 22:40:28 <hggdh> uros1, bojce: please get some testimonials (and tags some names in the photos). The wikis are fantastic, but we *NEED* to have confirmation

 22:41:02 <hggdh> uros1: I guarantee you I want, with all my heart, to approve you

 22:41:32 <cjohnston> uros1: I didn't make it on my first application either.. the issue is that none of us know you, so it is very helpful to us to have others say things about you and the work that you do in order for us to gain insight into the things that we do not know.

 22:42:18 <uros1> Well I`m not stay awake to just tell you a story

 22:42:37 <uros1> so okay no problem

 22:42:42 <uros1> stay cool

 22:42:53 <cjohnston> Also, I'm not sure if the 12:00 utc board may be a better time fit for you?

 22:43:06 <uros1> working hour

 22:43:28 <cjohnston> I wondered if that was the case

 22:43:59 <hggdh> uros1: we are not going to vote now on you and bojce. We will keep you in the calendar for next meeting (in two weeks)

 22:44:09 <uros1> so let`s go to sleep, have god night or whatever time is

 22:44:36 <hggdh> uros1: you too. Sorry for this, but we need confirmations

 22:45:05 <bojce> ok, see you in 2 weeks

 22:45:08 <hggdh> bojce: as explained above, we are not going to vote on your application. Do you have any comments?

 22:45:11 <hggdh> heh

 22:45:28 <bojce> no, it`s ok...

 22:46:20 <cjohnston> Thanks to those who came, and congrats to AnasEmad
