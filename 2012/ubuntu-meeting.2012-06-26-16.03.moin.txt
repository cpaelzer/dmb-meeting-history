 16:04:18 <SpamapS> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:04:24 <SpamapS> arosales to follow up with rbask on finding the correct home for the Ubuntu Server blog.

 16:04:29 <SpamapS> Oh, and hi everybody ;)

 16:04:36 <arosales> rbasak: has made an IS request to have the blogged moved

 16:04:54 <arosales> SpamapS: so that in progress per rbasak's work

 16:05:03 <SpamapS> woot

 16:05:20 <Daviey> \o/

 16:05:21 <SpamapS> #action rbasak follow up on IS request to move Ubuntu Server blog

 16:05:21 * meetingology rbasak follow up on IS request to move Ubuntu Server blog

 16:05:25 <SpamapS> Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:05:27 <SpamapS> oops

 16:05:39 <SpamapS> Ctrl-C before Ctrl-Shift-V...

 16:05:40 <SpamapS> jamespage to follow up with hallyn on servercloud-q-server-iso-tests-review

 16:05:59 <Daviey> 16:53 < jamespage> hallyn, pre-empting my non-action from last weeks team meeting

 16:05:59 <jamespage> SpamapS, I've actually remembered what that is now

 16:06:02 <Daviey> 16:53 < jamespage> the check from the servercloud-q-server-iso-tests-review blueprint was related to checking the functionality of a VM post host upgrade

 16:06:03 <hallyn> inprogress :)

 16:06:05 <Daviey> 16:53 < jamespage> I think

 16:06:07 <Daviey> 16:53 < jamespage> i.e. if we upgrade precise->quantal do VM's keep functioning

 16:06:20 <jamespage> SpamapS, still inprogress

 16:06:27 <jamespage> but I really don't think we need to track it here

 16:06:38 <hallyn> nope

 16:06:41 <hallyn> thx

 16:06:48 <Daviey> sounds sensible to drop it's special treatment :)

 16:07:48 <SpamapS> sorry got lagged out for a second

 16:08:01 <SpamapS> utlemming to follow up with rbasak on getting armhf images using highbank

 16:08:15 <utlemming> SpamapS: in progress

 16:09:12 <SpamapS> do we need to check in on that again next week? Sounds like its getting handled

 16:09:32 <SpamapS> #topic Quantal Development

 16:09:33 <utlemming> if we need follow up next week, I'll raise it

 16:14:47 <SpamapS> anyone?

 16:15:13 <Daviey> hallyn: :D

 16:15:44 <SpamapS> moving on

 16:15:45 <SpamapS> Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:15:46 <Daviey> SpamapS: it's blocked on upstream

 16:16:05 <SpamapS> bad trend line.. ;)

 16:16:23 <arosales> some ARM server blueprint work items came in late

 16:16:46 <hallyn> I think I might need to go through some of my items and break them down further (and other people's lxc items)

 16:16:50 <arosales> I'll try to get the trend line readjusted to accommodate those late additions.

 16:16:54 <hallyn> they certainly are not half-day or less chunks, as we used to aim for

 16:17:19 <SpamapS> I don't know if we can hilight any yet

 16:17:27 <SpamapS> Seems like we're just now really getting definition on them

 16:17:56 <arosales> hallyn: let me know when if you add work items, so I can sync the trend line after that

 16:18:12 <SpamapS> so unless there's a specific blueprint people want to bring up.. I think we should probably move on

 16:18:22 <hallyn> arosales: ok (thanks, didn't know you wanted that)

 16:18:23 <arosales> be nice if we can get a good trend line representation by end of the week

 16:18:47 <SpamapS> indeed

 16:18:50 <SpamapS> #topic 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:19:14 <Daviey> desktop-q-xorg-general is essential for server quantal, apparently

 16:19:22 <Daviey> oops, sorry

 16:19:27 <jamespage> http://people.canonical.com/~jamespage/server-sru/precise-sru.html

 16:19:38 <jamespage> Not much to update since last weel

 16:20:09 <jamespage> quite a bit of stuff needs verification - especially around the recent nova upload - zul is there any specific arrangement around that?

 16:20:38 <zul> jamespage: errmm......ill talk to you offline about it

 16:20:41 <SpamapS> With Nova, we need to just make sure the CI tests pass with the packages from proposed

 16:20:46 <jamespage> zul, sure

 16:20:51 <jamespage> SpamapS, ack

 16:21:06 <adam_g> if thats all we need, we can have something referenced on them soon

 16:21:19 <SpamapS> Other than that, verification of any High/Criticals that have actual test cases would be appreciated, but is not necessary. The update will move to -updates when all the CI tests have worked.

 16:21:34 <Daviey> SpamapS / zul: can i be in the offline discussion please

 16:21:49 <zul> Daviey: yep

 16:21:59 <jamespage> if anyone wants to pickup a few SRU's then pick something from the 'Unassigned' list - based on priority would be good

 16:22:19 <jamespage> Daviey, smoser: we also need to sort out what MAAS is going to target for 12.04.1

 16:22:34 <Daviey> jamespage: yes.

 16:22:39 <smoser> roaksoax, clearly is involved in that, and "upstream"

 16:22:45 <jamespage> sure

 16:22:54 <Daviey> jamespage: it's semi-blocked atm fwiw

 16:23:05 <SpamapS> Anything else?

 16:23:10 <jamespage> nope

 16:23:18 <SpamapS> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:23:38 <SpamapS> Velocity is this week, with jcastro and hazmat attending, talking about Juju

 16:24:10 * jamespage <- Euro Python next week (talking about Juju)

 16:24:23 <SpamapS> Also OSCON is coming up July 16 - 20 in Portland, and we will have a juju charm school there

 16:24:59 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:25:07 <SpamapS> no hggdh today

 16:25:12 <SpamapS> Anybody else have QA news though?

 16:25:25 <Daviey> Sort of..

 16:25:39 <jamespage> QA team are starting to transfer ISO test cases to UTAH - meeting with gema next week to review

 16:25:41 <Daviey> If you have an opportunity to try the daily candidates for A2, please do so :)

 16:26:02 <Daviey> jamespage: Gema will be here?

 16:26:12 <jamespage> no not here - outside of this meeting

 16:26:20 <Daviey> jamespage: can i be pinged into that please?

 16:26:25 <jamespage> Daviey, sure

 16:26:36 <smoser> wait...

 16:26:36 <jamespage> later in the week

 16:26:42 <smoser> wait. daily candidates?

 16:26:46 <smoser> are we not expecting kernel upload still?

 16:26:50 <smoser> smb, ?

 16:26:56 <smb> done

 16:27:13 <smb> Kernel 3.5.0-2.2 has been uploaded to quantal-proposed (i386 ec2 issue)

 16:27:18 <smoser> and we have ISOs that have those in it?

 16:27:20 <smb> about 2 hrs ago

 16:27:33 <Daviey> no, not yet

 16:27:36 <SpamapS> good segue

 16:27:39 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:27:41 <smoser> well, then testing would make no sense.

 16:27:41 <Daviey> I will spin new images shortly

 16:27:47 <smoser> Daviey, can you do that?

 16:27:52 <smoser> the kernel is in -proposed

 16:27:58 <smb> Apart from ther quantal kernel... Finally the scheduler bug that tried to drive me crazy has been identified. A proper upstream fix is under discussion and testing.

 16:27:59 <smoser> so we wont even pick it up in cloud iamge builds.

 16:28:03 <SpamapS> Daviey: sorry thought you were done begging for ISO testers ;)

 16:28:04 <smb> ..

 16:28:04 <smoser> by design we do not pick up proposed.

 16:28:10 <Daviey> smoser: I'm on the hook for spinning cd's this week

 16:28:27 <Daviey> smb: have the bug number?

 16:28:32 <smoser> i guess i should have realized this change earlier, but did not.

 16:28:44 <smb> Daviey, of what. Things are a bit jumbled up... ;)

 16:28:58 <smoser> ie if we're using -proposed during the development cycle, then our cloud image builds will not pick from it, ever.

 16:29:03 <Daviey> smb: Do you have bug numbers for anything concerning you? :)

 16:29:19 <Daviey> smoser: Yes, same as cd images.

 16:29:33 <smb> bug 999755

 16:29:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 999755 in linux (Ubuntu) "Kernel crash in rb_next doing ohai loops" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/999755

 16:30:23 <smb> Otherwise nothing of immediate importance

 16:31:10 <SpamapS> Settled then?

 16:31:21 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)
