 18:03:50 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 18:03:55 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 18:04:10 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 18:04:36 <jdstrand> I've got more MIR auditing and pending updates

 18:05:13 <jdstrand> I should also be finished with the second iteration of aa-sandbox and send that to the list

 18:05:21 <jdstrand> mdeslaur is not here today

 18:05:26 <jdstrand> sbeattie: you're up

 18:05:35 <sbeattie> I'm on community this week.

 18:05:54 <sbeattie> I also have a couple of updates to finish testing and push out.

 18:06:22 <sbeattie> I also need to get the apparmor-dbus ppa going and review aa-sandbox.

 18:06:32 <sbeattie> that's it for me.

 18:06:43 <sbeattie> did micahg make it back in time?

 18:06:47 <jdstrand> sbeattie: I recommend holding off on that review til I submit again

 18:06:55 <sbeattie> yeah

 18:08:04 <jdstrand> I think he is not. he can jump in later if he comes back

 18:08:06 <tyhicks> I'll go

 18:08:16 <tyhicks> I'm handling triage this week

 18:08:38 <tyhicks> I just returned from a long vacation and I'm still catching up

 18:08:57 <tyhicks> Another couple hours and I should be back on top of everything

 18:09:28 <tyhicks> While I was out, I finished xmlrpc-c patches for CVE-2012-0876 and CVE-2012-1148

 18:09:29 <ubottu> The XML parser (xmlparse.c) in expat before 2.1.0 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with many identifiers with the same value. (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0876)

 18:09:30 <ubottu> Memory leak in the poolGrow function in expat/lib/xmlparse.c in expat before 2.1.0 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of crafted XML files that cause improperly-handled reallocation failures when expanding entities. (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1148)

 18:09:48 <tyhicks> I'll need to test those patches and try to get the updates out

 18:10:03 <tyhicks> I say 'try' because I'll be at the Linux Security Summit Thursday and Friday of this week

 18:10:18 <tyhicks> before I leave, i'm going to help jdstrand with a security audit

 18:10:22 <tyhicks> I think that's it for me

 18:11:00 <jjohansen> I guess I am up

 18:11:04 <tyhicks> jjohansen: yep, you're up

 18:12:32 <jjohansen> I need to finish up this the 2.8 port of the aa-dbus patches, and finish debugging the current set of kernel patches (rcu, fs update, ..), then I will be heading to Linux Security Summit for Thursday and Friday this week

 18:13:47 <jjohansen> that is it for me jdstrand back to you

 18:13:52 <jdstrand> thanks
