 16:02:37 <Daviey> #startmeeting

 16:02:37 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Dec 11 16:02:37 2012 UTC.  The chair is Daviey. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:02:37 <meetingology> 

 16:02:37 <meetingology> Available commands: #accept #accepted #action #agree #agreed #chair #commands #endmeeting #endvote #halp #help #idea #info #link #lurk #meetingname #meetingtopic #nick #progress #rejected #replay #restrictlogs #save #startmeeting #subtopic #topic #unchair #undo #unlurk #vote #voters #votesrequired

 16:02:59 <Daviey> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:03:15 <Daviey> move to http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server for release bug tracking

 16:03:27 <Daviey> jamespage: ^ this has been done?

 16:03:46 <jamespage> yep

 16:03:49 <Daviey> cool

 16:03:53 <Daviey> move to http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server for release bug tracking

 16:03:58 <Daviey> -- Who was this assigned to?

 16:03:59 <arosales> I updated the IRC command list just before the meeting

 16:04:20 <Daviey> arosales: eh?

 16:04:54 <arosales> Daviey: I think the first two were team info on tracking

 16:05:08 <Daviey> Oh.. well deprecate http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html hasn't been done

 16:05:10 <arosales> the 3rd action item was for me to update the irc command for server meetings

 16:05:40 <Daviey> So, i'll do that.. as i already have access.

 16:05:41 * arosales apologizes for not putting an owner with that.

 16:05:57 <Daviey> arosales: thanks... oh, don't worry

 16:06:01 <arosales> #action Daviey to deprecate http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:06:01 * meetingology Daviey to deprecate http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:06:01 <Daviey> roaksoax to review MAAS bugs, and sync with upstream

 16:06:02 <arosales> :-)

 16:06:08 <Daviey> heh

 16:06:26 <Daviey> so, roaksoax is out.. But it seems to be making progress

 16:06:43 <Daviey> hmm, no Robie

 16:07:53 <Daviey> rbasak, on the agenda was "roaksoax to review MAAS bugs, and sync with upstream" .. as he is out today.. are you close enough to know how this is going?

 16:08:16 <rbasak> I'm not familiar with the current packaging status, sorry

 16:09:03 <Daviey> rbasak: ok, thanks.. it was a long shot.

 16:09:23 <Daviey> #action Daviey to check with upstream how MAAS bugs are looking

 16:09:23 * meetingology Daviey to check with upstream how MAAS bugs are looking

 16:09:34 <Daviey> arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up servercloud area

 16:10:08 <Daviey> arosales: ^?

 16:10:53 <arosales> I think we may have missed the cut-off date

 16:11:18 * arosales to follow up with release team on getting the topic blueprints ack'ed back into the status tracker

 16:11:23 <Daviey> Hmm, that sounds crappy :)

 16:11:28 <arosales> I think release team freezes at feature freeze

 16:11:51 <Daviey> #action arosales to follow up with release team on getting the topic blueprints ack'ed back into the status tracker

 16:11:51 * meetingology arosales to follow up with release team on getting the topic blueprints ack'ed back into the status tracker

 16:12:01 <Daviey> arosales: thanks

 16:12:03 <arosales> I *think* that is the issue, but yes I will follow up :-)

 16:12:07 <Daviey> jamespage, arosales confirm if https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+upcomingwork should be used in ubuntu-server team IRC meeting for BP status

 16:12:35 <arosales> sorry /me didn't have an opportunity to sync up with jamespage

 16:12:40 <jamespage> we did not

 16:12:43 <arosales> anyone have any thoughts on that?

 16:12:57 <Daviey> ok

 16:13:02 <jamespage> but as we don't have stuff setup in status.ubuntu.com I think we should use that for the time being

 16:13:20 <Daviey> the trouble is ~ubuntu-server has too much noise

 16:13:29 <Daviey> it includes people that happen to be in the largely open team

 16:13:46 <Daviey> including juju-core, security and probably foundations issues

 16:14:17 <arosales> al valid points.

 16:14:22 <arosales> all, that is

 16:14:28 <arosales> so perhaps that is not a good approach

 16:15:27 <jamespage> I think its a useful view from individuals i.e. launchpad.net/~james-page/+upcomingwork

 16:15:32 <Daviey> yeah

 16:15:59 <Daviey> doesn't scale well for non canonical people tho. :).  Not sure how many non-canonical people signed up to wi's this cycle tho

 16:16:03 <Daviey> i know there are some.

 16:16:42 <Daviey> #topic Raring development

 16:16:52 <Daviey> Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:17:20 <Daviey> Is this not deprecated now?

 16:17:25 <Daviey> jamespage: ^?

 16:17:36 <jamespage> yes

 16:17:36 <jamespage> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:17:56 * Daviey notes to update the wiki

 16:18:07 <Daviey> bug 1081212

 16:18:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1081212 in maas (Ubuntu Quantal) "The address of the API in pserv.conf (tftp/generator) is http://localhost/MAAS/api/1.0/pxeconfig/" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1081212

 16:18:26 <jamespage> I need to catchup with the report author on that report - as I don't think its the full packageset.

 16:18:32 <Daviey> So.. I'm actually going to skip all the maas bugs.. as the best person to answer them is not here this week.

 16:18:50 <Daviey> jamespage: right

 16:18:51 <jamespage> Daviey, TBH they are all in hand upstream; so that is a good approach

 16:19:04 <jamespage> its just dependent on the 1.2 stablisation release being delivered

 16:19:06 <jamespage> ~Jan

 16:19:11 <Daviey> bug 1076747

 16:20:55 * jamespage hides

 16:21:03 * Daviey looks at the report date

 16:21:07 <jamespage> sorry - I started looking at that one and got distracted

 16:21:42 <Daviey> heh

 16:21:56 <Daviey> looks like it's in progress, with a patch needing forward porting?

 16:22:41 <jamespage> yeah

 16:22:46 <jamespage> hence why I hid

 16:22:50 <Daviey> heh

 16:23:02 * jamespage berates himself for being slack about that one

 16:23:07 <Daviey> heh

 16:23:10 <Daviey> bug 1066845 - zul?

 16:23:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1066845 in nova (Ubuntu Raring) "nova-novncproxy is not running; Suggest: novnc should be Depends" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1066845

 16:24:48 <ubottu> Daviey: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

 16:25:12 <Daviey> Any other bugs that are release trackable?

 16:25:38 <Daviey> ok

 16:25:40 <Daviey> Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html

 16:25:50 <jamespage> I'm sure there are plenty - please can everyone remember to raise tasks for raring - that way they get on the report

 16:25:58 <Daviey> 404 :)

 16:26:04 <Daviey> thanks jamespage

 16:26:11 <Daviey> so.. blueprints.

 16:26:21 <Daviey> smoser, jamespage and myself have been going through them

 16:26:37 <Daviey> Generally, they are looking good.. but there are a bunch that needed some work

 16:26:41 <Daviey> Comments were made

 16:26:51 <Daviey> (at least for the ones i am approver for)

 16:27:07 <Daviey> I didn't really dig into the ones arosales is approver for.. can you comment on yours?

 16:27:38 <arosales> we still need to properly spec out a few

 16:27:44 <arosales> but no comments here

 16:27:55 <Daviey> ok.

 16:28:09 <Daviey> so.. servercloud-r-openstack-docs - koolhead17.. needs work.. empty spec so far

 16:28:35 <Daviey> servercloud-r-openstack-sru - zul - is it rich enough in detail?

 16:28:45 <zul> yes

 16:29:01 <Daviey> are you certain? :)

 16:29:38 <Daviey> (hint)

 16:29:39 <Daviey> servercloud-r-userns - hallyn - requested to be dropped, merged with another.

 16:30:00 <hallyn> yup

 16:30:13 <Daviey> servercloud-r-virt-powerpc - BenC - Currently empty, if still null by EOW, will drop.

 16:31:02 <Daviey> servercloud-r-webscale - SpamapS - Think this needs a new owner?  Not yet confirmed with Clint, but assuming it does, any volunteer?

 16:31:23 <Daviey> (apply via a self addressed envelope to my PO BOX address)

 16:31:26 <jamespage> Daviey, throw that one at me; I'll hack it back and do the essentials

 16:31:34 <Daviey> j\o/)

 16:31:43 <smoser> nice, mr page.

 16:31:48 <Daviey> done.

 16:32:59 * jamespage gets the hachett out

 16:38:25 <dholbach> and obviously be there in #ubuntu-quality on Thursday

 16:38:26 <jamespage> would be nice to see everyone knock of at least one test; these are a good opportunity to put other things down for a few hours and focus on something specific

 16:38:47 <jamespage> thanks dholbach

 16:38:52 <Daviey> jamespage: Annnnnnd.. where can i find a list of tests that need writing ?

 16:40:11 <Daviey> \o/

 16:40:19 <Daviey> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:40:21 <smb> Not much to report this week. Done some pulling of Xen sercurity

 16:40:21 <smb> updates. Also updated the http://people.canonical.com/~smb/lucid-ec2-ng

 16:40:21 <smb> kernels after master had been updated. Did some testing on a c1.medium

 16:40:21 <smb> instance where I saw no issues. Have not heard any reports other than

 16:40:21 <smb> cc1 (=HVM) instance does not work which was not working with the ec2

 16:40:22 <smb> branch either. ;)

 16:40:24 <smb> ..

 16:40:34 <Daviey> wow, smb, as efficient as ever

 16:40:48 <smb> As long as I can prepare... :)

 16:41:12 <Daviey> There is an ongoing conversation of the kernel version for precise, next point release.  More details to follow next week.

 16:41:25 <Daviey> Any kernel questions for smb?

 16:41:25 <smb> Daviey, In that case without me

 16:41:45 <Daviey> smb: You are AWOL next week? :o

 16:41:54 <smb> Daviey, This is my last working week this year. :-P

 16:42:06 <Daviey> smb: glad to hear it :)

 16:42:08 <Daviey> smb: Are you looking to handle the xen merge?

 16:42:25 <smb> Daviey, which xen merge?

 16:42:34 <Daviey> THE xen merge.

 16:43:04 <smb> Daviey, You mean the xen-4.2 + qemu-dm which is uploaded to proposed?

 16:43:09 <Daviey> 4.1.3-3ubuntu1 -> 4.1.3-6

 16:43:35 <Daviey> or experimental ? http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/x/xen/current/changelog

 16:43:52 <smb> Daviey, Since when do we do this for SRU?

 16:44:04 <Daviey> I have NFI why it's in experimental.. could just be because Debian are in freeze.. or could be more

 16:44:13 <Daviey> smb: raring. :)

 16:44:22 <smb> Daviey, Well raring will be 4.2!

 16:44:32 <smb> And that is in proposed

 16:44:38 <Daviey> Ah!

 16:44:50 <Daviey> Again, more efficient than i could hope for.

 16:44:51 <Daviey> :)

 16:44:58 <smb> Heh

 16:45:03 <Daviey> Do we know what is keeping it in raring-proposed?

 16:45:51 <smb> I think it was xcp-xapi which zul was trying to thake care of

 16:46:07 <zul> yeah im almost done

 16:46:25 <Daviey> #ACTION zul and smb to work together to get xen in raring-release

 16:46:25 * meetingology zul and smb to work together to get xen in raring-release

 16:46:28 <Daviey> thanks

 16:46:32 <Daviey> Anything else for smb?

 16:46:44 <Daviey> thank you smb

 16:46:47 <Daviey> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:46:48 <rbasak> I'm working on verifying a quantal SRU, as ARM server installers are currently completely broken on quantal at the moment. This is bug 1084106. Nothing else to report. Any questions for me?

 16:46:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1084106 in The Eilt project "highbank installer broken" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1084106

 16:47:51 <Daviey> rbasak: maas & arm looking good?

 16:48:09 <Daviey> for the hope-for'd SRU's?

 16:48:48 <rbasak> I believe it was working well as of three days ago. I've not checked for my last change being SRU'd, but we don't need that until our next hardware enablement which I don't think will happen for a couple of weeks at least.

 16:49:03 <Daviey> Super, thanks rbasak. :)

 16:49:10 <Daviey> #topic Open Discussion

 16:49:16 <Daviey> Anything else pending?

 16:49:27 <zul> i still like turles

 16:50:01 * rbasak likes turles too

 16:50:19 <rbasak> (BTW, what are turles? :-P

 16:50:24 <m_3> turtles? huh?

 16:50:28 * TheLordOfTime yawns

 16:51:01 <smoser> rbasak, cloud-init SRU landed in precise-proposed

 16:51:04 <rbasak> \o/

 16:51:15 <Daviey> woot

 16:51:17 <rbasak> I did wonder about that

 16:51:18 <smoser> so the "arm mirror" stuff should "just owrk" now.

 16:51:23 <smoser> that is thanks to mr slangasek

 16:51:45 <rbasak> smoser: will you be dropping the ephemeral image hack when that's in?

 16:51:54 <smoser> that would make sense

 16:51:58 <rbasak> (in which case I'll want to test for a regression when you do)

 16:52:07 <smoser> anyone who wants to help test https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/cloud-init would be wonderful.

 16:52:10 <hallyn> pls to test new qemu packages in ppa:serge-hallyn/crossc in raring :)

 16:52:15 <smoser> (anything fix-committed needs testing)

 16:52:47 <rbasak> smoser: do you  have a -proposed daily cloud image or anything like that?

 16:53:11 * Daviey moves on?

 16:54:02 <smb> Daviey, got 7 minutes

 16:54:46 <Daviey> we can have a 6 minute party then

 16:54:51 <Daviey> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:55:00 <Daviey> Shall we have one in 2 weeks?

 16:55:06 <Daviey> or 3 weeks?

 16:55:23 <TheLordOfTime> two week's right in the middle of US holidays you know, not that there's many US people on the server team

 16:55:26 <Daviey> So xmas day, or new years day?

 16:55:49 <Daviey> 25th is 2 weeks, 1st is 3 weeks

 16:55:49 <TheLordOfTime> isnt xmas day a family day?  probably new years'll be more... logi...

 16:55:51 <TheLordOfTime> wait...

 16:56:18 <TheLordOfTime> ... i'd assume the 25th is just a bad date for the meeting, but the 1st isnt that much better...

 16:56:20 <Daviey> Okay, lets go for the 8th.. Wow.
