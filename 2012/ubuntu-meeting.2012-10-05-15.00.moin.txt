 15:01:41 <skaet> #topic Comments and Questions

 15:02:02 <highvoltage> skaet: stgraber and myself are at a hackfest so apologies for missing the Edubuntu notes

 15:02:29 <highvoltage> skaet: afaict there wasn't something specifically noteworthy to report this week

 15:02:50 <skaet> thanks highvoltage,   if there are issues,  bring it up today.  But glad things seem to be smooth.

 15:03:23 <skaet> usual conventions apply,  please raise hand 'o/', if you have question.

 15:03:23 <highvoltage> ok will do

 15:03:26 <skaet> welcome everyone

 15:03:36 <Riddell> hi

 15:03:54 <skaet> we're entering the final push of bug fixes before we go into final freeze next Tuesday.

 15:04:04 <seb128> skaet, (desktop -> I'm back from holidays so didrocks->-seb128)

 15:04:27 <skaet> Thanks seb,  sorry about that on the summary.

 15:04:36 <seb128> (np ;-)

 15:04:47 <skaet> any other corrections or additons to the list of status?

 15:04:58 <skaet> Daviey,  are you covering for arosales this week?

 15:05:56 <skaet> hmm... while we wait to hear from Daviey (and find out if there are any concerns on the server side)

 15:06:14 <skaet> want to know if anyone else has concerns not in the weekly status already they want to bring up?

 15:06:21 <skaet> key bug fixes needed,  etc.?

 15:06:22 <Daviey> skaet: yes

 15:06:53 <skaet> Thanks Daviey,   what's on the radar to land between now and Final Freeze?   anything critical?

 15:07:19 <Riddell> I've had a mysterious report of installs not finishing which I can't recreate - bug 1062180

 15:07:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1062180 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Quantal) "Ubiquity won't finish installation" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1062180

 15:07:37 <Daviey> skaet: I would be expecting at least one more maas upload (on cd), and various openstack uploads (archive only)

 15:08:03 <Daviey> There are a few bugs being caught at the moment, which are a little nasty

 15:08:22 <skaet> ok.   we have mozilla decision (and possible upload)  on Tuesday next week.   Can you avoid it?

 15:09:28 <skaet> ie.  can we get the maas issues mostly landed by EOD monday?

 15:11:44 <skaet> Daviey, ^?

 15:12:12 <Daviey> skaet: unlikely

 15:12:36 <Daviey> skaet: I wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of smallish things still trickling in towards the end of the week

 15:13:14 <skaet> Daviey, we're spinning release candidates up on Thursday, so SRU time after tuesday (Final Freeze),  unless they are release critical.

 15:13:21 <Daviey> right!

 15:13:43 <skaet> ..

 15:13:51 <Daviey> (thanks)

 15:14:06 <Laney> is freeipmi in a position to be MIRed?

 15:14:11 <skaet> plars, have you seen any sign of bug Riddell mentions?

 15:14:17 <Laney> Daviey: ^

 15:14:28 * plars looks

 15:14:34 <plars> doesn't sound familiar

 15:14:57 <skaet> Riddell,  anyone else able to confirm it?

 15:15:25 <plars> I just finished up an amd64 installation a few minutes ago, and I know psivaa has done some this morning also, but we'll keep an eye out for it

 15:15:31 <skaet> (and yeah if there is something weird going on, and its common,  nows the time to know ;) )

 15:15:36 <Riddell> skaet: xnox had no initial ideas

 15:15:37 <skaet> thanks plars.  :)

 15:15:47 <jibel> plars, Riddell skaet sounds like bug 1059619

 15:15:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1059619 in grub-installer (Ubuntu Quantal) "Installation hangs on: grub-mount /dev/sdb1 /var/lib/os-prober/mount" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1059619

 15:16:45 <Riddell> jibel: mm could be, I'll pass that to the reporter

 15:17:07 <skaet> thanks jibel,  Riddell

 15:17:10 <skaet> ..

 15:17:13 <plars> jibel: you have a reliable way to reproduce?

 15:17:37 <jibel> plars, yes my 2 laptops

 15:18:09 <Daviey> Laney: it was in progress, checking state.. Needed one more fix.

 15:20:21 <Daviey> (I'm sure it will be fixed today)

 15:20:22 <Daviey> ..

 15:21:04 <Laney> ok, just wondering as that component mismatch has been around for quite some time ..

 15:21:53 <Daviey> .. but not forgot.

 15:22:08 <skaet> ogra_, plars - how are the arm desktop and server test results looking?

 15:22:20 <ogra_> pretty good i think

 15:23:10 <plars> I'm looking at desktop right now

 15:23:13 <plars> about to take a look at server

 15:23:28 * ogra_ doesnt expect any regressions

 15:23:46 <ogra_> it will be as speedy and blingy as it was in beta on desktop :)

 15:23:47 <plars> I was just discussing an audio issue, and a keyboard issue with ogra_ but nothing affecting installation on desktop at the moment

 15:24:12 <plars> for server, I had an issue with the keyboard not working at all, and I know that some people have reported that their hdmi monitor doesn't work on install with -server

 15:24:16 <plars> mine works though

 15:24:18 <skaet> plars,  thanks.   Can you send an update to your weekly status that summarizes the results of the testing on arm after you finish looking?  Want to make sure we all have a clean picture of what should be good, and what needs to be release noted.

 15:24:38 <plars> skaet: yep

 15:24:44 <skaet> thanks plars!  :)

 15:24:46 <ogra_> plars, yeah, as paolo just said, kbd should be fixed ... wrt HDMI i would blame the monitors

 15:24:48 * Daviey doesn't write regressive code.

 15:25:09 * ogra_ knows there are still a few that dont work with the driver due to broken EDIDs

 15:25:10 <ogra_> ..

 15:25:15 <skaet> ..

 15:26:18 <skaet> seb128,  are we likely to get a fix for fontconfig in next day or so,  so we can put ubuntu medium font back in?

 15:27:10 <seb128> skaet, not that I know about, we don't have anyone in desktop who knows about fonts/fontconfig

 15:27:15 <seb128> not sure if foundation,slangasek is looking at that

 15:27:20 <Laney> there's a fontconfig fix needed?

 15:27:36 <ogra_> longstanding ...

 15:27:40 <seb128> Laney, the libreoffice issue seems to be a fontconfig issue

 15:27:56 * skaet nods

 15:28:03 <seb128> https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&id=38737

 15:28:38 <Laney> I thought somebody worked around that in the font itself

 15:28:58 <slangasek> seb128: we don't have anyone in foundations who knows about fontconfig either

 15:29:01 <seb128> (slangasek, sorry, I keep thinking  (wrongly) that you maintain fontconfig as well as freetype in Debian which is why I listed your name ;-)

 15:29:05 <slangasek> :)

 15:29:18 <seb128> Laney, who is working on the font?

 15:29:28 <skaet> popey,  is thre anyone in your organization that can help here?

 15:29:32 <seb128> Laney, well, Sweetshark wrote:

 15:29:34 <seb128> "

 15:29:34 <seb128> this seems not to be an issue in LibreOffice, but in fontconfig. If I read that

 15:29:34 <seb128> bug right, it would need to be fixed either in fontconfig or workarounded in

 15:29:34 <seb128> the Ubuntu font itself, but not in LibreOffice." "

 15:30:06 <popey> skaet, we had one guy looking at it, but unfortunately had vacation before he could get to the bottom of it

 15:30:06 <seb128> Laney, skaet: I've no clue who is in charge of the font or could "workaround in the font itself" there

 15:30:12 <slangasek> seems to me that this should be reverted in the font then

 15:30:19 <popey> then it was passed to Sweetshark to investigate

 15:30:43 <slangasek> it seems very unlikely we're going to fix it on the software side before release

 15:30:43 <popey> we have nobody internally who can work directly on the font - we have to contact DM

 15:30:44 <seb128> popey, yeah, Sweetshark concluded that there is nothing libreoffice could do there

 15:30:49 <popey> yeah

 15:30:58 <seb128> and he has been fighting lo-appmenu stuff the whole week

 15:31:10 <slangasek> popey: is there a compelling reason NOT to revert the medium change?

 15:31:13 <popey> yes, he's busy, we were lucky to get a slice of him

 15:31:18 <Laney> slangasek: it already has been

 15:31:30 <slangasek> oh, then what's still outstanding for the release?

 15:31:43 <Laney> putting it back

 15:31:44 <slangasek> I thought this was only about the medium-weight font

 15:31:44 <popey> we would like it in, that's all

 15:31:45 <skaet> trying to get all the bugs fixed.

 15:31:46 <seb128> slangasek, I think the sabdfl was pushing on the bug for us to resolve the issues and restore the font

 15:31:47 <slangasek> ah

 15:31:57 <popey> that's right

 15:32:26 <seb128> I'm not sure how unhappy he and others are going to be if that's not the case...

 15:32:47 <seb128> ..

 15:33:21 <skaet> popey,  will you take it up with your management and see if we can come up with other options for getting this sorted?

 15:33:29 <popey> yup

 15:33:34 <skaet> Thanks popey

 15:33:51 <Laney> one second

 15:33:54 <Laney> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/+bug/1054204

 15:33:55 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1054204 in ubuntu-font-family-sources (Ubuntu Quantal) "Libreoffice chooses incorrect font weight" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 15:34:00 <Laney> That's the bug with the workaround

 15:34:32 <Laney> but I understand that we don't have the preferred form for modification for the font, so the change had to be done some other way

 15:36:02 <Laney> ..!

 15:36:57 <skaet> Laney,  that looks to me like the workaround could be applied,  and we'd get by this impass.   Am I missing something?>

 15:37:08 <seb128> we should probably defer to next cycle at this point

 15:37:24 <Laney> skaet: I think he did some binary hacking to do it

 15:37:29 <Laney> it's not really very satisfactory

 15:37:30 <seb128> hey rickspencer3

 15:37:37 <rickspencer3> hey seb128

 15:37:44 <Laney> seb128: yeah, if that's an option then we should indeed

 15:37:58 <seb128> I was asking rickspencer3 how problematic that is if we don't get the font in quantal

 15:37:59 <Laney> we fixed the Qt side at least

 15:38:16 <rickspencer3> hi

 15:38:23 <Laney> ahoy

 15:38:28 <skaet> rickspencer3, opinion?

 15:38:28 <seb128> right, progress, it doesn't seem likely the libreoffice issue will be sorted out soon though...

 15:38:47 <rickspencer3> I think it would be a shame not to include it after all that was invested in it, but it doesn't sound ready

 15:38:50 <Laney> perhaps mirv could enlighten us about his fix

 15:38:58 <Laney> it does seem a bit sad that we're not really able to modify the font

 15:39:40 <rickspencer3> skaet, does that help?

 15:40:12 <skaet> rickspencer3, yes it doesn't sound ready.   Any thoughts on ways we can get it ready in next few days?

 15:40:37 <rickspencer3> skaet, not really, it just sounds too late to get it integrated

 15:40:57 <rickspencer3> if it's not working with Libre Office when we drop it in, it just seems like we need to move on to release without it

 15:41:02 <skaet> rickspencer3, ok.  putting it on the shelf then for R,  rather than introducing bugs into quantal.

 15:41:19 <skaet> ..

 15:41:27 <rickspencer3> if we start going around fixing this, fixing that, I fear we will get a cascade of knock on regressions

 15:41:42 * skaet nods

 15:41:49 <rickspencer3> this would distract us from perhaps fixing critical bugs

 15:41:51 <rickspencer3> sorry

 15:41:58 <rickspencer3> I just think we need to move on

 15:41:58 <skaet> ..?

 15:42:14 <rickspencer3> (sorry to the people who worked hard on it and are passionate about it, I mean)

 15:42:30 <popey> sorry, asked pmcgowan to join us

 15:43:38 <popey> pmcgowan, feeling is introducing this back in means we divert focus from other critical bugs right now.. and we don't have a fix for this, and no obvious way to get one

 15:43:51 <Daviey> Did i missunderstand that it sounds like we have a solution, but involves uploading binary modification..  Is this not a reasonable stop-gap?

 15:44:51 <seb128> is that a solution or a workaround?

 15:45:02 <seb128> how confident are we that there are not going to be other issues?

 15:45:24 <seb128> to me it just seems reality late and we might need to focus the resources on blocker issues next week

 15:45:25 <seb128> ..

 15:46:20 <pmcgowan> sorry to arrive late

 15:46:41 <pmcgowan> best result would be to fomrulate a real fix for LO or fontconfig once and for all

 15:47:04 <pmcgowan> do you feel the current symptom is critical enough to not ship with?

 15:47:51 <Laney> we "just" don't have the medium weight

 15:47:57 <Laney> I think it's fine to defer

 15:48:18 <pmcgowan> would we add the font back in SRU with a fix to LO?

 15:48:42 <Laney> it's not LO that needs to be fixed, but fontconfig

 15:48:54 <pmcgowan> fine

 15:49:21 <Laney> I'm not sure that is something the SRU team would accept though

 15:49:28 <Laney> slangasek can maybe comment

 15:49:44 <seb128> pmcgowan, do you think it's important? SRU worth?

 15:50:55 <pmcgowan> there are elements of the UI which never were able to match design because of this, and seems to me an issue that could be resolevd safely by SRU

 15:51:17 <rickspencer3> it's nice that our quality situation is such that we can consider changes like this at this late game, but realistically, there are still other moving parts

 15:51:17 <slangasek> Laney: I think it would have to be a sadfl in to do it as an SRU

 15:51:23 <pmcgowan> you all know the history, its been 2 years and no fix to fontconfig

 15:51:33 <rickspencer3> I think introducing this is too much churn

 15:51:35 <slangasek> because that's not sanely regression-testable

 15:52:00 <rickspencer3> let's ensure that we fix this properly in 13.10, get it banked early in 13.10, and move on

 15:52:16 <Laney> 13.04? :-)

 15:52:19 <rickspencer3> dang it

 15:52:22 <rickspencer3> lol

 15:52:25 <skaet> :)

 15:52:25 <rickspencer3> yeah

 15:52:37 <Laney> fine. Speaking of moving on:

 15:52:38 <Laney> ..

 15:52:45 <pmcgowan> oh well

 15:53:33 <skaet> Thanks all,  I think we have our plan for 12.10 and this issue, unless sabdfl wants to weigh in.

 15:53:38 <skaet> ..

 15:54:04 <skaet> anyone else have other critical bug issues to bring up to discuss before I end the meeting?

 15:55:32 <skaet> just want to say thank you to everyone involved for all the hard work and passion on getting 12.04 ready.

 15:55:50 <smartboyhw> skaet, did you say anything wrong? 12.10 right?

 15:55:51 <ogra_> and 12.10 too

 15:55:54 <Riddell> that was 6 months ago :)

 15:56:09 <skaet> yes.  12.10

 15:56:55 <skaet> There will be a meeting next week,  and then there will be a break until they start up for 13.04.
