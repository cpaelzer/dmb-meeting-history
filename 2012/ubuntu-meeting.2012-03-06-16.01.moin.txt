 16:01:46 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01:57 <roaksoax> there're no previous actions

 16:02:01 <roaksoax> according to the wikipage

 16:02:05 <roaksoax> so let's move on

 16:02:06 <highvoltage> czajkowski: thanks

 16:02:15 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Precise Development

 16:02:19 <roaksoax> Daviey: you are up

 16:02:37 <Daviey> roaksoax: fancy driving it yourself?

 16:03:00 <roaksoax> Daviey: sure

 16:03:05 <rbasak> I think this topic should be split. There's quite a lot in it.

 16:03:10 <roaksoax> so let's go thru the release bugs!

 16:03:17 <zul> yaay

 16:03:18 <roaksoax> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:03:29 <Daviey> rbasak: sure, make a proposal at AOB

 16:03:41 <roaksoax> bug #924739 -- adam_g any updates?

 16:03:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 924739 in squid3 (Ubuntu Precise) "after upgrade from oneiric to precise, previous squid config unused, cannot be used when relocated" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/924739

 16:04:00 <roaksoax> adam_g: has the newer version that got merged from Debian fixed anything?

 16:04:21 <adam_g> roaksoax: there is not going to be a fix in debian as far as i can tell, i have some direction on possible solutions

 16:04:49 <justinlw> o/

 16:05:10 <adam_g> roaksoax: its not going to be seamless in any case, but we can try to make it obvious to users whats happening when we transition their proxy

 16:05:19 <Daviey> sounds great!

 16:05:26 <Daviey> well, "ok"

 16:05:55 <adam_g> i added some notes to the bug about possible routes we can take, anyone interested should weigh in

 16:06:05 <roaksoax> adam_g: alright then, I guess once we release backports are gonna be the way to go here until everything is supported

 16:06:30 <Daviey> next?

 16:06:35 <roaksoax> so let's move on bug #883988

 16:06:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 883988 in glance (Ubuntu Precise) "db migration failing when upgrading glance - trying to create existing tables" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/883988

 16:07:03 <roaksoax> adam_g / zul any of you taking care of it?

 16:07:04 <adam_g> roaksoax: for this one upstream has deferred it to their next cycle, best solution IMHO is to carry a patch to disable that autocreation of tables, which is what the other openstack components do already

 16:07:28 <roaksoax> adam_g: would you take care of it then?

 16:07:42 <Daviey> adam_g: your plan sounds sane... but we'll need a debconf warning i think

 16:07:49 <adam_g> roaksoax: yes, ill import the patch that was already proposed to do that and include it in our packaging this week

 16:08:07 <roaksoax> adam_g: awesome!

 16:09:02 <roaksoax> who's taking care of it/who will, are you Daviey ?

 16:09:12 <Daviey> roaksoax: I hoped upstream were going to TBH.

 16:09:27 <roaksoax> Daviey: lets not get our hopes up :)

 16:09:31 <Daviey> roaksoax: We don't need to panic about it right now

 16:16:29 <justinlw> there is a patch ... of sorts... I don't think it's a fix, per se, but

 16:19:11 <roaksoax> zul / adam_g ?

 16:19:32 <zul> pending

 16:19:40 <roaksoax> and I guess bug #901881 is related too

 16:19:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 901881 in glance (Ubuntu) "nova and glance should depend on python-keystone" [Low,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/901881

 16:20:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 887186 in orchestra (Ubuntu) "squid proxy big and small buckets not functioning correctly" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/887186

 16:20:26 <roaksoax> Not a worry just yet for orchestra, as we are changing just squid to squid-deb-proxy for MaaS

 16:20:39 <roaksoax> I'll update accordingly

 16:20:43 <Daviey> roaksoax: dropping tracking of it

 16:21:06 <roaksoax> but this should also not longer be an issue withsquid in precise anymore

 16:21:15 <Daviey> cool

 16:21:17 <roaksoax> bug #928501

 16:21:18 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 928501 in ebox (Ubuntu) "Precise will ship totally broken ebox packages" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/928501

 16:21:29 <roaksoax> SpamapS: any updates?

 16:21:35 <Daviey> jamespage: Were you looking at that aswell?

 16:21:46 <jamespage> Daviey: no but I can help out if need be

 16:22:06 <Daviey> jamespage: ah, confusing it with another.

 16:22:07 <SpamapS> Yes I will discuss it later in the meeting

 16:22:10 <jamespage> I dealt with resara server

 16:22:14 <Daviey> ah yes

 16:22:31 <roaksoax> awesome then. Last bug is duplicated so won't touch it

 16:22:38 <Daviey> super

 16:22:46 <SpamapS> blueprints?

 16:22:47 <roaksoax> ScottK: what's the bug number for the issue you want us to keep track of?

 16:23:00 <ScottK> Bug 930916

 16:23:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 930916 in amavisd-new (Ubuntu) "amavis start-stop script fails to stop amavisd" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/930916

 16:23:13 <ScottK> In general though I think the package needs checking over.

 16:23:38 <Daviey> nice catch SpamapS

 16:23:41 <ScottK> I don't think the postfix-amavis stuff is working, but have no time to look into it.

 16:23:45 <roaksoax> does anyone care to work on it?

 16:24:01 <roaksoax> this seems that it

 16:24:17 <Daviey> I wonder if Ivoks has capacity, he has history in that stack

 16:24:30 <roaksoax> it seems that a fix has been release in Debian, but yet, we would still need the package review

 16:24:33 <Daviey> Any other issues that should be tracked?

 16:24:51 <robbiew> chef and ohai are broken...we might need to punt them :/

 16:25:21 <Daviey> :(

 16:25:23 <SpamapS> Unless somebody wants to step up and fix them .. like.. now

 16:25:35 <Daviey> roaksoax: Want to go over blueprints?

 16:25:44 <roaksoax> Daviey: sure

 16:25:55 * robbiew has sent mail to maintainers..waiting on response...will keep tabs on it

 16:26:06 <SpamapS> robbiew: should we tag that one with the release tag?

 16:26:10 <Daviey> SpamapS: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-juju-charm-testing is that still progressing?

 16:26:29 <SpamapS> Daviey: actually yes. Just slowly. :-P

 16:26:39 <Daviey> SpamapS: likely to make releae?

 16:26:51 <Daviey> (nothing there is release schedule tied, is it?)

 16:26:57 <SpamapS> Daviey: there's really nothing left to put in the release of Ubuntu. Its documentation and test writing.

 16:27:07 <Daviey> right

 16:27:09 <Daviey> super!

 16:27:13 <Daviey> adam_g: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openstack-charms ?

 16:27:22 <SpamapS> Daviey: I'm more worried about the juju enhancements than the testing stuff.

 16:27:32 <SpamapS> But that does seem to be trickling into juju trunk.

 16:27:57 <adam_g> Daviey: i'd like to get to the swift charms rewrite this cycel for sure, but thinking the others may need to wait (and are not tied to release schedule anyway)

 16:28:05 <Daviey> SpamapS: right!

 16:28:29 <Daviey> SpamapS: I know robbiew is aware of Subordinate and Constraint seemingly not ready yet.

 16:28:35 <Daviey> Do you know the status of that?

 16:28:45 <robbiew> SpamapS: no specific bug yet to tag...just anecdotal information...will get that resolved though ;)

 16:29:05 <Daviey> adam_g: ssl migration would be nice..

 16:29:05 <robbiew> Daviey: ack...I believe it's in review still

 16:29:42 <Daviey> cool

 16:29:53 <Daviey> zul: do we still neen openvswitch in main?

 16:30:06 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-openvswitch-mir

 16:30:25 <zul> Daviey: yeah there some bits in openstack that use it, but i dont think its a priority

 16:30:28 <SpamapS> Do we need to look at supplementing the MIR team? Would they accept one of us to help with their backlog?

 16:30:55 <Daviey> roaksoax: Do you want to speak with aquette about deferring some (most?) of https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cloud-power-management ?

 16:31:06 <roaksoax> Daviey: will sure do

 16:31:09 <Daviey> SpamapS: I've already tried to make progress there.

 16:31:48 <Daviey> I think https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-kronos is going to be frozen at current state

 16:32:00 <Daviey> SpamapS: CEPH status?

 16:32:04 <SpamapS> https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir/+subscribedbugs .. looks like about 30+ pending review

 16:32:08 <SpamapS> Daviey: waiting on MIR

 16:32:09 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-ceph

 16:32:39 <Daviey> Any other blueprint questions?

 16:32:55 <SpamapS> servercloud-p-cloudutils

 16:33:29 <Daviey> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-p-cloudutils

 16:33:40 <SpamapS> Medium.. a few TODO's left.. seems a candidate for postponing

 16:33:44 <Daviey> Hmm

 16:33:52 <Daviey> I'm not sure it's tied to release that?

 16:34:04 <SpamapS> ubuntu-cloudimg-query ships in Ubuntu

 16:34:13 <Daviey> It's mostly implementing API infra, server side?

 16:34:29 <Daviey> SpamapS: right, but that can still work with v1 API

 16:34:33 <Daviey> utlemming / smoser ?

 16:35:21 <Daviey> SpamapS: What is the status of PHP?

 16:35:27 <smoser> at the moment it would appear that ubuntu-cloudimg-query will ship without query2 support.

 16:35:39 <smoser> which is not ideal, but it is functional.

 16:35:46 <SpamapS> Daviey: ugh

 16:35:48 <Daviey> works for me.

 16:35:52 <smoser> the /query interface isnt going away.

 16:36:00 <SpamapS> Daviey: so, basically *everybody* wants us to ship PHP 5.4.0

 16:36:16 <SpamapS> Daviey: but we have been firm at sticking with Suhosin .. which is not available yet for 5.4.0

 16:36:16 <Daviey> SpamapS: I found on the internets that you were investigating it again

 16:36:41 <SpamapS> Daviey: Debian dropped Suhosin, but our security team would prefer that we don't.

 16:36:48 <Daviey> SpamapS: Is it significant work to port it?

 16:37:00 <SpamapS> Daviey: so, I'm emailing the Suhosin maintainers asking them for a status update. It was promised 2 months ago.

 16:37:01 <Daviey> SpamapS: Have a bug as to where/why Debian dropped it?

 16:37:12 <SpamapS> Daviey: I can dig it out. Its in the changelog of 5.3.10

 16:37:18 <Daviey> ah, ok, thanks

 16:37:44 * Daviey passes the steering wheel back to the chair.

 16:37:56 <roaksoax> alright then. Should we move on then?

 16:38:07 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:38:29 <SpamapS> negronjl is hosting a charm school next Monday, and it looks like I'll be joining him

 16:38:46 <SpamapS> http://charmschoolsv.eventbrite.com/

 16:38:49 <roaksoax> awesome!

 16:39:23 <arosales> SpamapS: you and jcastro are also hosting a webinar on Thursday (March 8th), correct?

 16:39:46 <SpamapS> YES

 16:39:58 <roaksoax> right on!

 16:40:03 <SpamapS> http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2012/02/juju-charm-school-webinar-march-8th/

 16:40:11 <SpamapS> http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/6793/41933

 16:40:29 <roaksoax> awesome then. So I guess no more upcoming events. Let's move on

 16:40:32 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:40:35 <roaksoax> hggdh: you are up

 16:40:53 <hggdh> ..

 16:41:25 <roaksoax> hggdh: you remembered something you'd like to share?

 16:41:25 <hggdh> I got an email from Sean asking about the UEC machines; I answered & copied Daviey

 16:41:26 <hggdh> ..

 16:41:47 <roaksoax> alright

 16:41:49 * hggdh just wanted to make sure this is known

 16:42:00 * Daviey hasn't read this?

 16:42:21 <hggdh> you were copied in my reply... routed to /dev/null? ;-)

 16:42:22 <Daviey> ah, i see it

 16:42:32 <roaksoax> alright then. Let's move on

 16:42:35 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:42:36 <Daviey> nah, in my Boring folder :)

 16:42:45 <roaksoax> smb: ^^

 16:42:47 <smb> There is bug 944923 which I could use utlemming's help in trying to gather ec2 info. At least this seemed to be there even with a natty kernel (just without lockup warnings) and I cannot see it in any of my local setups. Then since the upgrade from oneiric to precise on my orchestra box seemed to have gone not that well, I wanted to do some clean install upgrades in Xen VMs, which brought up another issue. It seems pxeboot does not work with

 16:42:47 <smb> the e1000 emulation. Still digging there but it seems the ipxe rom we have has no pci id info.

 16:42:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 944923 in linux (Ubuntu) "[EC2:cg1.4xlarge] CPU#0 stuck for 23s! [migration/0:6] __do_softirq+0x60/0x210" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/944923

 16:43:04 <smb> ..

 16:43:21 <roaksoax> utlemming: ^^

 16:43:36 <utlemming> smb: sure...lets sync up after

 16:43:42 <smb> utlemming, ack

 16:43:54 <roaksoax> alright, unless there's something else you'd like to brin up smb, then we can move on

 16:44:02 <smb> nope

 16:44:04 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:44:15 <roaksoax> rbasak: you are next

 16:44:17 <rbasak> openmpi1.5 packages are now in the archive, alongside openmpi (1.4). Testing from stakeholders would be appreciated, especially as the test suite is not open source.

 16:44:17 <rbasak> Nothing else to report.

 16:44:19 <smoser> wait, there was one other thing smb said

 16:44:25 <smoser> for hallyn

 16:44:34 <smoser> e1000 emulation and pxe boot

 16:44:43 <smoser> smb, please open a bug on that.

 16:44:58 <smb> smoser, sure

 16:45:10 <smb> smoser, Right now debugging the build

 16:45:24 <Daviey> rbasak: so, you have versioned rdepends aswell?

 16:45:25 <roaksoax> awesome, let's move on

 16:45:40 <rbasak> Daviey: no, we made the decision not to do that

 16:46:23 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Open Discussion

 16:46:24 <rbasak> Daviey: so all rdepends remain linked against openmpi

 16:46:37 <rbasak> I think going over http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html should be split into a separate topic. It tends to take the bulk of the meeting so it would make sense to have it separated so that other things associated with the release timetable (FFes etc) can be covered without forgetting anything.

 16:47:37 <roaksoax> does someone agree/disagree? Daviey ^^?

 16:48:19 <arosales> seems it should at least be a subtopic under precise/current development

 16:48:41 <arosales> along with that it would be nice to have a sub-topic for essential or near milestone blueprints

 16:48:42 <roaksoax> I'd say so too

 16:48:52 <SpamapS> roaksoax: you skipped my section

 16:49:15 <SpamapS> Zentyal Packages (http://pad.lv/928501) - SpamapS

 16:49:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 928501 in ebox (Ubuntu) "Precise will ship totally broken ebox packages" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:49:28 <roaksoax> [action] add subtopics for release-bugs/BP;s under precise/current development

 16:49:28 * meetingology add subtopics for release-bugs/BP;s under precise/current development

 16:49:44 <roaksoax> SpamapS: sorry about that, was going over the pastable commands

 16:49:49 <roaksoax> [topic] Zentyal Packages (http://pad.lv/928501) - SpamapS

 16:49:57 <SpamapS> So anyway, this item has been at the top of the sponsorship queue for a few weeks now

 16:50:02 <SpamapS> We need to break it up

 16:50:24 <SpamapS> We should all have patch pilot days coming up..

 16:50:25 <Daviey> SpamapS: they still need multiple src packages?

 16:50:32 <SpamapS> Daviey: aye

 16:50:56 <SpamapS> We need to review them, one by one, until they're done.

 16:51:03 <Daviey> *awesome*

 16:51:10 <Daviey> SpamapS: How many are there?

 16:51:14 <SpamapS> if they miss NEW for precise, so be it, but Zentyal has been good to us, and we need to do what we can to help get their stuff into Ubuntu

 16:51:18 <SpamapS> Daviey: 13 I think

 16:51:37 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/~jacalvo/+archive/zentyal-precise/

 16:51:38 <Daviey> SpamapS: perfect, fancy assigning one to each member of the team?

 16:51:42 <SpamapS> 16

 16:52:21 <SpamapS> Daviey: I'd like to allow people to assign them to themselves..

 16:52:35 <SpamapS> Daviey: since some may feel more comfortable with ntp, openvpn, or squid, than others

 16:52:35 <jamespage> SpamapS, I'll pickup a few

 16:52:42 <Daviey> SpamapS: lets just progress it, it's easier to have someone co-ordinate it

 16:52:58 <SpamapS> So yeah, please focus your sponsorship efforts on that bug, and make it clear what you are going to review, so others don't duplicate the work.

 16:53:06 <Daviey> SpamapS: Really, anyone should be able to turn their hand to any of the technologies it uses.

 16:53:19 <Daviey> If they can't, we have problems. :)

 16:53:31 <SpamapS> indeed

 16:54:02 <SpamapS> We'll check back in on the progress next week.

 16:54:09 <SpamapS> that is all, thanks!

 16:54:24 <roaksoax> awesome then!

 16:54:31 <roaksoax> [topic] Announce next meeting date and time

 16:55:10 <roaksoax> for US timezones. Which means that meeting for us will be one more hour

 16:55:55 <roaksoax> ok so we can keep the same UTC time

 16:55:57 <Daviey> So nothing changes for admin.

 16:56:08 <roaksoax> agreed then. SpamapS So you won't be chairing next week either?
