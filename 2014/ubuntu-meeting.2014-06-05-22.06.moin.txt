 22:06 <s-fox> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for June 5, 2014.

 22:07 <s-fox> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:07 <s-fox> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:07 <s-fox> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:07 <s-fox> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:07 <s-fox> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:07 <s-fox> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:07 <s-fox> Alright, first up is spineau. Please introduce yourself :)

 22:07 <spineau> Hello, I'm Sylvain Pineau (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SylvainPineau). I live in France. I'm a perl/python developer and Ubuntu addict since 2006

 22:07 <spineau> My contributions to the Ubuntu Community:

 22:08 <spineau> I'm one of the main developers of CheckBox (the System Testing application of Ubuntu)

 22:08 <spineau> I wrote several tests that have been used by the Ubuntu Friendly community project (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFriendly)

 22:08 <spineau> I led a session during vUDS 1311 detailing the plan to use a new core (http://plainbox.readthedocs.org) and a new UI built using the Ubuntu SDK (QML) for 14.04

 22:08 <spineau> I also contributed to various test frameworks over the past years (Mago, Xpresser) to enhance the overall quality of Ubuntu releases

 22:08 <spineau> I'm a 10k+ user on Ask Ubuntu (http://askubuntu.com/users/32239/sylvain-pineau) where I (amongst other things) try to help people creating Ubuntu Touch applications using the SDK

 22:08 <spineau> I'm (so far :)) the top answerer in both QML and ubuntu-sdk tags (see http://askubuntu.com/tags/qml/topusers and http://askubuntu.com/tags/ubuntu-sdk/topusers)

 22:08 <spineau> 4 Ubuntu members left their testimonials (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SylvainPineau#Testimonials) but are not able to join us (different timezones, it's midnight here in CEST)
