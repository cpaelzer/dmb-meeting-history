 16:14 <jamespage> arosales, leave it with me - I'll find one

 16:15 <arosales> thanks jamespage

 16:15 <jamespage> zul, pls can we get a trove upload into utopic to fix up that bug above

 16:15 <arosales> lol serue

 16:15 <zul> jamespage: yes

 16:15 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:15 <jamespage> zul, (plus we probably need a FFe bug so we can annoy the release team officially)

 16:15 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-u/group/topic-u-server.html

 16:16 <arosales> currently in red status 48% of 191

 16:16 <arosales> lets at least hit the essentials

 16:16 <arosales> and any other BPs folks want to take a look at

 16:16 <arosales> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-u-lxc

 16:16 <caribou> arosales: I will update mine (kdump) as it will not make it to Utopic

 16:17 <arosales> caribou: thanks

 16:17 <arosales> hallyn around?

 16:17 * lutostag needs to update his blueprint too...

 16:17 * arosales doesn't seem him

 16:17 <serue> \o

 16:17 <arosales> or serue thats you :-)

 16:17 <arosales> any comments on lxc BP?

 16:17 <serue> questions on lxc bp?

 16:18 <arosales> currently in red and marked essential, on track for utopic release?

 16:18 <serue> sadly i don't believe the apparmor stuff wil lhappen this cycle

 16:18 <serue> unless jjohansen has updated info

 16:19 <arosales> ok, may be to a point where BP updates need "postponed" if that is not going to happen

 16:19 <serue> overall i think the bp is in pretty good shape.  (it's a little overextended, as it includes c/r)

 16:19 <gnuoy> apologies I need to run

 16:19 <arosales> understood, thanks for the update.  Suggest to sync on aparmor and postpone if it is realisticaly not going to happen

 16:19 <serue> heh, tycho didn't mark some thingsk done :)

 16:19 <arosales> #linkd https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-u-openstack-charms

 16:19 <serue> selling himself short

 16:20 <arosales> serue: so should be in a better state than what it shows

 16:20 <arosales> jamespage: looks like you are the owner here

 16:20 <arosales> on track for release?

 16:20 <jamespage> arosales, yeah

 16:20 <arosales> cool, thanks

 16:20 <arosales> jamespage: and BP has current status?

 16:21 <jamespage> I have a few bits stacked up in testing which will mark alot of that DONE

 16:21 <arosales> cool

 16:21 <arosales> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-u-openstack-juno

 16:21 <jamespage> it is

 16:21 <arosales> zul: on track for release and BP up to date ?

 16:21 <arosales> jamespage thanks

 16:21 <zul> arges:  yes

 16:21 <zul> ill update it this week

 16:22 <arosales> zul ok thanks (/me assumes that is for me)

 16:22 * arges is used to it

 16:22 <arosales> those are the 3 essential BPs

 16:22 <arosales> any others folks want to cover?

 16:22 <arosales> a lot of red there so per the action please update BPs as final beta is around the corner

 16:23 <arosales> doesn't see any other requests to review BPs . . .

 16:23 <arosales> next topic

 16:23 <arosales> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:23 <caribou> Nothing outstanding aside from the fact that I now have PPU rights for sosreport & makedumpfile

 16:23 <caribou> sosreport being seeded on the server image

 16:23 <arosales> congrats on PPU :-)

 16:24 <arosales> seems like that would be handy

 16:24 <arosales> thanks for the update caribou

 16:24 <jdstrand> no, apparmor lxc stuff will not land this cycle

 16:24 <arosales> jdstrand: thanks for the info

 16:24 <serue> jdstrand: :(  thx

 16:24 <arosales> serue ^ could you update the BP accordingly please

 16:24 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:25 <serue> arosales: pessimistically i already had

 16:25 <arosales> serue: thanks and it good for folks to see in case they had any objections or new info.

 16:25 <jdstrand> jjohansen got quite a bit done, but we actually didn't commit to 14.10-- we said (when planning this cycle) we'd try for 14.10 but want to deliever for 15.04

 16:25 <serue> jdstrand: not judging :)

 16:25 <jdstrand> we need to review the feasibility of that now-- but considerable progress has been made
