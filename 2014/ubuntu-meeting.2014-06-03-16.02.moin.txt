 16:05 <coreycb> Ok thanks.  So mark your calendars!

 16:06 <gaughen> I'm still working on topics, so if someone has a suggestion for something fabulous - I'm all ears!

 16:06 <coreycb> Does anyone have anything else to metion regarding vUDS?

 16:06 <beisner> is that the virtual Unicorn Developer Summit?

 16:07 <coreycb> lol, sounds close enough

 16:07 <coreycb> alright, moving on

 16:07 <gaughen> beisner, GENIUS!

 16:07 <coreycb> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-u-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:07 <beisner> that was for you, gaughen

 16:07 <coreycb> let me try that again

 16:07 <coreycb> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:08 <coreycb> topic is not changing

 16:08 <coreycb> I think we're good

 16:09 <coreycb> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-u-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:09 <coreycb> bug 1319555

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1319555 in ec2-api-tools (Ubuntu Utopic) "update out-dated ec2-api-tools for 12.04" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1319555

 16:10 <coreycb> That bug is fix released for utopic.  It looks like Precise and trusty are still in the works?

 16:10 <gaughen> hrmm, utlemming isn't in the meeting

 16:11 <coreycb> smoser, maybe you know

 16:11 <smoser> checking. i think its fixed.

 16:11 <smoser> or they said not important.

 16:11 <smoser> yeah, he marked it invalid

 16:11 <smoser> why would it still be on a list ?

 16:12 <smoser> odd.

 16:12 <smoser> that list seems out of date then.

 16:12 <coreycb> ah yes it says invalid for precise and trusty

 16:12 <coreycb> #action refresh bug list

 16:12 * meetingology refresh bug list

 16:12 <gaughen> ooh I've never done an action, coreycb

 16:12 <gaughen> you are fancy

 16:12 <coreycb> I'm pretty fancy

 16:13 <coreycb> bug 1315052

 16:13 <ubottu> bug 1315052 in lxc (Ubuntu Trusty) "lxc-attach from a different login session fails" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1315052

 16:13 * rharper copies coreycb as QOTD

 16:13 <coreycb> hallyn_, anything new there?  Looks to be fixed everywhere but trusty.

 16:13 <smoser> coreycb and his hashtags.

 16:13 <hallyn_> i think that may actually be fixed, but not sure

 16:14 <hallyn_> fix committed upstream anyway

 16:14 <coreycb> hallyn_, Sounds good

 16:15 <coreycb> and last but not least

 16:15 <coreycb> bug 1317587

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1317587 in clamav (Ubuntu Utopic) "ClamAV 0.98.1 is Outdated" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1317587

 16:15 <coreycb> That's in progress.  Do we need to follow up with Scott Kitterman on that?

 16:16 <coreycb> gaughen, jamespage, smoser, anyone?

 16:17 * coreycb insert Ferris Bueller quote

 16:17 * gaughen avoids eye contact

 16:17 <rharper> those are nice shoes

 16:17 <coreycb> ok moving on

 16:17 <coreycb> heh

 16:17 <coreycb> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:18 <gaughen> :-)

 16:18 <coreycb> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-u/group/topic-u-server.html

 16:18 <coreycb> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-u-server

 16:18 <coreycb> We're making progress on some of these

 16:18 <gaughen> coreycb, the team is working on getting the blueprints filled out completley

 16:18 <gaughen> I'm expecting we'll get them solidified around vUDS

 16:19 <coreycb> gaughen, Great, sounds good

 16:19 <gaughen> overall, I'm very pleased with where we are in the cycle blueprint wise - YEAH TEAM!!!!!!

 16:20 <coreycb> great, moving on

 16:20 <coreycb> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:20 <caribou> well, follow-up on blueprint topic

 16:20 <caribou> I created this one : https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-u-networked-kdump

 16:20 <gaughen> caribou, ah, I should link that in... although it's rather blank ;-)

 16:21 <caribou> pls confirm that it is no longer required

 16:21 <caribou> as I'm doing the work on debian first

 16:21 <caribou> so it will be merged in from debian

 16:21 <caribou> so no need for a blueprint then, right ?

 16:22 <caribou> aside from that, I'm good, nothing else to bring up coreycb

 16:22 <coreycb> I'm not sure.  Maybe jamespage or smoser knows.

 16:22 <gaughen> caribou, I would say we'd want one if there is anything we need to make sure to do in the release

 16:22 <smoser> reading

 16:23 <smoser> caribou, theres never actually any *need* for a blueprint :)

 16:23 <smoser> it wouldnt hurt to have a blueprint, it cna still trak items that are done in debian.

 16:23 <smoser> [caribou] get stuff into debian

 16:23 <smoser> [caribou] make sure stuff works in ubuntu

 16:23 <smoser> ...

 16:23 <caribou> smoser: ok, will do that & get it approved

 16:23 <smoser> obviously better tasks than that are allowed :)

 16:24 <coreycb> ok thanks

 16:24 <coreycb> next topic

 16:24 <coreycb> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:24 <coreycb> It looks like psivaa is not around

 16:25 <coreycb> next topic

 16:25 <coreycb> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:25 <smb> Hi there. And sorry not really much to say.

 16:26 <coreycb> Ok smb, thanks for the update :)

 16:26 <coreycb> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:26 <coreycb> well, as we mentioned earlier vUDS is next week.  Anything else going on?

 16:26 <gaughen> caribou, do we want to discuss kdump at vuds?

 16:27 <caribou> gaughen: sure we could schedule something

 16:27 <caribou> gaughen: if there is any interest

 16:27 <gaughen> caribou, my goal would be to have the blueprint all sorted by the end of next week.

 16:27 <gaughen> and if we need a vUDS session to help do that, so be it

 16:28 <gaughen> coreycb, there's an Openstack meetup in London on Thursday.

 16:28 <gaughen> it's open to the community. gnuoy and jamespage are going

 16:28 <gaughen> that is all I can think of
