 16:02 <zul> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <jamespage> o/

 16:03 <arosales> o/

 16:03 <zul> it says gaughen to raise sessions of vuds

 16:03 <zul> since vuds is next week

 16:03 <zul> i guess that isnt done yet since  I havent seen it, so im going to punt it til the next meeting

 16:03 <zul> #topic T Development

 16:03 <zul> jamespage:  do you want to take this?

 16:04 <jamespage> zul, uh - OK

 16:04 <jamespage> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule

 16:04 <jamespage> so

 16:05 <jamespage> server is particpating in final beta on the 27th

 16:05 <jamespage> so primary focus should be on bug fixing

 16:05 <jamespage> we have lots - go have a dig :-)

 16:05 <jamespage> what FFe's have we got inflight?

 16:06 <jamespage> I'm aware of incomplete ones for juju-core (1.18) and ceph firefly release

 16:06 <jamespage> smoser, maas?

 16:06 <jamespage> I was also asked to consider whether mongodb 2.6.0 might make release but its very tight and not top of my list

 16:06 <zul> openstack ones have to be filed, libvirt-1.2.2 have to been filed

 16:06 <jamespage> zul, for a point release update?

 16:06 <zul> jamespage:  yes

 16:06 <jamespage> zul, OK _ file the OpenStack ones - but that should be a formality in my opinion

 16:07 <jamespage> we're not going to not ship icehouse

 16:07 <zul> jamespage:  agreeed

 16:07 <zul> libvirt as well

 16:07 <serue> qemu 2.0 granted...

 16:07 <jamespage> can folks ensure that a trusty task is raised - that way they should appear on the release bugs reports

 16:07 <jamespage> serue, w00t!

 16:08 <jamespage> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:08 <jamespage> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:09 <zul> i thought the django-compressor stuff was done

 16:10 <zul> anything else?

 16:10 <jamespage> zul: bug 1259166

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1259166 in horizon (Ubuntu Trusty) "Fix lintian error" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1259166

 16:10 <zul> yeah i know :(

 16:10 <zul> ill see if i can get it fixed today

 16:10 <jamespage> re django compressor

 16:10 <jamespage> bug 1252627

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1252627 in python-django-compressor (Ubuntu Trusty) "[MIR] build dependencies for python-django-compressor" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1252627

 16:10 <jamespage> I believe that still needs the bs4 transition doing

 16:10 <zul> im pretty sure i did that...ill double check

 16:11 <jamespage> zul, ta

 16:11 <jamespage> bug 1278897 still needs me to fix

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1278897 in dovecot (Ubuntu Trusty) "dovecot warns about moved ssl certs on upgrade" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1278897

 16:11 <jamespage> I'll do that this week

 16:12 <zul> ill take a look at swift

 16:12 <jamespage> zul, only the start/stop highlevel upstart config todo there

 16:12 <jamespage> not worried about the rest

 16:13 <zul> ok

 16:13 <jamespage> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:13 <zul> anything else

 16:13 <jamespage> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:13 <jamespage> just going to throw it out - anything got anything they want to raise about BP's?

 16:13 <jamespage> I don't

 16:14 <jamespage> we're backloaded on charms

 16:14 <jamespage> and I think everything else is actually OK despite the red

 16:14 <jamespage> zul, ok all yours

 16:14 <zul> okies

 16:15 <zul> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:15 <zul> hi caribou around?

 16:16 <zul> any questions from psivaa?

 16:16 <psivaa> zul: nope

 16:16 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:16 <smb> I wasn't quick enough in the previous sections but I am trying to get a FFE done for Xen-4.4. Currently working to get a rc6 based packaging done for early testing. Upstream release should be relatively soon (though they said that with rc5).

 16:16 <zul> hi smb i know you are here

 16:17 <zul> smb: cool!

 16:17 <sforshee> no updates here

 16:17 <smb> Otherwise nested vmx looks to be working again for T.

 16:17 <smb> qemu that is

 16:17 <zul> yay!

 16:17 <zul> any questions for sforshee or smb?

 16:18 <zul> if not

 16:18 <zul> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:18 <zul> hi rbasak

 16:18 <zul> any updates?

 16:19 <zul> i guess he is not here either

 16:19 <zul> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:19 <zul> so vuds is next week

 16:19 <zul> i think we are going to have a couple of topics that we are gonig to discuss, the schedule should out soon

 16:19 <zul> any other events?

 16:20 <zul> so since everyone is asleep

 16:21 <zul> #topic Open Discussion

 16:21 <jamespage> zul, yes - indeed

 16:21 <zul> anythin else to discuss

 16:21 <zul> i think we should skip next week's meeting since vuds is happening

 16:22 <zul> anyone have a problem with that?

 16:23 <serue> nope

 16:23 <zul> i guess not...

 16:23 <zul> see you in two weeks
