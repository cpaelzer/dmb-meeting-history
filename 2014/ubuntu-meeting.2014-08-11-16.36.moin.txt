 16:37 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'll go first

 16:37 * ScottK waves

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I have some updates to test and publish, including a bunch of openstack on trusty updates

 16:38 <mdeslaur> and am looking to go down the list as much as possible before I go on vacation next week

 16:38 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it from me...sbeattie, you're up

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor this week

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'm currently trying to wade through my email after being on holiday last week

 16:39 * jjohansen cheers and hands sbeattie the backend parser change work

 16:40 <sbeattie> I need to sync up with jjohansen on where things stand with abstract sockets and apparmor.

 16:40 <sbeattie> Heh, pretty much my plan is to dig into whatever you need help with, jjohansen.

 16:40 <sbeattie> That's pretty much it for me. tyhicks?

 16:41 <tyhicks> I'll be working on apparmor this week

 16:41 <tyhicks> my main focus will be to land the abstract socket mediation changes when they're ready

 16:42 <tyhicks> I just finished building the latest kernel changes for utopic-amd64, goldfish-i386, and mako-armhf

 16:42 <tyhicks> now I'll start making system policy changes

 16:43 <tyhicks> while those kernels were building, I started modifying the unix_socket_file.sh regression test to add the ability to test abstract sockets

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'll wrap that up and send it out sometime this week

 16:43 <tyhicks> I also need to try to refresh the dbus merge (LP: #1320422)

 16:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1320422 in dbus (Ubuntu) "Please merge dbus 1.8.2-1 (main) from Debian testing (main)" [Low,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1320422

 16:43 <tyhicks> and I need to prep for LSS next week

 16:43 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:43 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: hello?

 16:45 <jjohansen> I'm primarily working on landing the abstract socket mediation this week. I'll need to sync up with sbeattie and continue to fix the backend of the policy compiler

 16:45 <jjohansen> hey mdeslaur

 16:45 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: what's the status, is everything going along as you'd like?

 16:46 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: not really, I figured out a large part of the issue was backend compiler work that I hadn't been planning on yet

 16:47 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: so we are doing the shortest path update to that we can

 16:47 <mdeslaur> ok

 16:47 <mdeslaur> thanks

 16:48 <jjohansen> I think that is it from me, sarnold you're up

 16:48 <sarnold> I'm on triage this week; I've also got two MIRs, one already in flight but repeated pre-empted, the other not yet started

 16:50 <sarnold> I'll review whatever patches john can come up with this week, too, and I am hoping that the filemanager PAM integration v2 might be ready for a review this week. (Though that's optimism on my part.)

 16:50 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> I'm continuing to work through my RTM bugs this week (and I've potentially got one extra now - bug 1353453)

 16:51 <ubottu> bug 1353453 in webbrowser-app "m.here.com doesnâ€™t close authentication page after logging in" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1353453

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> I've done the most important code reviews for oxide, although I've still got some left - those aren't seriously urgent

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> and I've got one update to do this week too

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> that's me done :)

 16:52 <mdeslaur> anyone left?

 16:52 <mdeslaur> guess not

 16:53 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
