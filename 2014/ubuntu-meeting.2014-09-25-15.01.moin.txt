 15:07 <sil2100> Did I miss my turn?

 15:07 <cjwatson> sil2100: nope, you're after barry

 15:11 <sil2100> o/

 15:11 <slangasek> so now that bhuey has read policy, the rest of our meeting today can be to quiz him on it ;)

 15:11 <sil2100> - Filling in the standing FFe for utopic Ubuntu Touch packages (LP: #1371635)

 15:11 <sil2100> - Refactoring some of the commit-log syncing scripts

 15:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1371635 in Ubuntu "[FFe] standing freeze exception in utopic for Ubuntu Touch-specific packages" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1371635

 15:11 <sil2100> - Landing team work, preparing landing e-mails

 15:11 <bhuey> slangasek: shit

 15:11 <sil2100> - CI Train maintenance and feature:

 15:11 <sil2100> * Testing binary copy sync functionality

 15:11 <sil2100> * Improve error verbosity in some cases for sync rebuilds

 15:11 <sil2100> * Cleaning up left-over jenkins jobs

 15:11 <sil2100> * Refactoring parts of the build job to enable better testing

 15:11 <sil2100> * Add basic unit tests for the sync functionality

 15:11 <sil2100> * Make the ~rtm addition to the version number optional

 15:11 <sil2100> * Fixing a new small bug that caused the spreadsheet to malfunction

 15:11 <sil2100> - Reviewing and testing bugfixing merge for appmenu-qt5

 15:12 <sil2100> - Fixing/unbricking testing device

 15:12 <sil2100> - Writing announcement e-mails

 15:12 <sil2100> - Making sure the documentation of RTM landings is up-to-date

 15:12 <sil2100> - Debugging issues with commit-log generation scripts

 15:12 <sil2100> - Discussions regarding getting rid of the spreadsheet (finally!)

 15:12 <sil2100> (done)

 15:12 <robru> ok, i'm ready now, can i go?

 15:12 <slangasek> robru: sure

 15:13 <robru> Train:

 15:13 <robru> - Adapted 'citrain' (silo installation script) to work on RTM

 15:13 <robru> - Updated citrain spreadsheet, jenkins backend, and dashboard to recognize the 10 new silos

 15:13 <robru> - Began test-drive reimplementation of cupstream2distro/silomanager.py, with the intention to fix the utter disgusting lack of encapsulation, such that other bits of citrain no longer need to have knowledge of the custom json format used to maintain each silo's state (this will make it easier/possible to back citrain onto the airline ticket system when the

 15:13 <robru> time comes)

 15:13 <robru> - Fixed the deploy job to correctly assign pre-prod silos, making it possible to test things outside of production

 15:13 <robru> - Stopped the prepare job from being able to delete packages from the PPA, which it was often doing erroneously and deleting packages that had been through hours of scarce QA approval

 15:13 <robru> - Implemented a generic signal / unhandled exception handler, which is capable of a) logging and b) saving the signal/exception message to the silo status, such that the dashboard can now report when a job exits uncleanly, so we no longer have the situation where the dashboard reports 'Building...' even if something has actually gone horribly wrong

 15:13 <robru> - Cleaned up the use of subprocess module, so that the testsuite no longer spews random crap on STDOUT, making it a lot easier to see a clean, successful test run

 15:13 <robru> NFSS:

 15:13 <robru> - Added veebers' new js module to lp:ubuntu-assets and got it approved by oatman

 15:13 <robru> (done)

 15:13 <slangasek> sil2100: FFe> did everything work out wrt touch packages in the auto-accept list?

 15:13 <infinity> bhuey: A binary package leaves my dput travelling three versions per epoch, when is it appropriate to use Conflicts versus Breaks, and does the answer change when drunk?

 15:13 <sil2100> slangasek: I think it did, since we didn't see any further problems

 15:13 <barry> infinity: binNMU

 15:14 <cjwatson> infinity: consider a spherical manual page

 15:14 <infinity> cjwatson: I actually ell oh elled.

 15:14 <infinity> cjwatson: And, for some reason, I read that in Bill Bailey's voice.

 15:16 <slangasek> * business meeting up in Seattle yesterday, the jet lag is horrible

 15:16 <slangasek> * review of a number of impending partner packages

 15:16 <slangasek> * working to move a number click apps out of the rootfs into a default "custom" tarball (bug #1367332)

 15:16 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 1367332 could not be found

 15:16 <slangasek> * progress on a console-setup merge with Colin's help; the package may be uploadable this year

 15:16 <slangasek> * created new silos at LT's request

 15:16 <slangasek> * LT/CI meetings to discuss next steps on CI Airline (e.g., ditching the spreadsheet)

 15:16 <slangasek> (done)

 15:16 <bhuey> infinity: yes, only when also taking opiates with alcohol

 15:16 <jodh> * upstart:

 15:16 <jodh> - investigating bug 1371651.

 15:17 <jodh> * system-image

 15:17 <jodh> - Good progress - root is now r/o with a writeable overlay.

 15:17 <slangasek> if a ~ falls in the middle of your version, does it make a sound

 15:17 <jodh> - More tweaks to lp:~ubuntu-foundations-team/+junk/create-ubuntu-core-image.

 15:17 <jodh> - Split lp:~ubuntu-foundations-team/+junk/system-image-rootfs into 2:

 15:17 <jodh> - lp:~ubuntu-foundations-team/+junk/ubuntu-core-config [1]

 15:17 <jodh> - lp:~ubuntu-foundations-team/+junk/initramfs-tools-ubuntu-core [2]

 15:17 <jodh> - Currently testing recent changes to [2].

 15:17 <jodh> * misc:

 15:17 <jodh> - procenv is now running for lucid as well as all newer supported releases:

 15:17 <jodh> â­ˆ

 15:18 <slangasek> jodh: bug #1371651> do we know what /changed/ to cause this problem?

 15:18 <ubottu> bug 1371651 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "Daily does not boot into graphical interface after installation" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1371651

 15:18 <slangasek> (it was the kernel, wasn't it!)

 15:19 <jodh> slangasek: no - I've asked jibel to check packages differences, but I don't think it's upstart.

 15:19 <slangasek> I agree

 15:19 <infinity> slangasek: No one seems entirely sure who to blame just yet, though the kernel seems a likely candidate.

 15:19 <slangasek> plymouth has been uploaded recently (twice in the past 8 days), but those changes should also not have had an effect

 15:20 <infinity> (Or, the whole process is just amazingly fragile, and the fault lies in all the players together, plus it was Wednesday)

 15:20 <jodh> well as I noted on the bug, we do see plymouth crashing in the logs but that might be due to fb issues which are also causing the failure of upstart to emit the plymouth-ready event.

 15:20 <slangasek> right, in which case --> kernel

 15:21 <jodh> slangasek: right, jibel is trying to track down apw I believe.

 15:21 <slangasek> has anyone asked apw about it?

 15:21 <slangasek> ok :)

 15:21 <infinity> The part where "it works with systemd" (while also obviously not being directly an upstart bug) kinda points to the fragility argument.

 15:22 <jibel> slangasek, apw is working on it

 15:22 <jodh> infinity: but has anyone tried uselessd yet? :)

 15:22 <slangasek> infinity: on systemd we don't have any flicker-free boot integration

 15:23 <apw> the state the machine ends up in when this is reproduced seems to indicate everything is in order, and running service lightdm start sorts it out (i believe)

 15:23 <apw> w

 15:23 <apw> which leans towards a userspace race in my eyes, but i am waiting on some installs

 15:24 <slangasek> apw: if the plymouth-ready signal isn't being emitted because of a kernel-induced plymouth crash, that's not really a matter of a race

 15:24 <slangasek> anyway, seems like this is in hand so we can discuss it on better channels post-meeting

 15:24 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:24 <slangasek> anything else today?

 15:24 <slangasek> I've been failing to tag people to do the weekly talk-about-what-you're-working-on thing

 15:25 <slangasek> does somebody want to volunteer to do one next week?

 15:25 <jodh> apw: fwics, if you remove "quiet splash", the problem is not recreatable but would value other trying it (I've asked a few times on the bug :-)

 15:25 <bdmurray> cjwatson: regarding bug 1372673, it looks like you found most of the duplicates. Did you check other packages though?

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1372673 in man-db (Ubuntu Trusty) "excessive debconf use when triggered" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1372673

 15:26 <cjwatson> bdmurray: nope, I don't have a mechanical search for it and some of the problems are subtly different

 15:26 <cjwatson> so I had only finite time

 15:27 <cjwatson> bdmurray: I'm certain I found all the duplicates on man-db - the others that look similar are actually cropping up in postinst configure instead which is different

 15:27 <slangasek> no volunteers? :)

 15:27 <cjwatson> you have to hunt for debconf failures immediately following "Processing triggers for man-db" or translations thereof

 15:27 <slangasek> you don't have to prepare anything... (in fact it's better if you don't!...) you just have to talk about what you're working on

 15:28 <robru> slangasek: i volunteer for the week of the washington sprint so this meeting won't be so painfully early for me ;-)

 15:28 <bdmurray> cjwatson: okay, I may have a look around and then check with you

 15:28 <cjwatson> ok sure

 15:28 <slangasek> robru: invest in coffee

 15:28 <robru> slangasek: just say NO to drugs ;-)

 15:28 <cjwatson> our coffee machine wasn't working this morning /o\

 15:29 <slangasek> robru: you can balance it out with bhuey's opiate-laced alcohol

 15:29 * ogra_ listens up

 15:29 <bdmurray> I've moved away from machines to an aeropress now.

 15:29 <cjwatson> slangasek: guess I can if everyone else is running away; it's been a while for me

 15:29 <cjwatson> (next week)

 15:29 <slangasek> cjwatson: thanks :)

 15:30 * meetingology cjwatson to do a what-I'm-working-on presentation next week

 15:30 <slangasek> bdmurray: this is only impressive if you also have a button to deliver the prepared cup of coffee to your desk via pneumatic tube

 15:31 <cjwatson> slangasek: have you seen Wallace and Gromit or is that too much of a British thing?

 15:31 <slangasek> cjwatson: yes, quite familiar with it :)

 15:31 <slangasek> (the last movie even had a theatrical release in the US!)

 15:32 <slangasek> er, I think

 15:32 <slangasek> oh right, Chicken Run was technically not W&G, just Aardman

 15:32 <bdmurray> I agree with your thought

 15:32 <slangasek> anyway, speaking of which
