 16:05 <cjwatson> GRUB:

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Applied bi-endian ELF parser patch.

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Tidied up a few packaging bugs introduced when merging 2.02~beta2.

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Organised some real-world testing of 2.02~beta2 (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2014-01-18-testing-wanted-grub-2.02-beta2.html); fixed a few bugs that resulted.  There's still the odd problem, but I think it should be good to go into trusty tomorrow or Monday.

 16:05 <cjwatson> Click:

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Added ${short-id} hook pattern expansion (bug 1251635).

 16:05 <ubottu> bug 1251635 in upstart-app-launch (Ubuntu) "drop version numbers from users' .desktop file names" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1251635

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Stripped trailing slashes from hook patterns (bug 1253855).

 16:05 <ubottu> bug 1253855 in click (Ubuntu) "strip any trailing slash from hook Pattern entry" [Low,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1253855

 16:05 <cjwatson> - Added support for apps requiring multiple frameworks.

 16:06 <cjwatson> 12.04.4:

 16:06 <cjwatson> - More chasing of various SRUs.

 16:06 <cjwatson> - Uploaded d-i for other series so that I can fully QA a kickseed SRU.

 16:06 <cjwatson> Miscellaneous:

 16:06 <cjwatson> - Some work on the libwebp transition.

 16:06 <cjwatson> - Merged partman-auto.

 16:06 <cjwatson> - Minimal proof of concept of autopilot/emulator tests driven by autopkgtest, based on xnox's work.

 16:06 <cjwatson> - Organised a launchpad-buildd upgrade (now with IS), including the slave side of livefs-in-LP.

 16:06 <cjwatson> ..

 16:06 <cjwatson> xnox: I'll review partman-crypto today; somebody else should review ubiquity since I have a change in there

 16:06 <xnox> cjwatson: thanks.

 16:07 <cjwatson> though I don't see ubiquity in the precise-proposed queue

 16:07 <xnox> hm. checking.

 16:07 <stgraber> cjwatson: I can take ubiquity once it's in the queue

 16:07 <cjwatson> ta

 16:07 <slangasek> * short week, bank holiday on Monday

 16:07 <slangasek> * working with the emulator locally to test pam 1.1.8 before upload

 16:07 <slangasek> * going down a rabbit hole wrt autopilot tests and upstart jobs on the phone

 16:07 <slangasek> * looking at what's required for Java support in 14.04

 16:08 <slangasek> * ongoing discussions in Debian about init systems for jessie

 16:08 <slangasek> * prepared slides/video summary of Foundations client-side roadmap in 14.04, which will be posted publically for the community on youtube soonish (tomorrow?)

 16:08 <slangasek> * taking tomorrow off - see you in London :)

 16:08 <slangasek> (done)

 16:08 <jodh> * core-1311-upstart-roadmap:

 16:08 <jodh> - cgroup support: Updated code for cgmanager 0.16.

 16:08 <jodh> - async spawning: Ongoing work to resolve script job bug.

 16:08 <jodh> * upstart:

 16:08 <jodh> - bug 1269731: Fixed and wrote new tests. Landed upstream and uploaded as

 16:08 <ubottu> bug 1269731 in upstart "init crashed with SIGSEGV" [Critical,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1269731

 16:08 <jodh> upstart 1.11-0ubuntu2.

 16:08 <jodh> - DEP-8 tests: Attempted a nested kvm setup using canonistack as bug

 16:08 <jodh> 1208509 may now be fixed in trusty we believe. However, since the

 16:08 <jodh> latest images are a week old, they suffer from bug 1269731 (meaning

 16:08 <jodh> the guest dies when the packages are automatically updated before

 16:08 <jodh> the tests are run. I'll wait until there is a new image containing

 16:08 <jodh> upstart 1.11-0ubuntu2 then try again.

 16:08 <jodh> - Wrote a periodic-logrotate job that could be useful until Upstart

 16:08 <jodh> grows a time bridge (since currently we only run logrotate once) and

 16:08 <jodh> raised an MP for discussion:

 16:08 <jodh> https://code.launchpad.net/~jamesodhunt/ubuntu/trusty/upstart/periodic-logrotate/+merge/202434

 16:08 <jodh> - Fixed Upstart element of bug 1263738 such that Upstart will not own

 16:08 <ubottu> bug 1263738 in lxc (Ubuntu Trusty) "login console 0 in user namespace container is not configured right" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1263738

 16:08 <slangasek> xnox: when did you fix the cmake cross-compilation regression?  Does that fix the problem ChickenCutlass was seeing yesterday with powerd?

 16:08 <jodh> the console, even in an lxc container (where /dev/kmsg is linked to /dev/console).

 16:09 <jodh> https://code.launchpad.net/~jamesodhunt/upstart/kmsg-noctty/+merge/202673

 16:09 <jodh> (Thanks to stgraber for reviewing and additional testing!)

 16:09 <jodh> ☋

 16:09 <stokachu> kermit?

 16:09 <xnox> slangasek: i fixed it couple of hours ago. Let me test powerd quickly.

 16:09 <slangasek> xnox: oh, I used abi-compliance-checker on qt5 this past week (hmm, shoulda put that in the status report) - nice little tool, though for Qt5.0->Qt5.2 the reports are oppressively verbose :)

 16:10 <doko> - working today together with the Berlin locals in an office

 16:10 <doko> - Mon, Tue another two days of merges, nbs, component mismatches, MIR's

 16:10 <doko> - look at (and fix) libffi / python-cffi issues on armhf, arm64 (with Will Newton)

 16:10 <doko> - GCC 4.9 updates, GCC 4.8 updates

 16:10 <doko> - gccgo merges and backports

 16:10 <doko> - main test rebuild evaluation

 16:10 <doko> - ppc64el fixes

 16:10 <doko> - build the mono stack for ppc64el

 16:10 <doko> (done)

 16:10 <xnox> slangasek: i think, all we want is to construct a chroot / phone-image with 5.2 stack, take system dump of that chroot, and then simply run abi-compliance-checker against binary / library and ask it to say if it's compatible with this new system-dump or not.

 16:11 <stokachu> bug 833994 is coming up again, seems the users just want https and do not care about verification

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 833994 in debian-installer-utils (Ubuntu) "debian-installer does not support https when using with preseed files" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/833994

 16:11 <stokachu> (done)

 16:11 <xnox> slangasek: i think that's easier, rather than tracking all internal exposed details of qt 5.0 -> 5.2 changes.

 16:11 <stgraber> - cgmanager:

 16:11 <stgraber> - Did a few pre-upload package reviews

 16:11 <stgraber> - NEWed the package into the archive

 16:11 <stgraber> - LXC:

 16:11 <stgraber> - Fixed PAM harder to make it work with unprivileged containers.

 16:11 <stgraber> - Wrote about unprivileged LXC: https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/17/lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers/

 16:11 <stgraber> - Worked pretty hard to get unprivileged LXC to be as close to privileged LXC feature-wise (got lxc-attach working, fixed a ton of small bugs here and there).

 16:12 <stgraber> - A ton of code reviews (got all outstanding pull requests handled, same with all patches sent to various lists), started to go through outstanding bugs.

 16:12 <stgraber> - Ubuntu touch

 16:12 <stgraber> - Some more work on the system-image branch for ports/private servers (found a couple of nasty bugs, fixed and now working on tests).

 16:12 <slangasek> jodh: which image are you using in canonistack that's a week old?  Surely we should have fresh images available daily?

 16:12 <stgraber> - Other

 16:12 <stgraber> - SRU/New reviews

 16:12 <stgraber> - Released pastebinit 1.4 and 1.4.1

 16:12 <stgraber> - A few merges

 16:12 <stgraber> - TODO this week

 16:12 <stgraber> - Some more LXC work, with the plan of releasing a beta3 before the sprint

 16:12 <stgraber> - Test and setup PPA builds of LXC with cgmanager now that it's in the archive

 16:12 <stgraber> - Try and get that system-image branch merged (will try to write the remaining tests on the plane)

 16:12 <stgraber> (DONE)

 16:12 <xnox> jodh: daily channell or released channel openstack/juju images?

 16:13 <jodh> slangasek/xnox: dunno - I'm calling euca-describe-images

 16:13 <slangasek> xnox: yeah, for 5.2 purposes I was trying to answer the specific question of whether the qreal size change had a practical impact on our existing app store; so I did a bit of post-processing of the a-c-c dump :)

 16:13 <xnox> slangasek: hehe. right. Hm, you have access to all appstore for analysis? can i have such access as well?

 16:14 <xnox> slangasek: or are you iterating via sso-authenticated api?

 16:14 <jodh> slangasek/xnox: newest official(?) image looks like ubuntu-daily/ubuntu-trusty-daily-amd64-server-20140116.1-disk1.img

 16:14 <slangasek> stgraber: "fixed PAM harder"> did you need me to upload the latest changes to trusty?  feel free to do so now that it's upstream

 16:15 <slangasek> stgraber: (I'd appreciate you committing your changes to the bzr branch too, of course)

 16:15 <xnox> jodh: i wonder if it's alpha2 related, i did ask for cloud image respin due to kernel bugs. Let me ping cloudy people about it.

 16:15 <jodh> xnox: cool - ta.

 16:15 <slangasek> stgraber: upstream made a few tweaks on top of your commit, so I hadn't had a chance to look at which bits we needed, smash it into a single patch, etc.

 16:15 <xnox> jodh: there is utlemming/testing/ubuntu-trusty-amd64-20140123-1390436026

 16:15 <xnox> jodh: which should have kernel fixes in.

 16:16 <jodh> xnox: yeah, saw that but don't know how vanilla it is

 16:16 <xnox> jodh: it's as prestine as ubuntu-daily

 16:16 <slangasek> xnox: I have "popey got me a dump of all the packages and posted them where I could download them" access

 16:16 <stgraber> slangasek: well, ideally we'd want to have this in Debian too since lxc-download now builds daily Debian images too, but yeah, I can apply my change straight to Ubuntu for now until you get around to cleaning things up and uploading to Debian

 16:16 <slangasek> xnox: so yeah, sso-authenticated api... one step removed

 16:16 <xnox> slangasek: popey-proxy =)

 16:16 <xnox> =))))

 16:17 <slangasek> stgraber: if you apply it to Ubuntu, I'll just pick it back into Debian :)

 16:17 * popey wakes

 16:17 <slangasek> ok - anything else on status?

 16:19 <slangasek> cjwatson: stokachu mentioned bug #833994.  Should we maybe turn this into a blueprint for what the acceptable technical approach would be, so that it doesn't keep getting rehashed?

 16:19 <ubottu> bug 833994 in debian-installer-utils (Ubuntu) "debian-installer does not support https when using with preseed files" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/833994

 16:19 <cjwatson> oh, infinity and I got grub2 working on ppc64el this morning, ish

 16:19 <slangasek> \o/

 16:19 <cjwatson> slangasek: yeah, I guess.  I don't think I have time this week though ...

 16:19 <slangasek> cjwatson: ack

 16:21 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:21 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:21 <slangasek> I guess we'll have plenty of time to talk about everything at the sprint next week, so maybe not
