 16:03 <rharper> =)

 16:03 <arosales> good release for everyone :-)

 16:03 <arosales> not sure if we have gotten a name for "U" cycle yet

 16:04 <arosales> moving on to next topic then

 16:04 <arosales> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:04 <arosales> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:05 <arosales> critical https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1304135

 16:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1304135 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "panic: runtime error: index out of range" [Critical,Triaged]

 16:05 <arosales> looks like it should be in 1.18.1 of juju-core

 16:06 <arosales> jamespag`: do we need to sru that?

 16:06 <coreycb> arosales, he's on vacation unless he's lurking

 16:06 <arosales> any other server folks available to help with SRUs?

 16:07 <arosales> rsync also looks fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rsync/+bug/1307230

 16:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1307230 in rsync (Ubuntu Trusty) "3.1.0 daemon infinite loop when no matched user in secrets" [High,Triaged]

 16:07 <arosales> but still has a task for Trusty

 16:07 <smoser> i can help with sru, and so can other ubuntu devs.

 16:07 <arosales> gaughen, smoser: anyone from server on the SRU team this cycle?

 16:07 <arosales> smoser: thanks just calling out the ones under the rls server tracking page.

 16:08 <arosales> samba bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba4/+bug/1308657

 16:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1308657 in samba4 (Ubuntu Trusty) "Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04: failed to upgrade libsmbclient:amd64 with libsmbclient:i386 installed." [High,Triaged]

 16:08 <arosales> looks like it is assisgned to Michael Vogt

 16:08 <arosales> maas: https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1310844

 16:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1310844 in maas (Ubuntu Trusty) "find_ip_via_arp() results in unpredictable, and in some cases, incorrect IP addresses" [High,Triaged]

 16:09 <arosales> still needs triaged but kirkland's got a branch out for review.

 16:09 <arosales> any maas folks or again ubuntu devs available for a review ?

 16:10 <arosales> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/maas/+bug/1310846 looks related

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1310846 in maas (Ubuntu Trusty) "amt template gives up way too easily" [High,Triaged]

 16:10 <arosales> smoser:  gaughen ^

 16:10 <lutostag> I guess that might fall into my lap

 16:11 <arosales> thanks lutostag

 16:11 <arosales> and it looks like jamespag` has https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph/+bug/1278466 in progress

 16:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1278466 in ceph (Ubuntu Trusty) "[FFe] ceph firefly stable release" [High,In progress]

 16:11 <matsubara> arosales, that maas bug has been mp'ed and reviewed by gmb here: https://code.launchpad.net/~kirkland/maas/1310844/+merge/216647

 16:11 <arosales> so that covers the high/critical bugs under server on the rls tracking page

 16:11 <smoser> lutostag, well, first to maas upstream, then back to ubuntu.

 16:11 <matsubara> well, still missing tests but gmb is on it, fwiw

 16:12 <arosales> ah good to know matsubara, thanks for the info.

 16:12 <arosales> any other bugs to discuss?

 16:12 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:12 <arosales> all blueprints are done right :-)

 16:13 <arosales> lets see

 16:13 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:13 <arosales> 84% done

 16:14 <arosales> gaughen, smoser should these be deferred, or are folks going to continue working on them until 14.04.1?

 16:14 <gaughen> arosales, there are a couple that need updating. smoser for one

 16:14 <gaughen> arosales, the ceph tasks are still relevant.

 16:14 <arosales> gaughen are you going to be making new blueprints for the u-cycle though

 16:14 <gaughen> arosales, yes, we've already started and by we I mean jamespag`

 16:15 <arosales> I suspect a lot are still valid, but just wanted to see how server is going to track them

 16:15 <arosales> gaughen: so is the plan to defer all t-cycle blueprints as new u-cycle ones are made?

 16:15 <gaughen> arosales, we've started making new ones. as the new ones appear we're moving stuff

 16:15 <smoser> well, we probably should deferfor process sake.

 16:15 <smoser> they can still be worked on, but htere is no poitn in tracking them under T release.

 16:16 <arosales> smoser: ack and thanks

 16:16 <gaughen> arosales, but like I said the ceph stuff is still open because as soon as they land firefly we'll sru the update in

 16:16 <gaughen> smoser, true

 16:16 <arosales> #action: team defer t-cycle blueprints. Put relevent tasks into new u-cycle blueprints (note http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html is 84% done)

 16:16 * meetingology : team defer t-cycle blueprints. Put relevent tasks into new u-cycle blueprints (note http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html is 84% done)

 16:18 * arosales suspects folks are resting from release, last week

 16:18 <arosales> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:19 <smb> I have been working on a hot fix for Precise drbd8 today (as always the real test won't happen before production). Can someone have a peek review at the debdiff in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/drbd8/+bug/1185756. Two positive testings but maybe we want to wait for the testing of the guy from comment #61 (if that happens) before rushing it out.

 16:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1185756 in drbd8 (Ubuntu Precise) "drbd8-utils not compatible with linux-lts-raring kernel in 12.04" [High,Fix released]

 16:19 <smb> Apart from that, nothing else if there are no questions.

 16:19 <arosales> smoser: ^

 16:20 <arosales> smb: also gcc-go wise in trusty these two bugs have been consistantly causing seg faults in juju

 16:20 <arosales> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gccgo-go/+bug/1275620

 16:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1275620 in gccgo-go (Ubuntu) "gccgo-go segfaults, something related to alternatives" [High,Fix committed]

 16:20 <arosales> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gccgo-4.9/+bug/1304754

 16:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1304754 in gccgo-4.9 (Ubuntu) "gccgo on ppc64el using split stacks when not supported" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:20 <arosales> seem to be related

 16:20 <smoser> smb, i'll look
