 16:12 <jamespage> actually horizon generally needs a good exercise due to django 1.6 upgrade

 16:14 <smoser> o/

 16:14 <jamespage> hey smoser

 16:14 <roaksoax> cool, so it seems that most of this just need to get its status updated

 16:14 <roaksoax> let's move on then

 16:14 <roaksoax> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:14 <roaksoax> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:15 <roaksoax> anyone has anything to update us on their BP's?

 16:15 <roaksoax> Please make sure to update your BP's accordingly provided that we are on Alpha 2 this week

 16:16 <roaksoax> all those WI's that couldn't make it should either be postponed or retargetted

 16:16 <roaksoax> anyone experiencing any blockers/delays?

 16:17 <yolanda> we have a meeting today for the server banner stuff

 16:17 <roaksoax> I guess not

 16:18 <yolanda> currently blocked on openstack packages

 16:18 <roaksoax> alright! thanks for the update on that one

 16:18 <roaksoax> let's move on

 16:18 <roaksoax> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:18 <roaksoax> caribou: any updates?

 16:18 <caribou> nothing on my side, thanks

 16:19 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:19 <roaksoax> psivaa: any updates?

 16:20 <roaksoax> i guess he is not around, let's come back to him

 16:20 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:20 <smb> I wanted to ask again for some help on SRUing drbd8 and iscsitarget for

 16:20 <smb> Precise (to support the Saucy kernel):

 16:20 <smb> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/iscsitarget/+bug/1262712

 16:20 <smb> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/drbd8/+bug/1185756

 16:20 <smb> I am better on the packaging side than doing the arguing with the SRU team.

 16:20 <smb> (apparently)

 16:20 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1262712 in iscsitarget (Ubuntu Precise) "[SRU] Backport iscsitarget 1.4.20.3+svn490 into Precise" [High,Triaged]

 16:20 <smb> Then just a quick notice: do not be alarmed by anything you see or experience

 16:20 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1185756 in drbd8 (Ubuntu Precise) "drbd8-utils not compatible with linux-lts-raring kernel in 12.04" [High,Confirmed]

 16:20 <smb> using the 3.13.0-4 kernel. We should be back to normality with 3.13.0-5.

 16:20 <smb> Anything you still cannot cope with, you may try to report to us but it might

 16:20 <smb> be your own problem (sorry could not resist the loose quote).

 16:20 <smb> sforshee, do you have more?

 16:20 <smb> Otherwise questions?

 16:21 <roaksoax> I;ll look at the drbd8 SRU

 16:21 <smb> roaksoax, thanks

 16:21 <roaksoax> smb: (btw I did get your ping from yesterday, but was US Holiday )

 16:22 <roaksoax> so no questions for smb? Let's move on

 16:22 <smb> roaksoax, Thats why it was so quiet on the other side of the Atlantic ... :)

 16:22 <roaksoax> jamespage: are you taking scsitarget though ?

 16:22 <roaksoax> smb: :)

 16:23 <jamespage> roaksoax, hmm-ah

 16:23 <jamespage> roaksoax, OK

 16:23 <roaksoax> ok :)

 16:24 <roaksoax> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:24 <roaksoax> rbasak: any updates?

 16:24 <rbasak> No updates from me. Any questions?

 16:24 <roaksoax> if noone has questions for rbasak let's move on

 16:24 <roaksoax> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:24 <roaksoax> any upcoming events?

 16:25 <jamespage> fosdem

 16:25 <jamespage> start of feb

 16:25 <roaksoax> jamespage: are you attending?

 16:25 * rbasak will be there

 16:25 <roaksoax> cool, so we will have representation

 16:25 <roaksoax> alright, then, it seems there's no other event so lets move on

 16:25 <roaksoax> #topic Open Discussion

 16:25 <jamespage> noper

 16:25 <roaksoax> anyone has anything to discuss today?

 16:26 <psivaa> roaksoax: sorry not sure if you've seen this:

 16:26 <psivaa> <psivaa> From our side, we have bug 1270228 impacting trusty server iso installations. Apperantly a kernel issue.

 16:26 <psivaa> <psivaa> bug #1270228

 16:26 <psivaa> <psivaa> and also there is bug 1269073 still open on tomcat

 16:26 <psivaa> <roaksoax> i guess he is not around, let's come back to him

 16:26 <psivaa> <psivaa> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1270228 the link for the first bug, sorry

 16:26 <ubottu> bug 1270228 in linux (Ubuntu) ""Loading partman-xfs failed for unknown reasons. Aborting" error in trusty server installations" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1270228

 16:26 <ubottu> bug 1269073 in tomcat7 (Ubuntu) "test_tomcat_daemon smoke test failure on images with 3.13 kernel " [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1269073

 16:26 <roaksoax> psivaa: we did! But thanks for  that

 16:27 <roaksoax> jamespage: ^^

 16:27 <roaksoax> smoser: ^^

 16:27 <roaksoax> it seems that the issue might have been identified

 16:27 <roaksoax> we will keep an eye on it

 16:27 <smb> At least partman-xfs is the weird thing I mentioned before about kernel 3.13.0-4

 16:28 <smb> The tomcat issue looks to be related to some change filling urandom quicker on boot (possibly taking away randomness from filling random)

 16:29 <roaksoax> awesome, thanks for the input

 16:29 <roaksoax> hopefully we will get some sort of solution soon

 16:29 <roaksoax> other than that

 16:29 <roaksoax> if noone has anything else to discuss

 16:29 <roaksoax> we can call it

 16:29 <roaksoax> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:29 <roaksoax> same place/time

 16:29 <roaksoax> thank's all for coming

 16:29 <roaksoax> #endmeeting
