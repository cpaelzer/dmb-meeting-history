 16:39 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:39 <jdstrand> I;ll go first

 16:40 <jdstrand> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:40 <jdstrand> I am working on openstack security updates today

 16:40 <jdstrand> I am also patch piloting

 16:40 <jdstrand> I didn't get to finishing the ofono profile set cause it is blocked on the apparmor upstart job, but that should all be resolved this week

 16:41 <sbeattie> \o/

 16:41 <jdstrand> I still have a few things to deal with from the sprint

 16:41 <jdstrand> and then other june work items (ff is 6/26)

 16:41 <jdstrand> that's it from me. marc, ty and jj are all off today

 16:41 <jdstrand> sbeattie: you're up

 16:41 <sbeattie> I'm focusing on gcc stuff again this week.

 16:42 <jdstrand> where are you on that?

 16:42 <sbeattie> I'm still digging in to why the pie stuff isn't getting set properly for some gcc testcases, as well as doing testbuilds of other packages to ensure things are working.

 16:43 <jdstrand> what do you expect the eta of that to be?

 16:43 <sbeattie> This week

 16:43 <jdstrand> this is the PIE/amd64 stuff, right?

 16:43 <sbeattie> (end of, anyway)

 16:43 <sbeattie> YEs, PIE by default of amd64

 16:43 <sbeattie> s/of/on/

 16:43 <jdstrand> cool

 16:44 <sbeattie> For apparmor stuff, I have a couple of patches to review, and a patch or two of my own to push.

 16:44 <sbeattie> That's pretty much it for me. sarnold?

 16:44 <sarnold> I'm on community this week

 16:44 <sarnold> since marc is gone today I'll make a quick pass through triage

 16:45 <sarnold> I'm returning to working on the mod_wsgi work for qrt's django tests; it's a month cold at this point, but I'm afraid how much of it will be re-learning what I knew, but I built new vms last week so hopefully they're not busted yet :)

 16:46 <sarnold> I'm also hoping for some apparmor patches to review :) I'd like som edistractions from mod_wsgi fiddling :)

 16:47 <sarnold> oh yes, filing insurance claim for malta fun.

 16:47 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:47 <jdstrand> sarnold: if you are looking for things to review, there are several work items in security-u-catchall

 16:47 <sarnold> jdstrand: ooo

 16:47 <jdstrand> (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-u-catchall)

 16:47 <sarnold> oh yes, nice long list :)

 16:48 <sarnold> thanks jdstrand :)

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> so, last week I got firefox and flash out. I still need to publish thunderbird, but there's not really a rush for that (only 3 of the advisories for firefox were applicable to thunderbird)

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> but i'll do that tomorrow :)

 16:49 <chrisccoulson> I've nearly finished bug 1312082, which has turned in to quite a sizeable piece of work

 16:49 <ubottu> bug 1312082 in Oxide "Stop using deprecated compositing paths" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1312082

 16:49 <jdstrand> thankfully, that's a one time thing

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> and then after that, I shall be clearing my review queue and picking the next task off the list (https://bugs.launchpad.net/oxide/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&assign

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> lueprints.used=&field.has_no_blueprints=on)

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> oops

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> sorry about that, I just copied the search URL from firefox

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 16:50 <jdstrand> is the next task off the list the media-hub stuff?

 16:51 <chrisccoulson> well, alex is working on that, unless I need to help out

 16:51 <jdstrand> ah, cool

 16:51 <jdstrand> well, we have a meeting on that tomorrow, so I'll just be patient

 16:52 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
