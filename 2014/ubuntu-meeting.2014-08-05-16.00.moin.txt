 16:07 <jamespage> matsubara, I think that might be quite and easy fix

 16:07 <jamespage> but I've not had time to look at it yet

 16:07 <matsubara> Should we have takers for high bugs during this meeting?

 16:08 <jamespage> matsubara, not essential

 16:08 <coreycb> jamespage, do the tests need to be disabled for that one?

 16:08 <matsubara> coreycb, beisner: want to take a stab at it since you guys are directly involved with openstack stuff?

 16:08 <jamespage> coreycb, they are right now - we just ignore the result

 16:09 <coreycb> matsubara, I'll take that one

 16:09 <jamespage> but I've tried to raise bugs for when we have todo that
