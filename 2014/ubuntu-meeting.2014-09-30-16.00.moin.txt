 16:04 <beisner> so final beta & final beta freeze was last wk

 16:05 <beisner> next milestone in U release:  Oct 9  kernel freeze

 16:05 <beisner> any other points re: release schedule?

 16:05 <smoser> and we released beta of cloud images.  (http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/utopic/beta-2/)

 16:06 <smoser> well, we're in crunch time now.

 16:06 <beisner> great!  thanks smoser.

 16:06 <smoser> if you're aware of issues in ubuntu, now is the time to raise them to someone.

 16:06 <beisner> down to the wire indeed

 16:06 <beisner> speaking of...

 16:06 <beisner> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:07 <beisner> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-u-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:07 <kickinz1> confirm pb with bcache needing a reboot to discard the caching device

 16:07 <beisner> kickinz1, is there a bug?

 16:08 <beisner> no critical bugs atm, woot.

 16:08 <beisner> several bugs unassigned, do we need to pin that down?

 16:09 <kickinz1> yes if you do a mistake when creating a bcache device (ie swapping backing and caching, wrong backing) it still creats a bad bcache device, but you cannnot control it unti you poweroff the machine, to re-create it...

 16:10 <kickinz1> I'll chat with rbasak to know who to send this to

 16:10 <beisner> ok let's make sure we get a big filed

 16:10 <beisner> rewinding a sec...  there was an action item.  "rbasak to review mysql-5.6 transition plans with ABI breaks with infinity"

 16:11 <beisner> rbasak appears to be offline

 16:11 <rbasak> o/

 16:12 <beisner> hi !

 16:12 <beisner> rbasak, anything to note on review mysql-5.6 transition / abi infinity action?

 16:12 <rbasak> We decided to defer the 5.6 move for this cycle.

 16:12 <beisner> ok thank you

 16:13 <rbasak> We felt it was too late given the ABI concerns.

 16:13 <beisner> any other bug issues to raise or discuss?

 16:13 <beisner> moving on then

 16:13 <beisner> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:16 <beisner> #action all to review blueprint work items before next weeks meeting

 16:16 * meetingology all to review blueprint work items before next weeks meeting

 16:16 <beisner> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:16 <caribou> Hi, everything is good on my side, thanks

 16:16 <beisner> hi caribou

 16:16 <beisner> ack thank you

 16:17 <beisner> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:18 <beisner> I see a lot of activity in qa iso tracker, looks like test cases are getting the usual late-cycle manual runs.

 16:18 <beisner> psivaa, anything else to note?

 16:18 <beisner> on to kernel...

 16:18 <beisner> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:18 <smb> Hi. One thing I seem to hit in Utopic is that libvirt and xen init seem to be more affected to race against each other on boot up. Though I need to get more data there. Other than that I only wished I could make systemd-logind shut up about things I do not care about anyway (for good). Those attack my senses for a nice login on vt1...  :-P That's all. Questions?

 16:19 <beisner> smb is always sooo fast to respond!

 16:19 * smb tries to be prepared

 16:19 <hallyn> he has an expect script

 16:19 <smb> oh yeah, should write a chat bot for myself

 16:19 <smb> :)

 16:20 <beisner> is this the real smb? [-.-]

 16:20 <smb> how do you think about the real smb?

 16:21 <beisner> does this smb bot have #vote?

 16:21 <beisner> ok anyway, any discussion re: libvirt xen init issue?

 16:21 <smb> beisner, no just for info

 16:22 <smb> I look into it

 16:22 <beisner> thanks smb

 16:22 <beisner> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:22 <beisner> i don't think there are any to announce.

 16:22 <beisner> #topic Open Discussion

 16:23 <beisner> (quiet in here)

 16:23 * beisner checks network connection

 16:23 <beisner> ok, i think we can all go back to crunch time.

 16:23 <beisner> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:24 <beisner> +1 week, same place, same time.

 16:24 <beisner> thank you all

 16:24 <beisner> #endmeeting
