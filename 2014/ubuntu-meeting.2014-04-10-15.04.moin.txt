 15:15 <slangasek> :)

 15:16 <slangasek> any questions above?

 15:17 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Trusty release freeze

 15:17 <slangasek> final freeze is in, um, some small number of hours

 15:18 <slangasek> is there anything pending that we should talk about before we get there?

 15:18 <infinity> 6

 15:18 <infinity> hours, not uploads.

 15:18 <slangasek> (that maybe you're desperately working on right now to get in before the deadline, and it might be helpful to give your friends in the release team a heads-up that it's on its way)

 15:19 <infinity> I'm going to lob a glibc at the archive soon.  Was just waiting on final word from Adhemerval that he has no last-minute ppc fixes for me.

 15:19 <cjwatson> I have the GRUB LVM snapshot fix, think I have something plausible now

 15:19 <stgraber> we'll probably have a cgmanager fix

 15:19 <xnox> ubiquity... upstart...

 15:19 <mvo> it might be nice to get one software-center upload to get 2 common errors.ubuntu.com issues off the table but I'm not sure who is doing this these days

 15:19 <cjwatson> (Now that I've worked out that it isn't actually a problem in the core C code at all, but a grub-mkconfig scripting bug)

 15:19 <slangasek> ok, so nothing major anywhere then ;)

 15:19 <slangasek> just grub ubiquity upstart cgmanager and glibc

 15:19 <infinity> Nah, business as usual.

 15:19 <stgraber> there's a somewhat rare condition where logind will get stuck and use 100% of your CPU, hallyn is looking into that now and managed to reproduce it a couple minutes ago

 15:19 <infinity> No one needs those packages.

 15:20 <cjwatson> slangasek: what did you expect from this team, fluffy desktop stuff? :)

 15:20 <xnox> mvo: software-center -> we've been just uploading it with $ debsign & dput so far.

 15:20 <slangasek> stgraber: sounds like a clear bugfix that would qualify during final freeze, provided that we figure it out

 15:21 <mvo> xnox: thanks

 15:21 <doko> have two fixes pending: fixing the python3.4 ftbfs on aarch64,  and landing the python3.4 ensurepip fix (which I'll look at with barry today)

 15:21 <xnox> mvo: you can poke Rodney Dawes about it (e.g. reviews / uploads) or just upload.

 15:21 <slangasek> cjwatson: no, the fluffy is for the cloud server

 15:21 <doko> preferring to fix the ftbfs on aarch64 with the just uploaded binutils

 15:22 <stgraber> slangasek: yeah, all we know for know is that in some cases we get stuck in a loop of EAGAIN inside the nih auto-generated code, hopefully it's just caused by an actual bug in cgmanager's dbus service and not by a bug in the code generator :)

 15:22 <doko> did the release team discuss icedtea-web?

 15:23 <doko> and I assume it's a bit late for the valgrind update ...

 15:23 <cjwatson> I think everyone's scared off by the diff, but nobody has rejected it yet

 15:24 <doko> valgrind is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/valgrind/+bug/1300070

 15:24 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1300070 in valgrind (Ubuntu Trusty) "valgrind 3.10/trunk update to support AArch64" [Undecided,New]

 15:24 <slangasek> doko: I didn't see any discussion, I think it's been suffering from queue starvation for a lot of other stuff coming through hot.  Did you get the valgrind testing from the phone folks?

 15:25 <slangasek> (if you're waiting for the release team to drive that, it probably won't get done in time)

 15:25 <doko> have to check with tvoss ...

 15:25 <slangasek> ok

 15:25 <doko> hmm, maybe a bad time to discuss with him ...

 15:26 <slangasek> doko: nah, he's /back/ to work now

 15:26 <slangasek> AIUI

 15:26 <infinity> That was a quick parental leave.

 15:26 <slangasek> well, ICBW

 15:26 <slangasek> and other acronyms

 15:27 <slangasek> so yeah, maybe you do want someone other than tvoss.  kgunn?

 15:27 <infinity> InterContinental Ballistic Weasels?

 15:27 <slangasek> infinity: wessels

 15:29 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:29 <slangasek> anything else, besides uploading half the base system 5h before freeze?

 15:30 <infinity> We could do the other half too.

 15:30 <stgraber> 5h is way too optimistic, I expect most of those to be uploaded within an hour of the freeze ;)

 15:31 * slangasek gets an ulcer

 15:31 <infinity> Slightly more seriously, if people have good ideas (markety or buggy) for the release notes, it's a wiki, go add crap.  I can always delete if we have too much, but no one likes panicing to write it all on Thursday morning.

 15:31 <doko> no more planned openjdk and gcc uploads today

 15:31 <infinity> doko: I like the "today" qualifier on that.

 15:31 <slangasek> doko: oh, just the unplanned ones

 15:31 <xnox> infinity: did you just stage wiki page dead-lock?! =)

 15:32 <infinity> xnox: No, because no one will do it.

 15:32 * slangasek turns and points at everyone else in the channel

 15:33 <slangasek> do we have a list of release-notey bugs to work from, this cycle?

 15:33 <infinity> Don't know if people have been adding tasks.

 15:33 * xnox was doing random searches of high/critical and things targeted at trusty milestones. it's not much

 15:33 <doko> damn, you did catch both "unplanned" and "today" ...

 15:33 <infinity> There's always the ISO tracker bugs, but I'd like to think we'll fix the worst ones and pretend the rest don't exist because we're awesome.

 15:33 <stgraber> I don't think we've been particularly good at targeting + tagging bugs this cycle

 15:34 <xnox> the "rls-management" report is not very useful either.

 15:34 <slangasek> xnox: there's an ubuntu-release-notes project

 15:34 <slangasek> if things should be release noted, and you don't have time to write the blurb, please target a task there

 15:34 <slangasek> and if you do have time to write the blurb, look there for things that might need writing :)

 15:35 <xnox> they look old...

 15:36 <slangasek> xnox: old ones ought to be wontfixed

 15:36 <bdmurray> xnox: which rls-management report?

 15:36 <slangasek> we're not realistically going to update the saucy release notes now

 15:36 <xnox> bdmurray: rls-tracking/notracking/wontfixing

 15:36 <xnox> bdmurray: http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 15:36 <infinity> To be fair, we've tended in the past to be a bit too liberal in our release noteyness.  If it doesn't cause people installation/upgrade headaches or other such nastiness, it's just a bug, not a bug worth telling every single person about.

 15:37 <slangasek> infinity: I disagree; major bugs that are going to be FAQs if we don't document them are worth including

 15:37 <slangasek> not just bugs specifically related to installation and upgrade

 15:37 <infinity> slangasek: That falls under "other nastiness", I suspect.  It's a judgement call.

 15:38 <slangasek> (and it's not really telling "everyone", just the .3% of users who read the release notes ;)

 15:38 <infinity> slangasek: But there were people in the past that felt that anything with a release-notes task or a tracker link was release note worthy just cause. ;)

 15:38 <slangasek> right, Judgement must be Exercised

 15:39 <infinity> Oh joy.  A glibc regression on (only) power8 that I now need to sort out if I just introduced or if it's always been there but I've never run the testsuit on P8 before.

 15:39 <slangasek> infinity: enjoy

 15:39 <infinity> (Betting the latter)

 15:39 <xnox> slangasek: i wonder if both firefox and thunderbird need uploading. Firefox - because of nbs dependency & Thunderbird to drop U1 from sendit plugin.

 15:40 <xnox> unless both things are in the works.

 15:40 <infinity> xnox: I'm on firefox already.

 15:40 <slangasek> xnox: AIUI dropping the thunderbird plugin was not strictly required

 15:40 <slangasek> infinity: why is that not for the desktop team to take care of?

 15:40 <infinity> xnox: I've had the fix committed for weeks, but now that we're past the point of no return for Chris uploading new versions (ie: I won't let him), I'll take care of it. :P

 15:41 <infinity> slangasek: Well, like I said, I committed the fix to bzr weeks ago.

 15:41 <infinity> slangasek: Under the assumption that it would magically land in Chris's next upload.  And there wasn't one. :)

 15:41 <xnox> infinity: which branches are used for thunderbird/firefox? (i lost track of the thunderbird patch)

 15:41 <xnox> slangasek: ack.

 15:42 <slangasek> ok

 15:42 <slangasek> so, enough talk, back to action :)

 15:42 <slangasek> #endmeeting
