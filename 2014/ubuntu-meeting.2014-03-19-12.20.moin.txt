 12:21 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for March 19, 2014. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:22 <jared> Just as a quick introduction we're going to be running with 2 Community Council members joining us to fill quorum, thanks cprofitt and pleia2

 12:22 <jared> There is precedent for CC members filling in on the membership board to reach quorum so while it's not a written rule we're going to run with it

 12:23 <jared> #topic system76chick 's membership application

 12:23 <jared> system76chick: can you please give a 2 - 3 sentence introduction of yourself to the board

 12:24 <jared> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/system76chick

 12:26 <system76chick> My name is Emma and I live in Colorado. I love Ubuntu and I'm the leader of the Colorado Ubuntu team.

 12:28 <jared> system76chick: I see you've been involved with getting the Colorado back to being approved, can you explain a bit about what that entailed for you, is there much support over there?

 12:30 <system76chick> I'm responsible for planning all our events, updating our team wiki, responding to new Colorado users on our mailing list and encouraging local people to start using Ubuntu by helping install on their computer. For our team approval, I created a plan to get our team more active and everyone was very supportive of my initiative.

 12:31 <jared> system76chick: and how have you found the good people of Colorado? Do you get many regulars pitching in to help?

 12:32 <system76chick> People come to my events and offer advice on how to get more active. My first release party had 20+ members.

 12:32 <pleia2> that's quite good

 12:32 <jared> system76chick: good effort really, these things can be hard to get motivation for

 12:32 <system76chick> Team members help respond to mailing list inquiries if people don't email me directly.

 12:33 <jared> system76chick: good to hear, I am looking over your application and see some testimonials which is great, are there any loco members here to cheer for you?

 12:33 <jose> well, there's a loco council member, does that count?

 12:33 <cprofitt> system76chick: how many years have you been involved with the Ubuntu community?

 12:34 <system76chick> Most of my coworkers are part of the team, so it helps to work with them every day. My boss is very supportive of everything I try.

 12:34 <micahg> jose: sure :)

 12:34 <pleia2> that's great :)

 12:34 <jared> jose: indeed, just seeing if there are locals as well :)

 12:34 <system76chick> 2 years, Jose and Lyz hopefully!

 12:34 <pleia2> it's 6:30 am there in CO :\

 12:35 <jose> I wanted to mention how responsive system76chick was during the verification process, we tried to do this as quickly as possible and with her we got everything ready to go in less than a week

 12:35 <jared> jose: that sounds like a well functioning team if they can put it all together in under a week.

 12:35 <system76chick> Thank you Jose. You were a major help in that process. Your support really kept me going!

 12:36 <jose> :)

 12:36 <jose> the team is going good as far as the LC concerns, so yep!

 12:36 <cprofitt> sounds like you are doing some good work system76chick

 12:36 <system76chick> Thank you! We have 5 events in April!

 12:37 <pleia2> wow, nice

 12:37 <micahg> very nice

 12:38 <system76chick> I hope to get our team blog updated, but I need to get volunteers from our team to help. That would be a great resource for new Ubuntu users in Colorado

 12:39 <jared> system76chick: seems like we've run out of questions, so thanks for that
