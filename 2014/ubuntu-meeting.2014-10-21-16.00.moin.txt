 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:00 <kickinz1> \o

 16:00 <rbasak> I see no action points from the last meeting.

 16:01 <rbasak> #topic Utopic Development

 16:01 <rbasak> Release in two days! Are we ready?

 16:01 <caribou> rbasak: shouldn't it be Vivid now ;-) ?

 16:01 <rbasak> Vivid isn't open for development yet :-P

 16:01 <rbasak> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:01 <rbasak> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-u-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:02 <rharper> o/

 16:03 <jamespage> \o

 16:03 <lutostag> o/

 16:03 <rbasak> I think the High and Critical bugs in this list are already being taken care of.

 16:03 <matsubara> o/

 16:03 <rbasak> It looks unlikely that the rest are going to be fixed at this stage of the cycle.

 16:03 <rbasak> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:04 <rbasak> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-u/group/topic-u-server.html

 16:04 <rbasak> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-u-server

 16:04 <rbasak> Can everyone update their blueprints?

 16:04 <rbasak> I see a fair bit left here still.

 16:04 <rbasak> Presumably these are already done or won't make it?

 16:05 <rbasak> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:05 <rbasak> caribou: over to you

 16:05 <caribou> rbasak: nothing particular; working on automating kdump-tool testing

 16:05 <rbasak> OK, thanks!

 16:05 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:06 <rbasak> psivaa_: around?

 16:06 <psivaa_> rbasak: not much of an update from us

 16:06 <rbasak> OK. Any questions for psivaa_?

 16:06 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:06 <smb> Nothing from here.

 16:07 <rbasak> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:07 <coreycb> o/

 16:07 <rbasak> OpenStack Summit is coming up of course.

 16:07 <rbasak> Anything else?

 16:07 <rbasak> Discuss EOLing qemu machine types (and legacy roms) (hallyn, rharper)

 16:07 <rbasak> hallyn can't make it, so deferring this until the next meeting.

 16:08 <rbasak> #topic Open Discussion

 16:08 <rbasak> Does anything have anything they'd like to raise?

 16:08 <rharper> rbasak: I'm here if you wanted to discuss the EOLing a bit

 16:08 <rbasak> Sure.

 16:08 <rbasak> Is there a decision we need to make here?

 16:09 <rharper> so background, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QemuPTMigration

 16:10 <rharper> there is a decision w.r.t how long/how far to care the the legacy machine types from previous LTS releases w.r.t do we support live migration from an instance on an old LTS to current release

 16:10 <rharper> there is on-going maint. w.r.t keeping roms around , as well as handling any of the potential issues w.r.t qemu machine imcompatibility  between releases.

 16:11 <rbasak> Can I suggest that this goes to an appropriate mailing list?

 16:11 <rharper> from trusty onward, qemu has a ubuntu_release named machine which will help disambiguate it from the defaults in qemu

 16:11 <rharper> rbasak: indeed

 16:11 <rbasak> It sounds like there are some complicated implications here, and we should make sure that stakeholders have an opportunity to comment.

 16:11 <coreycb> rharper, and maybe to an openstack mailing list

 16:11 <rharper> rbasak: additionally coreycb brought up that this hits openstack upgrades with folks doing a precise -> trusty upgrade

 16:11 <rbasak> coreycb: +1

 16:12 <rbasak> Thanks for summarising the issue.

 16:12 <rharper> sure

 16:12 <coreycb> rharper, upgrades to trusty that are entirely on precise too

 16:12 <rbasak> Shall we leave this for now then, and take it to an ML?

 16:12 <rharper> I think that's best

 16:12 <rbasak> Any other topics for Open Discussion?

 16:13 <coreycb> s/trusty/icehoue above

 16:13 <rbasak> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:13 <coreycb> icehouse

 16:13 <rbasak> The next meeting will be on Tue Oct 28 16:00:00 UTC 2014.

 16:13 <rbasak> hallyn will chair.

 16:13 <rbasak> I don't think there's anything on that will clash with that, right?

 16:14 <gnuoy> Norwich beer festival

 16:14 <rbasak> :-)

 16:14 <caribou> haloween ?

 16:14 <rbasak> "Apologies for my absense, I was drinking beer"

 16:14 <rbasak> #endmeeting
