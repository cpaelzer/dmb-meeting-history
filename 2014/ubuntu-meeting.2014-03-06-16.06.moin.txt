 16:19 <slangasek> cjohnston:

 16:19 <slangasek> er

 16:19 <slangasek> cjwatson:

 16:20 <cjwatson> Cherry-picked several easy fixes (mostly build/packaging, and bug 1285790) from my libclick work and landed them in click 0.4.16, by way of CI Train practice.

 16:20 <ubottu> bug 1285790 in click (Ubuntu) "click crashed with BrokenPipeError in run(): [Errno 32] Broken pipe" [Low,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1285790

 16:20 <cjwatson> Pushed libclick out for review.  Went through my own proofreading pass in parallel; found and fixed several bugs.

 16:20 <cjwatson> Started work on converting some known click clients (upstart-app-launch, unity-scope-click, clickmanager-plugin) to libclick.  Some of this will need library equivalents of "click info" and "click list", so started on those too.

 16:20 <cjwatson> Worked on a branch to expose supported frameworks in libclick.

 16:20 <cjwatson> Landing libclick at the moment.  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~click-hackers/click/trunk/files/head:/click/tests/ (esp. gimock.py and some test file such as test_hooks.py) if you're interested in the crazy scheme I was talking about last week.

 16:20 <cjwatson> Fixed up python-tblib build problems (planning to use this for click later).

 16:20 <cjwatson> Merged gnutls28 security fixes.

 16:20 <cjwatson> Attempted to get ghc/arm64 building, prompted by a thread on ubuntu-devel-discuss; predictably failed.

 16:21 <cjwatson> Rooted my phone and set it up to dual-boot Ubuntu, so that I have a test system that doesn't make me want to throw things.

 16:21 <cjwatson> ..

 16:22 <xnox> * python3:

 16:22 <xnox> - unity8, ubuntu-ui-toolkit, ofono, a few more clicks all landed.

 16:22 <xnox> - next up: land phablet-tools py2&3 support

 16:22 <xnox> - next up: continue testing/landing remaining clicks

 16:22 <xnox> * touch-x86:

 16:22 <xnox> - worked on fixing up x86 cross toolchain, it still does not build

 16:22 <xnox> with ssp.

 16:22 <xnox> * upstart/touch printing:

 16:22 <xnox> - fixed cups socket activation with upstart, it mostly was s/-F/-f/

 16:22 <xnox> in the cups upstart job + correct typos. (both -F/-f mean

 16:22 <xnox> foreground, both change fg variable 0 => 1/-1, most things test for

 16:22 <xnox> !fg, apart from one small portion which closes all passed FDs when

 16:22 <ubottu> xnox: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

 16:22 <xnox> running with -F instead of -f)

 16:22 <xnox> - reviewed a few upstart merge proposals. We should be good for a

 16:22 <xnox> bugfix heavy upstart release.

 16:22 <xnox> * aa/+1:

 16:22 <xnox> - disentangled libav8 NBS by fixing a few packages and uploading

 16:22 <xnox> patches to port mplayer to libav9 from gentoo, thus there is little

 16:22 <xnox> removal damage - two small leave packages. (mplayer on the other

 16:22 <xnox> hand has a lot of reverse dependencies).

 16:22 <xnox> ..

 16:23 <doko> x86 cross toolchain?

 16:23 <cjwatson> x86 bionic I guess?

 16:23 <xnox> yes.

 16:23 <doko> ahh, ok

 16:23 <doko> based on which 4.x?

 16:23 <cjwatson> cross for small values of cross

 16:24 <xnox> doko: 4.7, but it compiles bionic libc, somehow with missing symbols required for a working ssp. thus nothing links.

 16:24 <stgraber> LXC:

 16:24 <stgraber> - Fixed quite a few lxc-ls bugs (nested unpriv containers, stopped containers, dealing with invalid config, ...)

 16:24 <stgraber> - Fixed a small bug in the python3-lxc binding (missing exported function).

 16:24 <stgraber> - Fixed some more corner cases of lxc-download

 16:24 <stgraber> - Code reviews, testing and LXC on Android debugging

 16:24 <stgraber> - Preparing for LXC 1.0.1, scheduled for later today

 16:24 <stgraber> CGManager support for logind:

 16:24 <stgraber> - Got a patch covering all code paths we care about, now I just need to make this actually work...

 16:24 <stgraber> - Landing for this will be blocked by the cgmanager MIR and by its own FFe

 16:24 <stgraber> Networking:

 16:24 <stgraber> - Re-applied our ifenslave-2.6 delta to the new ifenslave source

 16:25 <stgraber> - Started going through some of the bug reports

 16:25 <stgraber> System-image:

 16:25 <stgraber> - Reviewed and merge/rejected all pending MPs for system-image/server

 16:25 <stgraber> - Implemented code to rename channels and to create channel redirects (to transition users after a rename)

 16:25 <stgraber> - Tested the planned rename of all existing channels to ubuntu-touch/<channel name>

 16:25 <stgraber> Other:

 16:25 <stgraber> - Did a click landing.

 16:25 <stgraber> (DONE)

 16:26 <slangasek> ok, any questions over status?

 16:28 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:28 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:28 <bdmurray> could somebody look at bug 1288171?

 16:28 <ubottu> bug 1288171 in python-apt (Ubuntu Trusty) "0.9.3 regression: Setting APT::Architecture now downloads wrong indexes" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1288171

 16:29 <barry> i will take a look

 16:29 <xnox> cjwatson: re:click landings what about lp:~xnox/click/chroot-sessions?

 16:29 <cjwatson> queued :)

 16:29 <barry> (it's already on my radar, i.e. browser tab)

 16:29 <cjwatson> I haven't forgotten, just been head-down on libclick

 16:29 <xnox> cjwatson: ack.

 16:31 <cjwatson> nothing else from here

 16:32 <slangasek> #endmeeting
