 16:35 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:35 <jdstrand> Felix Geyer (debfx) provided debdiffs for precise-trusty for mod-wsgi (LP: #1322338). Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job!

 16:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1322338 in mod-wsgi (Ubuntu Utopic) "CVE 2014-0240 and CVE 2014-0242" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1322338

 16:35 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:35 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:36 <jdstrand> short week this week. I am off Wednesday

 16:36 <jdstrand> I'm on community this week

 16:36 <jdstrand> I need to send my ofono hardening work to the phonedations team (ie, where only certain applications can communicate to ofono)

 16:36 <jdstrand> there is a bit more work to do there, but I have it working on my phone, so that is good

 16:37 <jdstrand> I have been doing phablet kernel testing for jjohansen-- mako looks good so far, still need to do flo and goldfish, but I imagine jjohansen has those tested already

 16:37 <jdstrand> I am working on several different openstack updates

 16:38 <jdstrand> and have various sprint outcomes to still go through

 16:38 <jjohansen> sure I've run those, there are some basic policy updates, but jdstrand has seen those already

 16:39 <jjohansen> jdstrand: you pulled in the new apparmor package correct?

 16:39 <jdstrand> jjohansen: yes

 16:39 <jjohansen> okay good

 16:39 <jdstrand> we need to get this into utopic so our delta is as small as possible when we update for abstract, but we can talk about that in jjohansen's time

 16:40 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:40 <mdeslaur> I have some json-c packages to test, and am currently working on dpkg updates

 16:40 <mdeslaur> also have to do the non-trivial libtasn backports

 16:41 <mdeslaur> tomorrow, I'm doing a Q&A for UDS^H^H^Hwhatever replaces UDS

 16:41 <jdstrand> oh, I guess there is UOS too

 16:41 <jdstrand> (jeez, busy week)

 16:41 * sbeattie collects rotten tomatoes for that

 16:41 <mdeslaur> and I need to look at an updated apparmor package for U

 16:41 <mdeslaur> jjohansen's packages is missing a couple of the latest commits, which I guess we're going to want

 16:42 <mdeslaur> so I'll remerge from trunk I guess

 16:42 <mdeslaur> and, yeah, attend UOS

 16:42 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: O_o I pulled that fresh on friday

 16:42 <jjohansen> not that the debian packaging side doesn't need some fixing :)

 16:43 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: oh, the two missing commits are freom friday

 16:43 <mdeslaur> d'oh

 16:43 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: yeah, I'll take a look and see if everything's good with the packaging

 16:43 <jjohansen> haha, nice

 16:44 <mdeslaur> that's it from me, sbeattie?

 16:44 <sbeattie> I'm focusing again on getting pie by default for amd64 in gcc this week

 16:44 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: what's the current status?

 16:44 <sbeattie> I have a test compiler that bootstraps and does the right for common cases.

 16:45 <sbeattie> There's a couple of situations that the gcc testsuite where it's not compiling the .o with -fPIE when it needs to, but tries to link with -pie, which fails, so I'm tracking down why that fails.

 16:46 <sbeattie> I'm in the middle of setting up a ppa with that compiler as the default, to enable wider testing/benchmarking.

 16:46 <mdeslaur> cool

 16:47 <sbeattie> I have some apparmor patches to review and submit.

 16:47 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: oh, are those good for U too?

 16:47 <sbeattie> mdeslaur: cboltz's patch is, yes, though I need to dig in to why I can't reproduce his failure in U.

 16:48 <mdeslaur> ok

 16:48 <sbeattie> I may try to take a swap day off on friday...

 16:48 <sbeattie> And I'll be attending UOS.

 16:49 <sbeattie> That's it for me, I think. tyhicks?

 16:49 <tyhicks> I'm focusing on my kdbus work item this week

 16:49 <tyhicks> I keep letting myself get distracted by other work, so I'm only going to plan on that one work item

 16:49 <tyhicks> I'll sync up w/ everyone once it is done for what I should focus on next

 16:49 <tyhicks> (Some UOS for me this week, as well)

 16:49 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 16:49 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:50 <jjohansen> So I've got UOS to distract me this week, and a couple of bugs to poke at and at least triage

 16:51 <jjohansen> We have the utopic touch device kernels in testing, and I think ready to be pulled

 16:51 <jjohansen> so I will send that request out as soon as its dependencies fall into place (maybe this week)

 16:52 <mdeslaur> is anything there waiting on a new userspace?

 16:52 <jjohansen> This basically falls out as: more testing, policy updates, and the new apparmor userspace in U

 16:53 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: yep, the kernel won't go until that is updated, reason: userspace fixes a compiler issue that results in policy that causes failures under the new kernel

 16:53 <mdeslaur> hrm

 16:53 <mdeslaur> ok

 16:53 <mdeslaur> guess I'll work on that tomorrow or wed then

 16:55 <jjohansen> Besides testing/collaborating with jdstrand on the policy updates, I'll be working on the apparmor kernel module

 16:55 * mdeslaur still needs to figure out how he got volunteered to do the U update

 16:55 <jjohansen> to finish up the missing pieces

 16:56 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: well it was one of those quick mdeslaur isn't paying attention get him to agree while he is distracted

 16:56 <sbeattie> mdeslaur: we sent you out to collect beer and cheetos while we decided, to help the volunteering process along.

 16:56 <sarnold> I'm wondering when we're goign to tell mdeslaur he also volunteered for the T update...

 16:56 <jdstrand> jjohansen: policy updates should all be in place

 16:56 * mdeslaur shakes fist at team

 16:57 <jjohansen> jdstrand: when will they hit the images?

 16:57 <jdstrand> they are there

 16:57 <jdstrand> check that off your list :)

 16:57 <jjohansen> okay, I'll update and see how it goes, and then check it off the list :P

 16:58 <jjohansen> I think that is it for me, sarnold your up

 16:58 <jdstrand> on mako I have no denials except with media-hub, but that is unrelated

 16:58 <jdstrand> (it also works fine and I've pinged jhodapp about it)

 16:59 <jjohansen> jdstrand: I expect everything will be fine, I just want to run it through the 4 devices to make sure

 16:59 <jdstrand> sure

 16:59 * jjohansen wants to avoid the whole your new kernel broke, ... mess

 17:01 <sarnold> I'm on triage this week; I'm also reading some angry tweets for UOS, investigating click packaging to see how authenticity checks are being performed, and if there's any time left returning to the interminable mod_wsgi fixes for django

 17:01 <sarnold> I think that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> this week, it's mozilla updates for me

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> plus one other update

 17:02 <chrisccoulson> my other main task is fixing bug 1312082, which I hope to have done this week

 17:02 <ubottu> bug 1312082 in Oxide "Stop using deprecated compositing paths" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1312082

 17:03 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: so will the new paths be next on the deprecated list, or are they the current ones? :)

 17:03 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, no, we'll be using the same path as all other platforms :)

 17:03 <mdeslaur> oh cool :)

 17:04 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 17:06 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: moving away from the deprecated paths is required for the media-hub work to really start, correct?

 17:06 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, there's parts of that which can be started without it

 17:07 <jdstrand> sure, but this has to be done for it

 17:07 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: the others are starting on the parts that can be done now, no?

 17:07 <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, yeah, I think so

 17:07 * jdstrand saw various bug assignments, etc last week

 17:07 <jdstrand> cool

 17:07 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages
