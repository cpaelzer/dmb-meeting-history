 16:02 <smoser> shoudln't it be vivid ?

 16:02 <hallyn> uh, yeah

 16:02 <smoser> sure. anyway.

 16:02 <hallyn> hm, think i got that wrong ina  changelog this mroning

 16:02 <smoser> right now, we're clearly just starting with this vivid thing.

 16:02 <smoser> and hallyn is catching up

 16:02 <smoser> so development at this point would consist of merging from debian, and thinking of feature development / work for the cycle.

 16:03 <smoser> and getting blue prints together.

 16:03 <hallyn> any timeline for blueprint creation?

 16:04 <hallyn> smoser:

 16:04 <smoser> i dont know actually. i'm not that far along.

 16:04 <hallyn> ok

 16:04 <hallyn> thanks

 16:05 <hallyn> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:05 <caribou> nothing particular from our side

 16:05 <caribou> any question ?

 16:05 <hallyn> sounds like no, thanks caribou.  moving on,

 16:05 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:06 <hallyn> psivaa_: anything for the server meeting today?

 16:06 <hallyn> sounds like no, moving on,

 16:06 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:07 <smb> nothing from here today

 16:07 <hallyn> thanks smb

 16:07 <hallyn> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:07 <hallyn> we've got ODS next week of course,

 16:07 <hallyn> anything else?

 16:07 <rbasak> UOS is coming up too.

 16:07 <hallyn> good point.  and when is that?

 16:08 <hallyn> nov 12

 16:08 <hallyn> http://summit.ubuntu.com/uos-1411/

 16:08 * rbasak can't find the reminder email he just received

 16:08 <rbasak> Ah, thanks.

 16:08 <rbasak> It's be good to get any blueprint level items agreed before UOS, so we can make decisions during UOS itself instead of endless debate.

 16:08 <hallyn> ok i see that disucssing EOLing of machine type sis still on teh agenda, but as i recall it was decided that should be brought up on the m-l instead,

 16:09 <hallyn> #action hallyn to discuss machine type EOLing on ubuntu-server m-l

 16:09 * meetingology hallyn to discuss machine type EOLing on ubuntu-server m-l

 16:09 <smoser> thank you rbasak

 16:09 <hallyn> rbasak: should we do some semi-organized thing where we email proposed blueprints to the mailing list?

 16:09 <rbasak> That's a good idea.

 16:10 <hallyn> ok, let's codify that,

 16:10 <hallyn> #action everyone to email blueprint proposals to mailing list for discussion

 16:10 * meetingology everyone to email blueprint proposals to mailing list for discussion

 16:10 <hallyn> thanks, moving on,

 16:10 <hallyn> #topic Open Discussion

 16:10 <rbasak> Juju 1.20 will be hitting Trusty in an SRU soon.

 16:11 <hallyn> compeltely backward-compat??

 16:11 <rbasak> This is a major version update, so I'd encourage everyone using Juju to test the upload when it arrives in trusty-proposed, and let us know of any regressions.

 16:11 <rbasak> Yes, it should be fully compatible.

 16:11 <hallyn> perhaps we should have an agenda item for next week to ask who's been testing?

 16:11 <rbasak> You might want to update your deployment, but that's up to you.

 16:11 <rbasak> I'm tracking testing in the bug - bug 1386144.

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1386144 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "juju-core 1.20.11 is not packaged in Ubuntu" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1386144

 16:11 <hallyn> oh, but are we having a meeting next week, or will everyoen be gone for ods

 16:12 <hallyn> rbasak: sounds good

 16:12 <rbasak> Probably not worth having a meeting next week?

 16:12 <hallyn> yeah let's skip to the next week

 16:12 <hallyn> any other items for open discussion

 16:12 <rbasak> Next week a bunch of Canonicalers will be at a sprint

 16:12 <rbasak> Oh, no, that's the week after.

 16:12 <rbasak> Sorry.

 16:13 <hallyn> ok, so moving on,

 16:13 <hallyn> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:13 <hallyn> Should be in two weeks, Tuesday Nov 11 2014, 16:00 utc as usual,

 16:13 <hallyn> matsubara will be chairing

 16:13 <hallyn> thanks everyeone,

 16:13 <hallyn> #endmeeting
