 16:08 <psivaa> matsubara: i have been doing so far

 16:09 <matsubara> psivaa, ah, cool. Looks like the report for vivid ( http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-v-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server) is not up yet.

 16:09 <psivaa> matsubara: that could be someone from QA team i suppose

 16:09 <matsubara> psivaa, I'll look into that after the meeting then. Thanks!

 16:09 <matsubara> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:09 <smb> I did a few stable uploads for Xen in Utopic and Trusty. Though zul, you may want to hold back doing cloud-archive versions. There is more to come. ;) Also from some email report on xen-devel there are a few things missing to make openstack and xen a better experience (bug #1396068 and bug #1394327 at least). I am working on getting things applied and SRUed. Other than that I have nothing.

 16:09 <psivaa> matsubara: would you mind following this up with jfunk

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1396068 in xen (Ubuntu Utopic) "[Xen/xl] dom0 needs to run qemu for qcow access" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1396068

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1394327 in qemu (Ubuntu Trusty) "unmapping of persistent grants in qemu" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1394327
