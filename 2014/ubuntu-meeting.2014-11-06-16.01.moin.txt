 16:05 <barry> (done)

 16:05 <doko> I'll go at the end ...

 16:05 <mvo> Short version to avoid being confused with people who write very long activity reports ;)

 16:05 <mvo> Worked on apt (new abi breaking release coming soon, prepare for some

 16:05 <mvo> turbulences), click, system-image, helped the SDK team and scopes

 16:05 <mvo> team, did merges. We have a i386/arm core image now :) But its still

 16:05 <mvo> too big :(

 16:05 <mvo> [full 61 lines gtimelog data available on request ;)]

 16:05 <mvo> (done)

 16:06 <cjwatson> I've been on vacation, and am on conference leave today and tomorrow at https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-UK/2014

 16:06 <mvo> nice!

 16:06 <cjwatson> (just happened to notice the highlight in this channel at the right time)

 16:06 <caribou> ok, i'm next

 16:07 <caribou> * BugFix : Ongoing work on libnss-ldap Critical bug LP: #1387594 - Merge waiting for sponsorship - Will then SRU

 16:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1387594 in libnss-ldap (Ubuntu) "init: symbol lookup error: /lib/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/libnss_ldap.so.2: undefined symbol: __libc_lock_lock" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1387594

 16:07 <caribou> (done)

 16:08 <robru> * citrain

 16:08 <robru> - fixed it to stop considering a merged merge as 'not Approved' (this makes it easier to do trunk releases using an already-merged merge)

 16:08 <robru> - simplified some redundant code

 16:08 <robru> - massive overhaul changing relative paths into absolute paths. not finished yet, but I *think* I fixed the bug where it cd's into the wrong dir and then creates a bunch of files and then can't find them later because they're not in the right place. using absolute paths ensures everything is where we expect it to be regardless of the cwd.

 16:08 <robru> * various and sundry landings as well

 16:08 <robru> (done)

 16:15 <mvo> bdmurray: not right now, let me look

 16:15 <bdmurray> during a P to T upgrade gnuplot-x11 and gnuplot-nox are kept, but then conflict on upgrade to Utopic
