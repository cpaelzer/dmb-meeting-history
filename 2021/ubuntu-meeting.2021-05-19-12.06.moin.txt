 12:06 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 12:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 12:06 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:06:55 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:06 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:07 <diddledan> thanks, Wild_Man :-)

 12:07 <diddledan> #chair diddledan

 12:07 <diddledan> .chair diddledan

 12:07 <diddledan> hmm

 12:07 <bittin> think Wild_Man need to add you as he started the meeting

 12:07 <diddledan> you'll have to do the honours I think

 12:08 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 12:08 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 12:08 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:08 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:08 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:14 <bittin> ogra: got to lazy to ssh into my shell and started irssi locally on my computer

 12:14 <ogra> ah

 12:14 <bittin> where i use my old nickname as login

 12:15 <bittin> so alternating a bit

 12:17 <bittin> have not collected any

 12:19 <diddledan> Luna, are you interacting with other members of the translations teams much, or are you working mostly on your own?

 12:19 <diddledan> same with the QA teams

 12:20 <bittin> have been talking a bit with GunnarHj and  Haaninjo and for QA i am in their Telegram group and IRC channel and have been talking a bit with jibel some years ago and with philipz and RikMills a bit recently

 12:28 <meetingology> Current voters: Wild_Man, bashing-om, diddledan

 12:28 <RikMills> I would say they perhaps need a bit more direction on that from experienced community people, as sometimes enthusiasm has meant things have posted that are not quite correct

 12:28 <RikMills> but I admit I probably did that in the early days

 12:29 <Wild_Man> Noted RikMills, thanks
