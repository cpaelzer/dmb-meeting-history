 12:38 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:38 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:38:23 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:38 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:38 <frenchguych> alright... let's fly !

 12:39 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 17th November 2021. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:39 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:39 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:39 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:39 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:39 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:39 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:39 <frenchguych> Hi !

 12:39 <diddledani> #topic Yannick Mauray

 12:40 <diddledani> #topic Yannick Mauray

 12:40 <diddledani> bot?

 12:40 <frenchguych> Timezone appropriate greetings, thanks everybody for your time.

 12:40 <Wild_Man> It is still a sleep

 12:40 <frenchguych> bot says no :P

 12:41 <diddledani> Yannick, could you introduce yourself to the board members and post the link to your wiki and/or discourse post.

 12:41 <frenchguych> Ok

 12:41 <Wild_Man> Hello frenchguych apologies I messed up the time change I guess

 12:41 <frenchguych> Wild_Man: no problem, that happens !!

 12:41 <frenchguych> So my LP link is https://launchpad.net/~yannick-mauray

 12:41 <frenchguych> Wiki link is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YannickMauray

 12:42 <frenchguych> and for what it's woth, discourse link to my application is https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/yannick-mauray-frenchguych-membership-application/24795

 12:42 <frenchguych> My name is Yannick Mauray, I'm 50-something (I stopped counting) years old, I am know as the french guy from Switzerland.

 12:42 <frenchguych> I am a member of the Ubuntu MATE team

 12:43 <frenchguych> where I'm in charge of re-writing the Software Boutique in Flutter

 12:43 <frenchguych> I also host a community stream on the Ubuntu On Air channel, every other week

 12:43 <frenchguych> I am a member of the snapcrafters team, although I'm not as active as I'd like to be there.

 12:43 <frenchguych> I published the "pogo" snap.

 12:44 <frenchguych> I have also contibuted the "jack1" interface to snapd a few month (year?) back

 12:44 <frenchguych> and, what I think I do best : I talk about Ubuntu a lot. Like, always :P

 12:46 <Bashing-om> frenchguych: You have indeed made good contributions, and certainly meet these criteras. On;y concern that I have is that you do afrim that you understand the Code of Conducr and pledge to abide  by the Code of Conduct for as long as they are a member.

 12:47 <diddledani> s/they/you/ ;-p

 12:48 <frenchguych> oh, is that on my wiki page ?

 12:49 <diddledani> frenchguych: bashing om is just asking a confirmation that you read and understood the coc when you signed it

 12:49 <frenchguych> well, I did sign the CoC in 2013 I think, and I think it is something anyone should abide by regardless of the fact it has been signed or not, and regardless of the community we're gravitating around.

 12:49 <frenchguych> ah, yes, yes I did read it

 12:50 <Wild_Man> I do not see where the Code of conduct has been signed on his wiki page, did I miss it

 12:50 <frenchguych> and yes, I do pledge to abide by the CoC for as long as I'll be a member, and even after that, should I cease to be a member one day

 12:50 <diddledani> Wild_Man: the CoC signing is indicate on launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~yannick-mauray

 12:51 <frenchguych> Wild_Man: it's on the LP page, and you are right, I forgot to mention it on the wiki page. I should fix that asap

 12:51 <Wild_Man> Your application looks good

 12:51 <diddledani> do any board members present have any questions they'd like to ask Yannick?

 12:51 <Wild_Man> I missed it, tired eyes
