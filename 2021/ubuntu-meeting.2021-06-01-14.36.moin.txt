 14:38 * sarnold gives his customary weekly ack to cpaelzer about backuppc

 14:38 <doko> sarnold, status of backupppc related security reviews?

 14:38 <sarnold> I don't remember seeing the libayatana-appindacator thing

 14:38 <sarnold> doko: not yet started

 14:39 <doko> ayatana looks incomplete, 2/3 packages done. maybe ping didrocks?

 14:39 <doko> jamespage, can you review the cherrypy related ones, or should we split these?

 14:40 <doko> mesa is still pending. I email didrocks two weeks ago. no reply yet

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I'm around - sorry

 14:41 <doko> ipmitool is oldish, but shows up in mismatches ... waiting on cpaelzer for that

 14:41 <cpaelzer> thanks for backuppc @sarnold

 14:42 <cpaelzer> IIRC ipmitool is from MAAS for MAAS

 14:42 <cpaelzer> and no one ever cared about it

 14:42 <cpaelzer> [Reverse-Depends: Ubuntu.Impish supported-maas seed]

 14:42 <cpaelzer> yes

 14:42 <doko> jamespage, fence-agents has been in main before. is it supposed to re-enter?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> fence-agents comes from us I guess doko

 14:42 <cpaelzer> as part of https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fence-agents/+bug/1927004

 14:42 <sarnold> yeah, we've had a discussion on the bug about the right names to use for the binary package that'll have agents we want to support

 14:42 <cpaelzer> waiting for security atm

 14:43 <doko> if we don't care about ipmitool, then maybe it should be seeded in the community-maas seed

 14:43 <doko> who can confirm this?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Adam I guess

 14:45 <cpaelzer> Collard

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I hope that wasn't misspelled ...

 14:45 <doko> I'll chase this with xnox

 14:45 <doko> I think he set these seeds initially

 14:46 <cpaelzer> freeipmi is in main, ipmitool and openimpi are not

 14:46 <cpaelzer> unfortunately HW manaufacturers seem to be unable to settle on one

 14:46 <sarnold> heh I didn't realize we had three of the things

 14:46 <cpaelzer> we might end up taking it in in additon to the one we have, but these changes

 14:47 <cpaelzer> seed changes I mean

 14:47 <cpaelzer> that it is worth to start with a clarification

 14:48 <sarnold> hmm, openimpi also looks to be in main

 14:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: oh your are right, agreed

 14:49 <cpaelzer> so maybe we really have to take the third one in to make it a charm :-)

 14:49 <sarnold> hah

 14:49 <sarnold> or is it 'operator' now..

 14:49 <cpaelzer> other than the expected fight of who will own this I see no problem

 14:49 <cpaelzer> and starting with xnox to calrify the intend doesn't sound like a bad start

 14:50 <cpaelzer> thanks doko for offering to chase this down

 14:52 <doko> I don't want to create actions for people not being present ... didn't work well last time

 14:52 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:52 <cpaelzer> FYI I have reviewed prips which came in yesterday

 14:53 <cpaelzer> and I have updated the status on a few to get them moving forward

 14:53 <cpaelzer> but nothing that would be a new team todo

 14:53 <doko> #topic New MIRs

 14:53 <cpaelzer> shall we look at th ebug lists now?

 14:53 <doko> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:54 <cpaelzer> That scary list is actually two

 14:54 <cpaelzer> let us start with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libftdi1/+bug/1912371

 14:54 <sarnold> oh hey and one of them is even good news :)

 14:54 <cpaelzer> doko: in the update between commend 8 and 9

 14:55 <cpaelzer> doko: did you have a look and acked it assinging it to security?

 14:55 <cpaelzer> that wasn't clear to me looking at the bug this morning

 14:55 <cpaelzer> if you have, then this is ready to go

 14:55 <cpaelzer> if it was a mistake then we need to assign someoen for a MIR review

 14:56 <cpaelzer> essentially William self-reviewed in commen 8 :-)

 14:56 <sarnold> what's the libftdi and libftdi1 change amurray made in comment 16?

 14:56 <cpaelzer> so your update could be seen as sign-off and Ack on that

 14:56 <doko> ok, I'll chase this down as well, probably just needs a seed

 14:56 <cpaelzer> sarnold: If I read correctly there is a debdiff that shall be appl√∂ied before promotion

 14:57 <doko> yep, the symbols file should be fixed

 14:58 <doko> I'll chase this down

 14:58 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:58 <cpaelzer> let us go to the bigger chunks of work now https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jaraco.classes/+bug/1930111

 14:58 <cpaelzer> 8 potentially easy python lib review tasks to assign

 14:58 <doko> yep, already asked before. should we split this, or load it on jamespage? ;)

 14:59 <cpaelzer> but the question upfront, who will own this?

 14:59 <cpaelzer> Is that from openstack?

 14:59 <doko> yes, openstack

 14:59 <cpaelzer> I'd say we assign him and he can call out to us if needed

 15:00 <cpaelzer> as he knows how this works even if he has no time to do it himself

 15:00 <cpaelzer> python3-cherrypy3                                         | cherrypy3                              | ceph-mgr                                          | Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>      |          228656 |            1181

 15:00 <cpaelzer> from germinate so yes indeed from openstack

 15:01 <cpaelzer> I've added an update and assigned jamespage to one of them

 15:01 <cpaelzer> now it shoudl be clear

 15:01 <cpaelzer> is that ok for everyone atm?

 15:02 <sarnold> I'm slightly skeptical the world needs yet another "high performance python webserver", it feels like one of the other existing webservers ought to work..

 15:02 <sarnold> but perhaps that's not one to solve at this meeting

 15:03 <cpaelzer> I agree

 15:03 <cpaelzer> to both

 15:07 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:07 <cpaelzer> next ...

 15:07 <doko> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:07 <doko> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:08 <sarnold> hmm, "new cherrypy3 18.6.0-1 release" .. we've got 8.9.1-8 packaged now.. this might be a big jump, heh

 15:08 <cpaelzer> or just a rename

 15:08 <cpaelzer> versions are smoke and mirrors

 15:08 <cpaelzer> I guess there is only https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ledmon/+bug/1794219 in this list to talk about

 15:09 <cpaelzer> doko: this one seems that sil2100 decided to help sorting that out

 15:09 <cpaelzer> doko: does tha answer we got from rex tsai satisfy that for foundations to go on?

 15:10 <doko> ok, I'll take this

 15:11 <cpaelzer> thanks ++

 15:11 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:11 <cpaelzer> not from me

 15:12 <sarnold> none from me

 15:12 <doko> ok, finished!

 15:12 <doko> #endmeeting
