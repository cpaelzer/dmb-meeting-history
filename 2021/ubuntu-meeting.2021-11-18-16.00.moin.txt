 16:18 * bdmurray hands sil2100 as sticky note

 16:19 <bdmurray> bug 1949205

 16:19 <ubottu> Bug 1949205 in initramfs-tools (Ubuntu) "Volume group 'vgubuntu' not found when parition encrypted in LUKS" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1949205

 16:20 <bdmurray> there's also bug 1949206 from the same reporter

 16:20 <juliank> this is working correclty

 16:20 <ubottu> Bug 1949206 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "parted_server: OUT: Error fsyncing/closing /dev/nvme0n1p1: Input/output error" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1949206

 16:20 <vorlon> seems to be complaining about the error message only

 16:21 <vorlon> and then the next line is fsck of /dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root, so it's clearly been found at boot

 16:21 <juliank> The error message appears because we try to access the LVM first, we don't know if it's lcoked

 16:21 <vorlon> low-priority

 16:21 <juliank> it's just confusing

 16:21 <juliank> it can't be fixed without breaking other use cases

 16:21 <vorlon> corrected the bug title

 16:21 <vorlon> we should untag this

 16:22 <bdmurray> that's 205 correct?

 16:22 <vorlon> yes

 16:23 <bdmurray> then the next one

 16:23 <bdmurray> Could it be a hardware issue?

 16:28 <bdmurray> we'll pass on that bug for now

 16:29 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:29 <bdmurray> vorlon:

 16:30 <vorlon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:31 <vorlon> a lot of packages here, no longer blocked by autopkgtest queues so these need looking at

 16:31 <vorlon> python-crypto, this is actually an obsolete package that the openstack team needs to drop their deps on so we can remove it

 16:31 <vorlon> so I don't think we should spend time fixing it

 16:32 <vorlon> dbus-python - slyon it looks like this is yours?

 16:32 <slyon> yes. the dbus-python tests are resolved, but I still need to get pyqt5 moving

 16:33 <vorlon> libcgi-pm-perl, libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl is xypron

 16:33 <vorlon> doesn't look like anyone had libidn from last time

 16:33 <vorlon> is a transition

 16:33 <vorlon> anyone want to take that one?

 16:34 <xypron> libgetopt-long-decriptive-perl: there is a bug in lintian. That is why I repackaged it. Waiting for sponsor.

 16:34 <vorlon> xypron: where is your package for sponsoring?

 16:35 <xypron> vorlon: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lintian/+bug/1950989 has the defdfiff

 16:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1950989 in lintian (Ubuntu) "lintian: failed autopkg tests" [Undecided, In Progress]

 16:36 <vorlon> xypron: thanks, I'll have a look at it today

 16:36 <xypron> vorlon: or ppa:xypron/merge-from-debian

 16:36 <vorlon> no one volunteering for libidn so I'll take a look at is as part of +1 maintenance

 16:36 <vorlon> libregexp-pattern-license-perl is juliank

 16:36 <vorlon> also libstring-copyright-perl

 16:36 <vorlon> and licensecheck

 16:37 <vorlon> waveform: are you still working on pillow?

 16:37 <juliank> did I (forget to) do that?

 16:37 <vorlon> I see pillow is blocked by an MIR

 16:37 <waveform> vorlon, yup -- MIR filed for raqm, and I've checked the other pkgs

 16:37 <vorlon> waveform: "checked" them? I still see failing autopkgtests that will block migration

 16:37 <waveform> (need to double-check ocrmypdf but the rest have -proposed updates already that should get things moving once the MIR clears)

 16:38 <vorlon> do those tests need rerun with --all-proposed?

 16:38 <vorlon> the MIR is orthogonal to the autopkgtest failures

 16:38 <waveform> ah, in that case probably yes

 16:39 <vorlon> triggering now

 16:39 <vorlon> psycopg2, no one took this last time?

 16:39 <vorlon> sil2100: do you want this one?

 16:39 <sil2100> hm, ok

 16:39 <jawn-smith> I could take it

 16:39 <vorlon> jawn-smith: psycopg2 then

 16:39 <sil2100> I'll take it

 16:39 <sil2100> ...or not!

 16:39 <sil2100> :>

 16:39 <vorlon> python-click was given to mwhudson, I guess?

 16:40 <bdmurray> we might not have actually told him though

 16:40 <vorlon> heh

 16:41 <vorlon> python-docutils is just waiting on sphinx which is blocked by pgrouting... I think there was something about pgrouting/ppc64el being a test failure we should ignore?

 16:41 <juliank> yes

 16:41 <vorlon> I'll follow that one up out-of-band

 16:42 <juliank> it gets puleld from proposed instead of release pocket due to bug somewhere in perl stuff

 16:42 <vorlon> ah right

 16:42 <juliank> see #-release backlog

 16:42 <vorlon> python-reportlab: sil2100: ?

 16:43 <vorlon> python-testtools: bdmurray?

 16:43 <bdmurray> okay

 16:43 <vorlon> pyyaml: ginggs?

 16:44 <ginggs> sure, i'll take it

 16:44 <vorlon> numpy - dbungert were you already working on this?

 16:45 <dbungert> vorlon: yes, it's just waiting at this point

 16:45 <dbungert> so I can take another

 16:45 <vorlon> ok

 16:45 <vorlon> tasksel should just need component-mismatch handling, I'll take it

 16:46 <vorlon> dbungert: do you want node-jquery? :)

 16:46 <dbungert> lol, OK

 16:46 <vorlon> schopin: can you take gobject-introspection?

 16:46 <schopin> OK

 16:46 <sil2100> vorlon: on  it!

 16:46 <vorlon> have I missed anyone?

 16:47 <bdmurray> I don't think so

 16:47 <vorlon> doko: do you want to take liburi-perl?

 16:48 <vorlon> sounds like a no

 16:48 <vorlon> back to bdmurray

 16:48 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:49 <bdmurray> We'd previously talked about doing a sponsoring party and I think we should do that tomorrow

 16:49 <bdmurray> I'll send some notes to our mailing list

 16:49 * juliank sponsored something today, but also needs to do some shim review stuff tomorrow

 16:50 <juliank> Gotta comment that people send back the right word lists :D

 16:50 <juliank> (thus, verifying their email addresses)

 16:50 <bdmurray> okay, thanks everybody

 16:51 <bdmurray> #endmeeting
