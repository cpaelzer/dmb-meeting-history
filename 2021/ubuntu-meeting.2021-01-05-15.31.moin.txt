 15:31 <cpaelzer> Happy new year

 15:31 <cpaelzer> it seems we have plenty of people and plenty of work back :-)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> Hi doko sarnold ddstreet didrocks jamespage

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:31 <cpaelzer> No old open actions to review

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> first the more silent one

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> nothing on there we didn't discuss before

 15:32 <cpaelzer> needrestart and dependencies now have a proper stub bug and will stay in that state until foundations finds time for it

 15:32 <sarnold> usrmerge?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> that is another case (we had one just prior to christmas)

 15:33 <cpaelzer> of users modifying state and thereby evading the triage process

 15:33 <cpaelzer> this is indeed new

 15:33 <cpaelzer> setting like that

 15:33 <doko> cpaelzer: needrestart is server seed?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> usermerge will come back at a later point this meeting and needs a reviewer

 15:34 <cpaelzer> doko: I've discussed with our managers and it is server-seed but foundations owned

 15:34 <doko> ok

 15:34 <cpaelzer> Mattthieu added a tag to it

 15:34 <cpaelzer> so it is tracked wherever he tracks things

 15:34 <cpaelzer> now propsoed, that is more busy

 15:35 <cpaelzer> or rather proposed

 15:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:35 <cpaelzer> backuppc is server Team

 15:35 <cpaelzer> it seems over the 2020/2021 change the new version got synced

 15:35 <cpaelzer> I'll do the processing of that this week

 15:35 <cpaelzer> let me create stubs and assign myself

 15:36 <doko> I'll look at liblist-moreutils-xs-perl

 15:36 <cpaelzer> cerated https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/backuppc-rsync/+bug/1910262

 15:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1910262 in libbackuppc-xs-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libbackuppc-xs-perl" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 15:36 <cpaelzer> thanks doko for that other perl module handling

 15:36 <cpaelzer> jamespage: has a lot of ongoing cases triggered by django and sqlalchemy

 15:37 <jamespage> o/

 15:37 <cpaelzer> jamespage: are thos all under control or is there any panic you need help with?

 15:37 <jamespage> hello

 15:37 <jamespage> lemme take a peek

 15:37 <cpaelzer> also the dependencies of python-cronier and octavia are openstack

 15:38 <cpaelzer> hence I'm saying there are quite a few

 15:38 <cpaelzer> other than that we have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+bug/1908502 which seems Dekstop just grabbed to prepare a MIR (or change the package)

 15:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1908502 in tiff (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libtiff5 dependency on libdeflate0" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 15:38 <cpaelzer> thanks doko for filing this one initially

 15:39 <cpaelzer> and we have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nftables/+bug/1887187

 15:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1887187 in nftables (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nftables" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 15:39 <doko> tiff got assigned only today

 15:39 <cpaelzer> which aits for security to say "yes we want it"

 15:39 <jamespage> I committed to work on the ones with MIR bugs raised - will do those this week

 15:39 <cpaelzer> sarnold: anything on nftables worth to mention, or should we skip on that until it gets an update some day?

 15:39 <jamespage> I'll ping icey and coreycb about the sqla-utils ones

 15:39 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage

 15:39 <sarnold> cpaelzer: skip, please. I'll raise it

 15:39 <sarnold> .. with the team

 15:39 <cpaelzer> ok

 15:40 <cpaelzer> ok, everything else I see is in some state of "in progress" or "waiting on something"

 15:40 <cpaelzer> anything else or can we go to the reviews that are to be assigned?

 15:41 <cpaelzer> ok that is a no :-)

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:41 <cpaelzer> here usrmerge comes back

 15:41 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usrmerge/+bug/1906671

 15:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1906671 in usrmerge (Ubuntu) "[MIR] usrmerge" [Undecided,New]

 15:41 <cpaelzer> and we have two tasks on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/opencc/+bug/1909665

 15:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1909665 in opencc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ibus-libpinyin dependencies" [Undecided,New]

 15:42 <cpaelzer> lua5.4 will be server (we own the other versions as well)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> I'd therefore volunter for lua review

 15:42 <cpaelzer> volunteers for opencc (Desktop - do you actually want it?)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> didrocks: ^^ ?

 15:42 <cpaelzer> and while that is discussed - who would be willing to look at usrmerge

 15:43 <didrocks> not familiar with it, but happy to give it a look

 15:43 <didrocks> (opencc)

 15:43 <doko> cpaelzer: I assume that would also mean to demote older lua versions ...

 15:43 <cpaelzer> doko: so far we have multiple supported already

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I'll need to tkae a deeper look what holds in which version

 15:43 <cpaelzer> take

 15:43 <doko> ta

 15:44 <cpaelzer> that leaves https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usrmerge/+bug/1906671 looking for a reviewer

 15:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1906671 in usrmerge (Ubuntu) "[MIR] usrmerge" [Undecided,New]

 15:44 <cpaelzer> since I got 1 review already and for backuppc two new filing+review already I'm withdrawing myself :-)

 15:44 <ddstreet> i can take usrmerge then

 15:44 <cpaelzer> we can't finish here until someone bits the usermerge-bullet

 15:44 <cpaelzer> \o/

 15:44 <didrocks> phew :)

 15:45 <cpaelzer> ok I assigned all of us that got reviews

 15:45 <cpaelzer> I'll hope that all these overload the security Team next week by being done fromt he MIR pov :-)

 15:45 <didrocks> heh

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:45 <cpaelzer> let us check if that matches the stubs we have seen in component mismatches

 15:45 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:46 <cpaelzer> needrestart and libtiff we just mentioned

 15:46 <cpaelzer> they are incomplet until work was done

 15:46 <cpaelzer> same for nftables

 15:46 <cpaelzer> rpi is in between - we talked about that a lot in the past

 15:46 <sarnold> I don't think I recall sizzle https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sizzle/+bug/1906514 but perhaps that's because there's nothing there yet

 15:46 <cpaelzer> waveform: new year new luck - could you look at finalizing https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/raspberrypi-userland/+bug/1895137/comments/14 ?

 15:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1906514 in node-jquery (Ubuntu Hirsute) "sizzle needs a MIR, or node-jquery needs dropping the recommends" [High,Confirmed]

 15:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1895137 in rpi-eeprom (Ubuntu) "[MIR] rpi-eeprom; raspberrypi-userland" [Undecided,In progress]

 15:47 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I remember the stub bug being opened by doko

 15:47 <cpaelzer> but it is gone from component mismatches

 15:47 <cpaelzer> was this maybe fixed?

 15:47 <cpaelzer> let us take a look at node-jquery and sizzle

 15:49 <cpaelzer> node-jquery | 3.5.1+dfsg+~3.5.5-5 | hirsute-proposed | source, all

 15:49 <cpaelzer> Recommends: libjs-sizzle (>= 2.3.5)

 15:49 <doko> the recommends is still there

 15:49 <cpaelzer> yep ^^

 15:50 <cpaelzer> hrm - so this still seems to be an issue

 15:50 <cpaelzer> why isn't it in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:50 <waveform> cpaelzer, will do

 15:50 <doko> that's now listed in Binary only movements to universe

 15:50 <doko> so I assume we can do that, and be done with it

 15:51 <sarnold> what's that? (the binary only movements to universe)

 15:51 <cpaelzer> sarnold: here https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html

 15:51 <cpaelzer> nothing holds node-jquery in main anymore

 15:51 <cpaelzer> that is why it isn't in mismatches

 15:51 <cpaelzer> we might quickly check what dep is gone

 15:51 <cpaelzer> but then I agree to doko

 15:52 <cpaelzer> uh

 15:52 <cpaelzer> I think there was a dedup of jquery code IIRC

 15:52 <cpaelzer> two packages into one

 15:52 <cpaelzer> that might explain why one of them can go away

 15:52 <cpaelzer> and with it the dependency it had

 15:53 <sarnold> cpaelzer: aha, thanks :)

 15:54 <cpaelzer> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/germinate-output/ubuntu.groovy/all+extra

 15:54 <cpaelzer> node-jquery was in for (at least) libjs-sphinxdoc

 15:55 <cpaelzer> hmm

 15:55 <cpaelzer> that seems still to be present in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/germinate-output/ubuntu.hirsute/all+extra

 15:55 <cpaelzer> doko: would you do the AA task of resolving that binary movement and do the checks if it is indeed correct to be moved?

 15:55 <doko> sure

 15:55 <cpaelzer> we don't have to stare at it with 6 people at the same time

 15:56 <cpaelzer> if it is odd to a level that is worth to discuss bring it back here next week

 15:56 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:56 <cpaelzer> mine: I hope you are all able to make 2021 an awesome year handling/ignoring all the world-drama

 15:56 <cpaelzer> any more important topic to discuss before we close?

 15:57 <sarnold> :)

 15:57 <didrocks> same for you cpaelzer :)

 15:57 <cpaelzer> ok, most of us have meetings on the top of the hour

 15:57 <cpaelzer> see you next week

 15:57 <cpaelzer> o/

 15:57 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
