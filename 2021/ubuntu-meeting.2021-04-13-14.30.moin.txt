 14:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:32 <cpaelzer> This looks mostly calm / like last week

 14:32 <cpaelzer> one case

 14:32 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-airscan/+bug/1891682

 14:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891682 in sane-airscan (Ubuntu) "[MIR] sane-airscan" [High,Fix committed]

 14:32 <cpaelzer> That was going on yesterday and today and it completed the last few steps to be ready

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I moved it into the state to be picked up by the archive admins to get promoted

 14:33 <didrocks> I can promote it

 14:33 <cpaelzer> doko: didrocks: one of you around to do that promotion maybe?

 14:33 <cpaelzer> awesome didrocks

 14:33 <cpaelzer> you also did the review back then so you are aware of the case

 14:33 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:33 <didrocks> yep :)

 14:33 <didrocks> yw

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I see nothing else in mismatches that needs our attention (all known cases and known false-positives)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:33 <cpaelzer> none

 14:34 <cpaelzer> again rather easy (as it is in this time of the cycle)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Nothing new since 2021-03-16

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:34 <cpaelzer> luna: you asked if there is a meeting, so I guess you have something?

 14:35 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:35 <luna> nope i just saw that you had this meeting in #ubuntu-desktop and feelt like following along :p

 14:35 <sarnold> hehe :)

 14:35 <luna> don't have anything to add

 14:35 <cpaelzer> oh well, if you want to see more chaos here then I recommend joining the weeks after 21.10 auto-sync was enabled :-)

 14:35 <didrocks> :)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> anyone else ?

 14:36 <luna> heh when is that sometime after the 21.04 release?

 14:36 <sarnold> yeah I think it's usually about a week later

 14:36 <didrocks> nothing for me

 14:36 <luna> ah alright cool sarnold cpaelzer will try to join then :)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ok, then that was another easy one - never the less (or even more) I appreciate all who had the time to attend

 14:37 <cpaelzer> closing the meeting for today ...

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Since we drained the queue enough to really only have the new incoming cases it feels mcuh better here :-)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
