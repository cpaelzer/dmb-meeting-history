 14:32 <cpaelzer> one really new entry in there being screen-resolution-extra -> policykit-1-gnome

 14:32 <cpaelzer> that sounds like desktop - didrocks999 could you have a look at that?

 14:32 <didrocks999> hey

 14:32 <didrocks999> sure, will do

 14:32 <cpaelzer> thanks - all other entries in there we had last week already

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:32 <doko> o/

 14:32 <cpaelzer> sdl isn#t new

 14:32 <cpaelzer> that is ready

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I'll update th ebug

 14:33 <cpaelzer> glad to ahve you around doko

 14:33 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libftdi1/+bug/1912371 waits for you

 14:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1912371 in libftdi1 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] flashrom + libftdi" [Undecided, New]

 14:33 <cpaelzer> from the bug history it was abit unclear what happened

 14:34 <cpaelzer> it seemed to be a self-review by a non MIR member and you then acked it

 14:34 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libftdi1/+bug/1912371/comments/8

 14:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1912371 in libftdi1 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] flashrom + libftdi" [Undecided, New]

 14:34 <cpaelzer> +

 14:34 <cpaelzer> your update after it

 14:34 <cpaelzer> if that was meant to be your sign-off on that - then this case is ready

 14:35 <cpaelzer> otherwise whatever is missing in your opinion needs to be done

 14:35 <cpaelzer> so doko could you have a look after this one

 14:35 <cpaelzer> I'd hope that it really is ready and could then be promoted

 14:35 <sarnold> good morning

 14:36 <cpaelzer> hi sarnold

 14:37 <sarnold> hey cpaelzer :)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> doko: could you please confirm to resolve this ftdi case ?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> the next in this list we need to talk about is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flatpak/+bug/1812456

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1812456 in flatpak (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libflatpak0" [Medium, New]

 14:37 <cpaelzer> that is a bit older and now is back in "new" state

 14:37 <doko> no, having a hangout with william tomorrow

 14:38 <cpaelzer> doko: and do you think you can sort it out in that hangout and then update the bug accordingly ?

 14:38 <didrocks999> I think itâ€™s a conversation with security on flatpak?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> didrocks999: flatpack you reviewed

 14:38 <cpaelzer> then sarnold did in #13

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok; "provisional ACK" I see

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I'd consider this an incomplete until resolved didrocks999 - do you agree

 14:39 <cpaelzer> and once these things are sorted out it would then be ready as it has both Ack's already

 14:39 <didrocks999> yeah, I would feel better if sarnold can read/answer #14

 14:39 <didrocks999> and incomplete until then

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok - I've set it incomplete for now

 14:41 <cpaelzer> that is all on the NEW list

 14:41 <cpaelzer> doko: please let me know if you want someome else to tackle libftdi, but since you have history with the case and the people you would be the most efficient one to get this into the right next states

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:42 <cpaelzer> golan* thins we had last week

 14:42 <cpaelzer> sdl and flatpack I have just now set to incomplete

 14:42 <cpaelzer> so we do not have real new entries here

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
