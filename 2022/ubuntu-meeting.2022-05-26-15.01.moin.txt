 15:02 <jawn-smith> Let's all take some time to read through it and ask questions

 15:02 <bdmurray> ginggs: Can we remove the r-bioc-biomart hint now?

 15:03 <ginggs> bdmurray: yes, it can go now

 15:03 <bdmurray> okay, I'll remove it

 15:03 <ginggs> thanks

 15:04 <bdmurray> waveform: your upgrade bug was a kernel issue?

 15:05 <waveform> bdmurray, yup

 15:06 <bdmurray> No further questions meeting leader

 15:07 <jawn-smith> Given that slyon tagged this let's go ahead and card it

 15:08 <jawn-smith> bug 1937110

 15:08 <ubottu> Bug 1937110 in busybox (Ubuntu) "dhcp option 121 & 249" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1937110

 15:09 <jawn-smith> dbungert: do you think this is worth carding?

 15:09 <jawn-smith> you tagged it rls-kk

 15:09 <dbungert> jawn-smith: yea, I thought so

 15:10 <bdmurray> This seems to be blocking installs on some networks so I think we should take and it try to fix it by 22.04.1

 15:10 <jawn-smith> mclemenceau: care to do your lp-to-jira magic?

 15:10 <mclemenceau> yes no prob

 15:10 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:11 <bdmurray> still no response so let's close it out

 15:12 <jawn-smith> likely a duplicate, so we'll close it

 15:12 <jawn-smith> bug 1973285

 15:12 <ubottu> Bug 1973285 in raspberrypi-userland (Ubuntu) "libraspberrypi0 multi-arch install failing due to lintian override content difference" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1973285

 15:13 <jawn-smith> waveform is working on it, so let's card it

 15:13 <jawn-smith> bug 1975667

 15:13 <ubottu> Bug 1975667 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd-resolved does not reset DNS server and search domain list properly after VPN disconnect" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1975667

 15:15 <jawn-smith> per discussion we've decided to SRU to jammy, which requires a card

 15:15 <jawn-smith> That's it for jj

 15:15 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ii-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:15 <jawn-smith> bug 1975667 has just been discussed

 15:15 <ubottu> Bug 1975667 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd-resolved does not reset DNS server and search domain list properly after VPN disconnect" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1975667

 15:16 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: you tagged this

 15:16 <bdmurray> Yeah, this is something we should sort out before impish goes EoL

 15:16 <jawn-smith> Okay, let's card it then

 15:16 <jawn-smith> thanks

 15:17 <bdmurray> Otherwise those people will be stranded on a gorilla island

 15:17 <jawn-smith> that's it for ii

 15:17 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:17 <jawn-smith> bug 1975678 has been carded already

 15:17 <ubottu> Bug 1975678 in netplan.io (Ubuntu Kinetic) "Netplan generates the wrong YAML value when setting activation-mode=off" [Low, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1975678

 15:18 * jawn-smith looks at the Debian bug report

 15:19 <bdmurray> I looked at the debian bug but it actually seems different

 15:19 <bdmurray> notice the word "similar" in the description

 15:19 <jawn-smith> ah I see

 15:19 <bdmurray> Having said that unmount before finished sounded bad

 15:20 <jawn-smith> Well, sounds pretty serious

 15:20 <jawn-smith> Should we set an Importance and then card it?

 15:20 <bdmurray> I'll set it to High

 15:20 <jawn-smith> bdmurray: thanks

 15:20 <bdmurray> Maybe somebody should look to see if it is fixed in > Focal

 15:21 <bdmurray> I'll volunteer

 15:21 <jawn-smith> Awesome, thanks bdmurray

 15:21 <jawn-smith> That's it for bugs then

 15:21 <jawn-smith> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:21 <jawn-smith> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:22 <jawn-smith> libevent vs mysql on i386

 15:22 <jawn-smith> seems to have been waveform

 15:22 <jawn-smith> it looks like a badpkg issue

 15:22 <jawn-smith> Have you investigated the badpkg to see if it will ever come back on i386?

 15:22 <waveform> no not yet

 15:23 <jawn-smith> Okay, that's still with waveform then

 15:23 <jawn-smith> dash

 15:23 <jawn-smith> there was some discussion last week about adding the debian-archive-keyring

 15:23 <jawn-smith> doko: dash was assigned to you, have you investigated the keyring solution?

 15:24 <doko> no, not yet. I'll keep it

 15:24 <jawn-smith> doko: thanks!

 15:24 <jawn-smith> alright licensecheck's MIR is with schopin who is out today, skipping

 15:24 <jawn-smith> doko: is pillow still with you as well?

 15:24 <doko> yes

 15:25 <jawn-smith> ginggs: are you working on the sphinx/libunicode-escape-perl MIR/dependency issue?

 15:25 <ginggs> no, i believe schopin is looking with that along with some other perl MIRs

 15:25 <jawn-smith> Okay great, thanks

 15:26 <jawn-smith> libgpg-error is with slyon who is out

 15:26 <jawn-smith> pycurl is with ogayot who is out

 15:26 <doko> gdb just migrated

 15:26 <jawn-smith> oh, I pressed F5 and gdb is suddenly a candidate. Nice

 15:27 <jawn-smith> mutt needs a dependency investigation

 15:27 <jawn-smith> which was not assigned last week

 15:27 <doko> and/or a MIR

 15:28 <jawn-smith> correct, I just don't want to blindly suggest MIRs without ensuring they're needed

 15:28 <jawn-smith> I'll investigate mutt vs libgsasl7 and do the MIR if necessary

 15:28 <jawn-smith> Haven't done one in a while

 15:28 <doko> * Replace cyrus-sasl with gsasl (Closes: #999672)

 15:28 <jawn-smith> rustc missing builds sounds like a schopin issue

 15:29 <jawn-smith> doko: thanks, will definitely look into that

 15:29 <jawn-smith> curl vs dgit I'm pretty sure just needs a retry, but I'll wait for the migration-reference test to finish first

 15:29 <doko> riscv64 only (rustc)

 15:30 <jawn-smith> curl vs pycurl. Any volunteers?

 15:30 <ginggs> i'll take it

 15:30 <jawn-smith> Thanks ginggs

 15:30 <jawn-smith> ginggs: ogayot may be working related issues per enr0n

 15:31 <ginggs> noted

 15:31 <jawn-smith> xz-utils vs linux-lowlatency has succeeded. Thanks again ginggs

 15:31 <jawn-smith> libcloud vs paramiko

 15:31 <enr0n> I can take that

 15:31 <jawn-smith> enr0n: thanks!

 15:32 <jawn-smith> dnspython has regressions on each arch so likely a real issue

 15:32 <jawn-smith> dbungert: dnspython?

 15:33 <jawn-smith> adduser is another badpkg issue on i386

 15:33 <jawn-smith> anyone want to look into that?

 15:34 <bdmurray> I'll have a look

 15:34 <jawn-smith> Thanks bdmurray

 15:34 <jawn-smith> I believe the requests MIR is with xypron and/or ogayot

 15:34 <jawn-smith> and that's the whole list

 15:35 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 15:35 <jawn-smith> Lots of people having long weekends. Monday is a US holiday and many Europeans are off today and tomorrow

 15:36 <jawn-smith> Anything else?

 15:37 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
