 14:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:30:33 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:30 <cpaelzer> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage

 14:30 <cpaelzer> hello everyone

 14:30 <joalif> o/

 14:30 <cpaelzer> FYI didrocks has a conflict but will read backlog later

 14:31 <cpaelzer> so we will assign almost everything to him *evilgrin*

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> the lintian explosion is starting to be covered by stubs and approved MIRs

 14:31 <slyon> nothing new as far as I can tell

 14:31 <cpaelzer> isoburn and co are ongoing and covered

 14:32 <slyon> I created lintian stubs. those approved (old) MIRs are probably useless and should be unassigned

 14:32 <cpaelzer> yep, nothing new from my POV either

 14:32 <slyon> I had one questrion wrt false positives.

 14:32 <slyon> but maybe we can discuss this during AOB

 14:32 <cpaelzer> shoot

 14:32 <cpaelzer> ah ok

 14:32 <cpaelzer> then AOB

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:33 <slyon> plzip & lzlib are my false positives to be discussed later

 14:33 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:33 <cpaelzer> then https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libisofs/+bug/1977959

 14:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1977959 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libisoburn, libburn, libisofs" [Undecided, New]

 14:33 <cpaelzer> this was reviewed by diddledani

 14:33 <cpaelzer> sorry

 14:33 <cpaelzer> didrocks:

 14:33 <slyon> libisoburn, libburn, libisofs is for didrocks to have a look at. I think everything is resolved and this should be a MIR team ACK

 14:33 <diddledani> damn, I thought I was useful then!

 14:33 <cpaelzer> yes slyon I also think this is a re-evaluation if all required todos are covered

 14:34 <slyon> ACK

 14:34 <cpaelzer> do I hear that you will do that re-check slyon?

 14:34 <sarnold> diddledani :)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> and keeping plzip for AOB discussion ...

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:34 <slyon> it's all good IMO, but I wanted to leave it for didrocks as he did the initial review and I don't want to override his decision

 14:34 <slyon> should be quick, though

 14:35 <cpaelzer> ok, then we consider it pre-checked and didrocks gets the task to check if he agrees

 14:35 <cpaelzer> if yes, then assign seucrity or mark it as approved for the archive admins

 14:35 <cpaelzer> going to incomplete cases then

 14:35 <cpaelzer> two recent updates

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ipmitool entered seucrity queue

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I have an update there that we have automated tests which we think we can add

 14:36 <cpaelzer> was only recommended, but still more tests = better

 14:36 <slyon> lintian is just a MIR stub & update-excuse bug for now

 14:36 <cpaelzer> there is an ipmi simulator which can be used for some

 14:36 <cpaelzer> and ack on lintian*

 14:36 <cpaelzer> TL;DR nothing to act or assign here

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:36 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:37 <cpaelzer> sarnold: has anything left the queue in the last week?

 14:37 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I believe only telegraf -- it's hard to call that a win, but it's one fewer in the queue..

 14:37 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:38 <cpaelzer> sarnold: in terms of non-progress - at what date do you want me to make the same noisy call to security management that got jammy reviews fixed last minute?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> given that many have 7 weeks left (scheduled for feature freeze)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> I think it is time that I ask this ... sorry

 14:40 <cpaelzer> or do you expect you can get your new helping hands that you mentioned in the past to help you to get some of these cases done soon?

 14:40 <sarnold> cpaelzer: probably about two weeks -- we're doing onboarding for two new team members last week and this week, the holiday weekend is in the past :(, so it should be a bit of a slow return to work..

 14:40 <sarnold> cpaelzer: it is reassuring to see the 'in progress' cards on jira :)

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok, let us then consider - if in two weeks we still see none cleared I'll take the sad job of ringing bells wherever I can

 14:40 <sarnold> thanks :D

 14:41 <cpaelzer> with the current load I can skip the internal queue

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we get to ...

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:41 <slyon> wrt the lintian component-mismatch, plzip & lzlib seem to be false positives, as described here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lzlib/+bug/1980663

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980663 in plzip (Ubuntu) "[MIR] plzip & lzlib" [Undecided, New]

 14:41 <cpaelzer> slyon: let us talk about https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lzlib/+bug/1980663

 14:42 <cpaelzer> ack slyon, that is the most common type of false-positive that I know of

 14:42 <slyon> I was wondering if we should somehow track those false positives, e.g. by keeping that bug open (in NEW state) and adopt the title to something like "[MIR]... FALSE-POSITIVE" ?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> so you can set that bug to "invalid"

 14:42 <cpaelzer> oh I see

 14:42 <cpaelzer> you mean to get them "non-white"

 14:42 <cpaelzer> We could even consider using just ONE bug and add bug tasks

 14:42 <slyon> that way we would not need to remember the false-positives ourselves, but would have a reference from the generated SVG

 14:42 <slyon> yes that way my idea

 14:43 <cpaelzer> the only problem would be "what if it ever is a real dependency" but we have that problem already as we ignore some

 14:43 <sarnold> oh I really like this "use one bug over and over" idea

 14:43 <cpaelzer> unless it gets way too many tasks launchpad is ok with that

 14:43 <cpaelzer> slyon: how about this, you can set plzip to the state/content you'd like for this

 14:43 <cpaelzer> next week we check component mismatches and how it looks

 14:43 <cpaelzer> if it "feels right" then we add all the other known cases

 14:44 <cpaelzer> would that work for all of us?

 14:44 <sarnold> how many would we have? it feels like we have a dozen of these, and launchpad is unhappy at the kernel's four dozen-ish tasks..

 14:44 <cpaelzer> sarnold: I've found that until ~25 things are ok

 14:44 <sarnold> dang that's lower than I thought

 14:44 <slyon> the problem with a single bug is that we cannot have the analyis per case in the description/content

 14:44 <sarnold> if we make a new bug every tenpackages, though, that's still a big step up

 14:44 <cpaelzer> hmm, that is true slyon

 14:44 <cpaelzer> oh well

 14:44 <slyon> if we keep it as-is, it would describe why it's a false positive. and if it would pop up as a real dependency that could be checked

 14:45 <cpaelzer> we could have the description just have an explanation of why we have false positives

 14:45 <cpaelzer> and every PKG added can be a new comment outlining the reason

 14:45 <slyon> that might be a nice solution.

 14:45 <cpaelzer> how about trying this for the zip cases then

 14:45 <slyon> let me set it up like this, and we can think about it for a bit

 14:45 <slyon> then make a call next week

 14:46 <cpaelzer> exactly

 14:46 <cpaelzer> slyon: if you are in the mood you can also immediately add the other known cases, up to you(r available time)

 14:46 <slyon> sure

 14:46 <cpaelzer> which would be like xterm, esmtp IIRC

 14:47 <cpaelzer> ok next topic

 14:47 <cpaelzer> we have successfully moved to GH with our rules

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I thought it is worth to document that here as well

 14:47 <cpaelzer> it has a TOC still (top left button) and sub-anchor links work

 14:47 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir#mir-team-weekly-status-meeting

 14:48 <slyon> nice work, thank you!

 14:48 <sarnold> nice :D

 14:48 <cpaelzer> and using that - as you have sen in your mail I have created a renewed PR for rust

 14:48 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/1

 14:48 <ubottu> Pull 1 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Add rust v3" [Open]

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I'm obviously in +1 to my own proposal

 14:48 <cpaelzer> slyon: reviewed and is ok as well

 14:48 <cpaelzer> didrocks: reviewed just before and +1 (I'll add his small feedback in a bit)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> I guess we definetly want sarnold/security to +1 and otherwise just need a majority

 14:49 <cpaelzer> if I might ask joalif / sarnold / jamespage to review that?

 14:49 <joalif> looking

 14:49 <cpaelzer> I liked the comment of slyon as that really was as I see it quoting: "I feel like this should be landed soon to have a base to build upon. It can still be improved/adopted later on, once we processed some initial Rust packages."

 14:50 <cpaelzer> and server team has a case ready for review (including cargo.lock) once we approved the rules

 14:51 <cpaelzer> so TL;DR for now - please review this, once we have more +1 I'd merge it and we will then throw the mdevctl MIR into the ring to try it out

 14:51 <sarnold> did the package need to go to some effort to copy the cargo.lock into the built package?

 14:52 <cpaelzer> sarnold: without the tooling in place we had to essentially create the .lock file ourselves

 14:52 <cpaelzer> sarnold: we have documented that in README.source as our preliminary rules ask for

 14:53 <cpaelzer> dh-cargo strips upstreams .lock files and avoids creating new ones, so until implemented there some kind of maintainer-created .lock is the only way to reasonably go

 14:53 <cpaelzer> it is not that we write it line by line, there is a command which generates it just fine

 14:54 <joalif> +1

 14:55 <cpaelzer> thanks joalif - just throw that +1 as approval on the PR along any feedback if you have some

 14:55 <cpaelzer> so the task to read in detail is left for sarnold

 14:56 <cpaelzer> and for jamespage is you want (but so far openstack != rust) so you might rightfully not care much

 14:56 <cpaelzer> and by that I'd call this meeting closed

 14:56 <cpaelzer> any last important things to share?

 14:56 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 14:56 <slyon> nothing, thanks cpaelzer, all!

 14:56 <cpaelzer> ok then - see you next week and happy reviewing

 14:56 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
