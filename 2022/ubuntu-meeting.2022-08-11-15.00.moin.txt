 15:00 <jawn-smith> #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team

 15:00 <meetingology> Meeting started at 15:00:47 UTC.  The chair is jawn-smith.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 15:00 <dbungert> o/

 15:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 15:01 <jawn-smith> The status is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/foundations-team-updates-thursday-11-august-2022/29970

 15:01 <jawn-smith> Let's all take our usual few minutes to read and ask questions

 15:02 <bdmurray> can somebody give me the tldr on bug 1983859?

 15:02 <ubottu> Bug 1983859 in tracker-miners (Ubuntu Focal) "tracker-extract crashes with SIGSYS when upgrading from 20.04 to 22.04" [High, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1983859

 15:03 <bdrung> bdmurray, TLDR: tracker-extract crashes during upgrade from 20.04 to 22.04 (due to updated libraries)

 15:03 <schopin> bdmurray: during upgrade, glibc is upgraded before tracker-extract, seccomp is unhappy with new fstatat64 syscall

 15:04 <schopin> Fix is to update seccomp filter in the focal tracker-extract.

 15:05 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll review that today

 15:05 <schopin> sil2100: ^ (since you were planning on it as well)

 15:05 <bdmurray> It'll be a race then

 15:07 <jawn-smith> Any other questions?

 15:08 <jawn-smith> dbungert: I'll try to keep bug 1984134 in mind

 15:08 <ubottu> Bug 1984134 in hddemux (Ubuntu) "FTBFS on ppc64el" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1984134

 15:08 <dbungert> jawn-smith: appreciate it, no particular rush

 15:09 <jawn-smith> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:09 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-kk-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:09 <jawn-smith> bug 1981109

 15:09 <ubottu> Bug 1981109 in modemmanager (Ubuntu) "server image pulls in ModemManager via fwupd, consumes 25MiB RAM in every container" [High, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981109

 15:09 <jawn-smith> Is this still with desktop? Still nothing for foundations to do?

 15:10 <bdmurray> afaik

 15:10 <jawn-smith> Okay, moving on then

 15:10 <jawn-smith> bug 1981721

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1981721 in netplan.io (Ubuntu) "dual port SRIOV NIC with 64 VFs per PF  is not configured with switchdev eswitch mode" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1981721

 15:10 <jawn-smith> slyon: is this still waiting for openstack input?

 15:10 <slyon> yes. no updates since last time

 15:10 <jawn-smith> Okay moving on then

 15:10 <jawn-smith> bug 1983719

 15:10 <ubottu> Bug 1983719 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Improve message for missing ESP on BIOS systems" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1983719

 15:12 <jawn-smith> juliank: you tagged this. Is further discussion needed to determine the fix?

 15:12 <juliank> Wording needs to be agreed upon

 15:13 <jawn-smith> Should that happen in the LP bug?

 15:14 <juliank> probably but we can card it now :)

 15:14 <jawn-smith> Okay sounds good, thanks

 15:14 <jawn-smith> That's it for kk

 15:14 <jawn-smith> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 15:14 <jawn-smith> bug 1984171

 15:14 <ubottu> Bug 1984171 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "ubiquity removed package that was installed; is needed later; is known to exist remotely; without network" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1984171

 15:15 <bdmurray> so that was worked around for 22.04.1 but still needs proper sorting

 15:15 <jawn-smith> This is the late-night discussion from yesterday right?

 15:16 <juliank> yeah

 15:16 <bdmurray> I think it was Tuesday

 15:16 <jawn-smith> Okay, sounds worth carding for sure

 15:16 <schopin> it spanned multiple days :)

 15:16 <bdmurray> And scheduling for 22.10

 15:16 <juliank> it's also not really clean to solve I think

 15:17 <juliank> The package needs removing normally, unless you install nvidia...

 15:17 <jawn-smith> slyon: do you mind carding this as well? And targeting to jj and kk?

 15:17 <slyon> jawn-smith: will do!

 15:17 <jawn-smith> Thanks!

 15:17 <jawn-smith> bug 1920584

 15:17 <ubottu> Bug 1920584 in nvidia-graphics-drivers-450 (Ubuntu) "package nvidia-dkms-450 450.102.04-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 failed to install/upgrade: installed nvidia-dkms-450 package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 10" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1920584

 15:17 <jawn-smith> ah, wrong bug number

 15:17 <jawn-smith> ignore that

 15:17 <jawn-smith> bug 1820584

 15:17 <ubottu> Bug 1820584 in avahi (Ubuntu) "seahorse assert failure: seahorse: glib-watch.c:195: timeout_update: Assertion `!t->dead' failed." [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1820584

 15:19 <jawn-smith> Tens of thousands of crash reports sounds important

 15:19 <jawn-smith> and it's marked high, so let's card it

 15:19 <slyon> ack

 15:19 <jawn-smith> Thanks! The last bug is the netplan.io issue that's already been discussed and is waiting on openstack

 15:19 <jawn-smith> rls-ff is empty \o/

 15:20 <jawn-smith> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:20 <jawn-smith> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:20 <jawn-smith> ubuntu-meta is with desktop

 15:20 <jawn-smith> lintian and mutt are waiting on MIRs

 15:21 <jawn-smith> zlib was with ogayot

 15:21 <ogayot> libbio-samtools-perl is just waiting for a no-change rebuild

 15:21 <slyon> zlib currently blocked on this build to start (and pass) eventually: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samtools-legacy/0.1.19+dfsg-5ubuntu1/+build/24268457

 15:21 <ogayot> python3.11 is new, I haven't looked at it yet

 15:21 <schopin> ogayot: you have a sponsor for this no-change rebuild?

 15:22 <slyon> schopin: I wanted to do that, after above mentioned build is ready

 15:22 <ogayot> slyon but I think he's off tomorrow so maybe I'll need your help :)

 15:22 <slyon> but I'll be out tomorrow, so feel free to pick it up

 15:22 <schopin> Sure :)

 15:23 <ogayot> and linux-lowlatency is investigated by Frank, I think he has a patch ready.

 15:23 <jawn-smith> Okay great, thanks for looking into that ogayot and slyon and schopin

 15:23 <jawn-smith> gcc-12-cross and gcc-defaults are still blocked by the LP issues

 15:24 <jawn-smith> libgd-perl seems to have been with v_orlon

 15:24 <jawn-smith> So I'll assume it's still with him for now

 15:25 <jawn-smith> libuv1 was with enr0n

 15:25 <enr0n> Yeah, I have spent some time looking into it, but no solutions yet.

 15:25 <jawn-smith> Alright I'll leave that with you then

 15:26 <jawn-smith> cryptsetup doesn't seem to have been assigned last week.

 15:26 <slyon> schopin: remember that we should run `update-maintainer` on the no-change rebuild debdiff that ogayot provided in bug #1983255

 15:26 <ubottu> Bug 1983255 in samtools-legacy (Ubuntu Jammy) "samtools-legacy misses 'Remove compressBound assertions' (PR #1258) fix" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1983255

 15:26 <bdrung> cryptsetup is only blocked by a flaky systemd autopkgtest

 15:26 <jawn-smith> Ah ginggs had triggered a migration/reference/0 test

 15:27 <jawn-smith> and it failed, so that's going to be resolved

 15:27 <slyon> ack

 15:27 <jawn-smith> Is anyone looking into that flakiness?

 15:27 <dbungert> there is a card

 15:27 <jawn-smith> neat

 15:27 <enr0n> jawn-smith: yeah, Lukas and I discussed probably disabling the offending test again

 15:27 <jawn-smith> Sounds like a plan to me

 15:27 <jawn-smith> casper is with me

 15:28 <slyon> enr0n: yes I think that makes sense, and we should include it into the next upload

 15:28 <enr0n> slyon: ack

 15:28 <jawn-smith> from my investigations it appears to just be flakiness

 15:28 <jawn-smith> Thanks ginggs for triggering migration-reference tests for casper

 15:29 <jawn-smith> Alright debootstrap

 15:30 <schopin> it's migration-reference/0 failed

 15:30 <jawn-smith> Ah so nothing to do

 15:30 <jawn-smith> Everything else is 0 days old

 15:31 <jawn-smith> #topic AOB

 15:31 <schopin> bug 1868517

 15:31 <ubottu> Bug 1868517 in rust-xml-rs (Ubuntu Focal) "Stray /usr/.crates2.json file" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1868517

 15:31 <schopin> There's a bunch of packages that just need rebuild SRUs in focal

 15:31 <sil2100> "Stray" I heard is a decent game

 15:33 <bdmurray> The armhf autopkgtest workers are all down right now but I'll sort it out soon

 15:37 <jawn-smith> Monday is a holiday in most of Europe I think

 15:37 <sil2100> I'll be out Mon, Tue and Wed o/

 15:37 <enr0n> I have not requested it yet, but I am going to try and get Monday off last minute

 15:40 <jawn-smith> #endmeeting
