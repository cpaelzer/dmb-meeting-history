 16:13 <bdmurray> bug 1961979

 16:13 <ubottu> Bug 1961979 in paramiko (Ubuntu) "Can't connect to Jammy hosts (openssh >= 8.8p1-1)" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1961979

 16:13 <bdmurray> Oh, that is our package

 16:14 <bdmurray> This is causing an issue with auto iso testing so let's target and card that

 16:14 <mclemenceau> Ok

 16:14 <bdmurray> I'll check with paride though to see if they are working on it.

 16:15 <bdmurray> bug 1958720

 16:15 <ubottu> Bug 1958720 in pyyaml (Ubuntu) "python3-yaml and python3-six are not co-installable with python-is-python2 in jammy" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1958720

 16:15 <bdmurray> let's skip that

 16:15 <bdmurray> bug 1962038

 16:15 <ubottu> Bug 1962038 in systemd (Ubuntu) "wrong sysrq value in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf" [High, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962038

 16:15 <slyon> I investigated this today, 2 settings are being shadowed by systemd. It should be an easy fix, so should be carded and targeted to Jammy & Impish

 16:16 <bdmurray> okay

 16:16 <mclemenceau> Ok carded

 16:16 <bdmurray> bug 1767054

 16:16 <ubottu> Bug 1767054 in subiquity (Ubuntu) "suggest default keyboard based on language" [Low, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1767054

 16:16 <paride> bdmurray, on the paramiko bug: I'm looking for a workaround for the ISO tests, but not a packaging a new upstream version at the moment.

 16:16 <dbungert> I talked to Seb about this keyboard item

 16:17 <dbungert> It doesn't have to be picked up for Jammy timeframe but I'd like to get it high on the list along with another keybord item for the next cycle

 16:17 <bdmurray> paride: got it, foundations will look at a new upstream then

 16:18 <bdmurray> okay, we can tag it rls-kk then

 16:18 <dbungert> bdmurray: thanks

 16:18 <bdmurray> ubug 1961432

 16:18 <bdmurray> bug 1961432

 16:18 <ubottu> Bug 1961432 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Upgrading from 21.10 to 22.04 fails to upgrade snap core18" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1961432

 16:19 <bdmurray> This seems worth investigating the json might need updating

 16:19 <bdmurray> so let's target and card

 16:20 <bdmurray> tasksel I want to look at next week

 16:20 <bdmurray> bug 1961185

 16:20 <ubottu> Bug 1961185 in linux-firmware-raspi (Ubuntu) "package linux-firmware-raspi 6-0ubuntu2 failed to install/upgrade: new linux-firmware-raspi package pre-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 2" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1961185

 16:20 <bdmurray> is this the one jawn-smith tested?

 16:20 <jawn-smith> yes

 16:21 <jawn-smith> There is a fix to that issue in a waveform owned PPA, but it needs other changes to addres another issue

 16:21 <jawn-smith> so not quite ready for sponsoring

 16:21 <bdmurray> okay, let's target and card it

 16:21 <jawn-smith> The other bug is bug 1962001

 16:21 <ubottu> Bug 1962001 in linux-firmware-raspi (Ubuntu) "Add diversions for raspi firmware files shipped in bluez-firmware package" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962001

 16:21 <bdmurray> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ii-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:22 <bdmurray> bug 1959085

 16:22 <ubottu> Bug 1959085 in zfs-linux (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu 21.10 boot stuck in initramfs" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1959085

 16:22 <bdmurray> xnox can you look at that?

 16:22 <bdmurray> #link https://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 16:22 <bdmurray> the boot partition sizing is being discussed

 16:22 <jawn-smith> That looks like it could possibly be the dirname issue in busybox again

 16:23 <bdmurray> jawn-smith: the zfs one?

 16:23 <vorlon> in 21.10?

 16:23 <jawn-smith> I'm reading it more closely and think I'm wrong

 16:23 <bdmurray> Okay, moving on then there is bug 1961697

 16:23 <ubottu> Bug 1961697 in glibc (Ubuntu) "Transaction ID collisions cause slow DNS lookups in getaddrinfo" [Medium, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1961697

 16:24 <bdmurray> Let's talk to mwhudson about that since there is another upload of glibc coming for focal

 16:24 <bdmurray> alright, that's it for bugs

 16:25 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:25 <vorlon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:25 <vorlon> looks like we have quite a few here

 16:25 <vorlon> the first couple (libselinux libsemanage) are blocked on ruby, which is the Server Team's

 16:26 <vorlon> cross-toolchain-base shows test regressions on arm64 still

 16:26 <doko> c-t-b is on me, retrying autopkg tests

 16:26 <vorlon> thanks

 16:26 <vorlon> that's one of two issues still blocking python3-defaults

 16:26 <vorlon> is someone looking at python-pip?

 16:26 <doko> yes, I assume that's also on me

 16:27 <vorlon> ok

 16:27 <vorlon> then various things which are waiting on the python3 transition

 16:27 <vorlon> libwww-perl, is that just entangled with perl itself?

 16:28 <vorlon> no, it has an autopkgtest regression, not shown in the report

 16:28 <ginggs> that looks like it's waiting on a migration-reference test that probably got lost

 16:28 <ginggs> i'll retrigger it

 16:29 <vorlon> ginggs: thanks

 16:29 <vorlon> (and ah yes, that's a state the report doesn't know how to parse, noted)

 16:29 <vorlon> perl: has some autopkgtest regressions, but LP: #1962050 is filed for removing those, that's in progress with me

 16:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1962050 in libobject-pad-slotattr-trigger-perl (Ubuntu) "libobject-pad-slotattr-X-perl: Object::Pad::SlotAttr::X is replaced by Object::Pad::FieldAttr::X" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1962050

 16:29 <vorlon> also waiting on an i386 autopkgtest, I'll sort out what's needed there

 16:30 <vorlon> then more things depending on perl

 16:30 <vorlon> and libdbi-perl blocked by a regressing mariadb autopkgtest

 16:30 <vorlon> xypron: can you look at libdbi-perl please?

 16:30 <xypron> vorlon: I will add it to my backlog

 16:30 <vorlon> scanning past lots and lots of perl packages that are waiting to go in together...

 16:31 <vorlon> libre-engine-re2-perl isn't built. enr0n can you look at this?

 16:31 <enr0n> yes

 16:31 <vorlon> boost1.74 appears to still needs some love

 16:31 <vorlon> bdmurray: can you look at this?

 16:32 <bdmurray> okay

 16:32 <vorlon> glibc vs linux-meta-raspi - juliank ?

 16:32 <vorlon> juliank: and systemd vs linux-meta-raspi as well, please

 16:32 <vorlon> pygments - ginggs ?

 16:33 <doko> no, boost just waits on python3-defaults

 16:33 <bdmurray> libre-engine-re2-perl is not migrating because its missing an i386 build

 16:33 <ginggs> sure, i'll take pygments

 16:33 <vorlon> doko: the report output suggests boost needs to migrate with some other packages not all of which are ready.  anyway, bdmurray can make that determination

 16:33 <vorlon> google-osconfig-agent - dbungert ?

 16:33 <dbungert> vorlon: ack

 16:34 <vorlon> and then that's all the packages older than 2 days

 16:34 <vorlon> so a few of you lucked out

 16:34 <vorlon> bdmurray:

 16:34 <jawn-smith> dbungert: let me know if you want any help with google-osconfig-agent since I lucked out

 16:34 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 16:34 <dbungert> jawn-smith: thanks, I'll keep that in mind

 16:34 <sil2100> 20.04.4 coming later today, hopefully

 16:37 <vorlon> \o/

 16:37 <bdmurray> okay, thanks everybody
