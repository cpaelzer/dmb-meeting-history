 16:26 <waveform> nothing for us here

 16:27 <waveform> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:27 <waveform> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:28 <jawn-smith> o/

 16:28 <waveform> handing over to jawn-smith

 16:28 <jawn-smith> python-crypto: did someone have that one?

 16:28 <schopin> should be removed from the archive, I think doko was handling it.

 16:29 <schopin> lintian is mine, my MIR just got feedback with minor things to check.

 16:29 <jawn-smith> okay, libselinux

 16:30 <slyon> it's systemd related, so I'll take it

 16:30 <jawn-smith> That seems to be systemd related

 16:30 <jawn-smith> excellent, thanks

 16:30 <jawn-smith> libsemanage depends on ruby-defaults, which is a server team package

 16:30 <jawn-smith> skipping

 16:31 <jawn-smith> autofs seems to also be server based on discussion last week

 16:31 <jawn-smith> alexghiti: what's the status on pygments?

 16:31 <alexghiti> Waiting for debian feedbacks as I bumped the version of the package

 16:32 <slyon> there is an excuse bug that doesn't show up in the report: #1956440 (i just added the pygments package to that bug to make it show up in the future)

 16:33 <jawn-smith> okay, looks like ogayot was working on an MIR for libstring-copyright-perl

 16:33 <ogayot> yes LP: #1956444

 16:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1956444 in libset-intspan-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libset-intspan-perl" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1956444

 16:33 <jawn-smith> excellent, thanks

 16:33 <jawn-smith> openssh depends on openssl so should migrate soon

 16:33 <jawn-smith> great job schopin

 16:33 <schopin> \o/

 16:34 <jawn-smith> python-click seems to have been mwhudson

 16:34 <jawn-smith> curl looks messy, should we hand out all these failures amongst the team to investigate?

 16:34 <dbungert> think so

 16:35 <jawn-smith> cryfs: who wants it?

 16:35 <jawn-smith> waveform will be taking cryfs and freedombox

 16:35 <waveform> I can take the cryfs and freedombox ones (arm specific)

 16:35 <jawn-smith> any takers on kopanocore?

 16:36 <dbungert> sure

 16:36 <jawn-smith> waveform to investigate libreoffice (probably a timeout)

 16:37 <jawn-smith> mediawiki probably also a timeout. Lots of armhf issues that are likely related to infra issues lately

 16:37 <jawn-smith> those can just be retried and addressed again next week if they still exist

 16:37 <jawn-smith> systemd: slyon?

 16:37 <slyon> ack

 16:37 <jawn-smith> I'll take devscripts

 16:38 <jawn-smith> plenty of dpkg failures to hand out

 16:38 <jawn-smith> As mentioned I'll investigate devscripts

 16:38 <jawn-smith> who doesn't have one and wants to take asymptote?

 16:39 <alexghiti> o/

 16:39 <jawn-smith> thanks, how about dh-make-perl?

 16:39 <alexghiti> ack

 16:39 <jawn-smith> who loves perl? That may just need a reclick

 16:39 <ogayot> I can check dh-make-perl

 16:39 <jawn-smith> okay, simde?

 16:39 <ginggs> i'll take it

 16:40 <jawn-smith> looking at sqlite3

 16:40 <jawn-smith> dgit may just need a reclick as well

 16:40 <dbungert> sqlite3 is still mine, I just need to beg for sponsors

 16:41 <dbungert> I believe dgit just needs another retest, yes

 16:41 <jawn-smith> to clarify, alexghiti will take asymptote and ogayot will take dh-make-perl

 16:41 <jawn-smith> I'll retest dgit

 16:41 <dbungert> thanks

 16:41 <jawn-smith> binutils is glibc so I'm assuming mwhudson

 16:41 <slyon> dnsmasq vs systemd o/ (LP: #1957086)

 16:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1957086 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Autopkgtest systemd fail against dnsmasq 2.86 (22.04)" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1957086

 16:42 <schopin> dbungert: if some of your sponsoring needs are in universe feel free to ping me

 16:43 <jawn-smith> I think that's all of them then. Back to you waveform

 16:43 <waveform> #topic AOB

 16:43 <jawn-smith> Monday is a US holiday

 16:43 <dbungert> schopin: thanks, I will confirm that and get back to you

 16:46 <dbungert> schopin: yes, they are both in universe.  LP: #1956796 LP: #1956798

 16:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1956796 in ruby-sqlite3 (Ubuntu) "FTBFS against sqlite3 3.37 or newer" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1956796

 16:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1956798 in restfuldb (Ubuntu) "FTBFS against sqlite3 3.37 or newer" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1956798

 16:46 <juliank> I'm out tomorrow

 16:46 <schopin> dbungert: I'll take a look :)

 16:47 <waveform> okay, thanks everyone
