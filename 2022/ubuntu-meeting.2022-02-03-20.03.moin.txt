 20:03 <diddledani> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 20:03 <meetingology> Meeting started at 20:03:28 UTC.  The chair is diddledani.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 20:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 20:03 <diddledani> here comes the big paste intro

 20:03 <diddledani> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 3rd February 2022. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:03 <diddledani> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:03 <diddledani> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:03 <diddledani> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:03 <diddledani> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:03 <diddledani> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 20:03 <diddledani> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 20:04 <diddledani> jchittum: could you please introduce yourself to the board members and share the links to your wiki and launchpad pages and discourse post if you filed one

 20:04 <jchittum> Yes, first off discourse: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/john-chittum-jchittum-j5awry-membership-application/26347

 20:04 <jchittum> launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~jchittum

 20:06 <diddledani> thanks, do you have a prepared statement?

 20:06 <jchittum> Hello all! I'm John Chittum. I'm an engineering manager on the Canonical Public Cloud team. I've been an Ubuntu user for years, professionally since about 2014. I've been a jack of all trades, working as a sys admin for Ubuntu systems, to a sys eng installing and maintaining wide geo-distributed servers, to a web deb, and finally on the CPC team. I hang with the local LUG group (Kansas City)

 20:07 <jchittum> my open source work for Ubuntu has primarily been in livecd-rootfs, but i've also done some work on cloud-init recently.

 20:07 <jchittum> my big goal is to make how we build Ubuntu cloud images more transparent to everyone, and make the process easier for the community

 20:09 <diddledani> awesome. I'll let the board members have a few minutes to read through your discourse post and then we'll see if anyone has any questions

 20:09 <Wild_Man> jchittum, impressive work and testimonials

 20:11 <jchittum> Wild_Man: TY. I've had the privilege of working with a lot of fantastic Ubuntu members

 20:12 <diddledani> first question from me, more a formality to dot the tees and cross the eyes; you've signed the code of conduct, did you and do you understand the terms it contains and do you agree to abide by them for the duration of your membership?

 20:12 <jchittum> Yes, I understand the terms and agree to abide by them

 20:12 <diddledani> awesome :-)

 20:12 <diddledani> that's the script done with then. open floor for questions time :-D

 20:13 <diddledani> do any board members wish to ask a question or two?

 20:14 <Wild_Man> I do not

 20:14 <Bashing-om> no questions from me - I have encountered jchittum's works a number of times always positive in nature.

 20:14 <diddledani> thought as much ;-) we have a very strong candidate :-D

 20:15 <diddledani> ok, in that case then, let's speed along to the vote (wait till I've filed the two commands)

Your @ubuntu.com email will go live within 48 hours (don't set it as your launchpad's primary email as that will cause loops)
