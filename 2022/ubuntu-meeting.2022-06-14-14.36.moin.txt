 14:37 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:37 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:37 <cpaelzer> only known false positives in non-proposed

 14:37 <slyon> nothing new AFAICT

 14:37 <cpaelzer> the other view gets bigger but the majority has ongoing cases

 14:38 <cpaelzer> nothing "new" indeed, but jaraco will stay that way and we wait for openstack to pick it up

 14:38 <cpaelzer> jamespage: coreycb: ^^

 14:38 <cpaelzer> IIRC we have plenty in the new queue, so let us go on

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:39 <cpaelzer> iso/burn is a return to main

 14:39 <cpaelzer> so that is three, but could be easier than usual

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ipmitool and python-charset are from server - normal cases I'd say

 14:39 <cpaelzer> and jigit is for usbcreator

 14:39 <cpaelzer> how about trying to review others cases

 14:39 <joalif> i can take ipmitool one

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I could take jigit

 14:40 <slyon> i can take python-charset-normalizer

 14:40 <cpaelzer> which would leave the "three but return to MIR" for didrocks

 14:40 <didrocks> I guess the 2 returning ones are for me then :)

 14:40 <didrocks> well, 3

 14:40 <cpaelzer> ok let me assign that way

 14:41 <cpaelzer> done

 14:41 <cpaelzer> incoming unassigned list now empty

 14:41 <cpaelzer> BTW thank you all, we assigne dfew last week and the majroity is done already

 14:41 <sarnold> \o/

 14:41 <cpaelzer> it is really helpful for the project overall that we keep these quick turnaround times

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:42 <didrocks> yeah, especially when seeing the speed things are piling back up :)

 14:42 <cpaelzer> mdevctl is the rust switch

 14:42 <cpaelzer> no news for us there

 14:42 <cpaelzer> athos is about to start on it

 14:43 <cpaelzer> gsasl update was a review by didrocks

 14:43 <cpaelzer> lib*-perl update might be for us

 14:43 <cpaelzer> reading

 14:44 <slyon> yes. I think the licensecheck MIRs are ready and can be promoted. sphinx deps still need some work

 14:45 <cpaelzer> libxs-parse-sublike-perl seems to be ok now (tests fixed)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I understand that schopin says that this escape pattern isn't in other places

 14:46 <cpaelzer> hte problem is they are still rather unmaintained and old

 14:46 <schopin> o/

 14:46 <cpaelzer> hiho

 14:46 <cpaelzer> we are trying to decode the next steps for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libunicode-string-perl/+bug/1972853

 14:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1972853 in libunicode-string-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] lib*-perl" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 14:47 <schopin> The only semi-viable alternative would be to wrap the string to decode in "" and parse it as JSON.

 14:47 <schopin> But then we'd have to hope that there isn't a stray " in there.

 14:47 <cpaelzer> so you (=Foundations) would really like to subscribe and own these old code then?

 14:47 <cpaelzer> is that the alternative you prefer

 14:47 <schopin> Honestly? No.

 14:47 <cpaelzer> so what do you prefer then?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> There was nothing else that was a huge show-stopper

 14:48 <cpaelzer> if you (= the team) really want to own based on your explanation for being a "special escaping" you'll get my ok

 14:48 <schopin> To be clear I was speaking as myself, I'm not sure of the position of the team. I think I'll need to talk to the Debian maintainer to see what they think about the JSON parsing.

 14:49 <cpaelzer> yeah

 14:49 <slyon> we can also tag it rls-kk-incoming, to talk about it with the team.

 14:49 <cpaelzer> how about you get back on the bug once you have clarified with Debian maintainer and did e.g. bring it up in your team meeting for a decision

 14:49 <cpaelzer> the TL;DR is I'm not blocking you on it, but would recommend this to be a known "yes we want it" decision

 14:50 <cpaelzer> for the reasons outlined in the review

 14:50 <schopin> makes sense, will do both and keep the bug up to date.

 14:50 <cpaelzer> \o/

 14:50 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:50 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:50 <cpaelzer> Internal link

 14:50 <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 14:50 <cpaelzer> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:51 <slyon> But IMO we should already be good to promote libindirect-perl libobject-pad-perl libxs-parse-sublike-perl and unblock the licensecheck MIR, do we?

 14:51 <cpaelzer> The list keeps growing sarnold :-)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> does the workforce to resolve them still grow as well?

 14:51 <cpaelzer> slyon:  yes we should be ok on those

 14:51 <sarnold> aye, faster than it shrinks, let us hope this is temporary :) ruby-webrick was finished in the last week; ell, telegraf, and vulkan-tools are in progress

 14:52 <cpaelzer> ok, that sounds better than half a year ago

 14:52 <cpaelzer> let us take this as a plus

 14:52 <cpaelzer> the second link is for all of you

 14:52 <cpaelzer> only works internally (sorry)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> but allows you to prioritize your cases among each other

 14:52 <cpaelzer> as we did long ago with Trello

 14:52 <cpaelzer> while you might stare at that let me go to

 14:52 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:53 <cpaelzer> nothing from me that wasn't already covered

 14:53 <didrocks> thx for the board! This will help :)

 14:53 <sarnold> nothing from me

 14:53 <didrocks> nothing from me otherwise

 14:53 <slyon> nothing

 14:54 <joalif> nothing

 14:54 <cpaelzer> nice

 14:54 <cpaelzer> breathe for 5 min and then the next emeting will surely start :-)

 14:54 <cpaelzer> see you all

 14:54 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
