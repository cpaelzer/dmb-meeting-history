 14:32 <slyon> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <slyon> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:32 <slyon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:32 <slyon> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <slyon> nothing new on -release

 14:34 <slyon> on -proposed we have libisofs->jigit, which had some discussion today in #ubuntu-release, but I'll bring that up during AOB

 14:34 <sarnold> -proposed has a mess of lintian, python->redis brings in python-deprecated,. python-async-timeout, python-typing-extensions

 14:34 <sarnold> liburi-perl -> libregexp-ipv6-perl

 14:34 <slyon> python-redis seems new. It's ubuntu-openstack, so probably for jamespage to have a look at

 14:35 <slyon> the lintian mess is all assigned with the Foundations team

 14:35 <slyon> liburi-perl seems Foundation'ish, so I'll investigate that

 14:35 <slyon> the others seem to be known

 14:36 <sarnold> and hooray for the tracking bug for the known false positives :)

 14:36 <slyon> I'd also like to talk about false-positives (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plzip/+bug/1980663) e.g. plzip, lzlib, xterm ... but we can do this during AOB, too, when cpaelzer is available as well.

 14:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980663 in xterm (Ubuntu) "[MIR] false-positives, do not promote" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 14:36 <jamespage> o/

 14:36 <jamespage> apologies for being a little late

 14:37 <slyon> hey jamespage! could you have a look at the new python-redis depends/mismatches on https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg?

 14:37 <jamespage> looking now

 14:37 <slyon> thanks. Moving on

 14:37 <slyon> #topic New MIRs

 14:37 <slyon> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:37 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:37 <slyon> we only have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/protobuf-c/+bug/1956617

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1956617 in protobuf-c (Ubuntu) "[MIR] protobuf-c" [Undecided, New]

 14:38 <sarnold> I think that's just a simple matter of the statuses being set incorrectly

 14:38 <slyon> We got the security team ACK. but we need to sync from debian

 14:38 <slyon> sarnold: is it? there was some recent activity

 14:39 <sarnold> slyon: yeah, eslerm acked it, but only unassigned us when done, not change the status to In Progress

 14:40 <sarnold> I changed it to In Progress just now so we'll probably see it again in a few minutes :)

 14:40 <slyon> sarnold: right. I think this is actually done (MIR ACK & security ACK), but we'd want to sync/merge from debian before promoting it, right?

 14:40 <slyon> thanks

 14:40 <slyon> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:40 <slyon> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:40 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:40 <sarnold> there was a good debate about the security fix and whether or not it actually made sense, etc, so pulling in from debian *soon* would give us a lot more confidence for the release

 14:42 <slyon> I guess I can do the protobuf-c merge and set to "Fix Committed" afterwards..

 14:42 <slyon> as I've been involved in resolving the original MIR requirements

 14:42 <sarnold> excellent, thanks

 14:42 <slyon> so for incomplete MIRs, we have: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libregexp-wildcards-perl/+bug/1980968

 14:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980968 in libregexp-wildcards-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libregexp-wildcards-perl" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 14:43 <slyon> oh that's a dummy. Foundations tracking it wrt lintian mismatch

 14:43 <slyon> same with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libhtml-tokeparser-simple-perl/+bug/1980662 (assigend to Graham)

 14:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980662 in libwww-mechanize-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] lib*-perl for lintian 2.115" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 14:43 <sarnold> "Moved libregexp-wildcards-perl into a separate MIR since it's maintained by a different group" aha!

 14:43 <sarnold> and that question answered :)

 14:44 <slyon> that leaves us with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdevctl/+bug/1942394

 14:44 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1942394 in mdevctl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] mdevctl 1.0.0 (rust switch)" [Undecided, Incomplete]

 14:44 <sarnold> I can't quickly spot what changed in the description recently..

 14:44 <sarnold> aha, TODOs are changed, eg " The package runs a test suite on build time, if it fails it makes the build fail"

 14:45 <slyon> I think this is related to the rust ruleset changes and for cpaelzer to comment on

 14:45 <slyon> IIRC mdevctl was the first rust package

 14:45 <sarnold> yeah

 14:46 <slyon> it seems to be actively worked on (last change 5 min ago), so I'd just let it sit there for now and move to AOB, to discuss the rust changes

 14:46 <slyon> ah wait. security update first :)

 14:46 <sarnold> it's probably the same discussion anyway :)

 14:46 <slyon> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:46 <slyon> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:46 <slyon> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:46 <slyon> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 14:47 <sarnold> ah right! protobuf-c is finished yesterday \o/

 14:47 <slyon> sarnold: do you have any news for us? We saw some progress on protobuf-c :)

 14:48 <slyon> sarnold: have you been able to onboard a few more security reviewers?

 14:48 <sarnold> other MIRs are in progress, which is good; even with the help of the newer folks, we are getting worried about burning down the entire list of MIRs to finish, so we'd like to encourage / recommend teams to please set priorities in jira, it really does help us when we're assigning tasks

 14:49 <slyon> do the priorities in jira somehow relate to the milestones we set in launchpad?

 14:49 <sarnold> slyon: let's say sporadic progress, promising, but a reminder that we can't expect the same throughput from newer folks than our friends who'd found greener pastures, etc..

 14:49 <sarnold> through a manual process :(

 14:49 <slyon> understandably.

 14:49 <sarnold> and when there's risk of not getting all the tasks done in a milestone, it's nice to know which ones the requesting teams would like us to pick first

 14:50 <slyon> so is this something the security team is doing (setting priorities) or are teams expected to set priorities in LP and jira?

 14:50 <sarnold> those are inputs from other teams

 14:50 <sarnold> (fwiw I don't think LP priorities are considered at all)

 14:50 <slyon> okay. Maybe let's repeat that next week. as this week's MIR meeting seems a bit short staffed :)

 14:51 <sarnold> will do

 14:51 <slyon> thanks!

 14:51 <slyon> #topic Any other business?

 14:51 * sarnold pokes cpaelzer

 14:51 <slyon> maybe let's start with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plzip/+bug/1980663

 14:51 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1980663 in xterm (Ubuntu) "[MIR] false-positives, do not promote" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 14:51 <sarnold> that's lovely

 14:52 <sarnold> good job with the explanations

 14:52 <slyon> I created this bug to track some false-positive component-mismatches. what do you thinkg about having such a ticket? (And do you feel the "Fix Released" status is appropriate?

 14:52 <slyon> the idea is to add a bug task + description in the comments for every false-positive package

 14:52 <sarnold> it is a bit weird that it shows up bright yellow in the svgs, but the legend seems to suggest that's a very low-stress place for them to be, so it kind of feels like it fits

 14:52 <slyon> this way they would show up as yellow on the component-mismatch list and are clickable to read the explanation

 14:53 <cpaelzer> fully back - reading backlog

 14:54 <slyon> sarnold: ACK. I felt the "yellow" fix-released status to be the least actionable, that's why i chose it

 14:54 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:54 <cpaelzer> thanks slyon for the false-positive handling

 14:54 <cpaelzer> the good thing on approved/yellow state is that it is more obvious that those are different

 14:54 <cpaelzer> so I like it

 14:54 <slyon> I couldn't come up with a proper analysis for esmtp (and others) so if somebody knows their story, feel free to add a bug task abou tit

 14:55 <cpaelzer> esmtp was also an alternative

 14:56 <cpaelzer> wow this is older that the move to libera

 14:56 <slyon> cpaelzer: could you add that in a comment?

 14:56 <cpaelzer> need the other log for esmtp

 14:56 <slyon> ok

 14:56 <slyon> On a different note, there was some discussion today on #ubuntu-release about https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-creator/+bug/1978066

 14:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1978066 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jigit" [Undecided, Confirmed]

 14:57 <cpaelzer> slyon: that is the reason for esmtp https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/germinate/+bug/1895011

 14:57 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1895011 in germinate (Ubuntu) "virtual-packages do not pick a seeded package (ordering dependent)" [Undecided, New]

 14:57 <slyon> looks like libisofs https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libisoburn/+bug/1977959 was set to "Fix Committed" (and promoted) too early, which caused Desktop ISOs build failures

 14:57 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1977959 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libisoburn, libburn, libisofs" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 14:58 <cpaelzer> hmm that is an issue slyon

 14:58 <cpaelzer> how did that happen?

 14:58 <slyon> src:libisofs has a required TODO: "- In addition of this MIR for the 3 packages, ensure that jigit MIR is also acked (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jigit/+bug/1978066)." which is not yet resolved. So I guess its status should be set to "In Progress" right?

 14:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1978066 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jigit" [Undecided, Confirmed]

 14:58 <cpaelzer> yesa indeed

 14:59 <slyon> we rolled back the change for now (moved usb-creator to -proposed) and set a "block-proposed" tag on LP to avoid this issue for now

 14:59 <cpaelzer> it is a miss by didrocks (who isn't here to defend) when re-checking the case

 14:59 <cpaelzer> rolling it back was right IMHO

 14:59 <slyon> OK I'll update the status

 14:59 <cpaelzer> we might want/need to update th ebug

 14:59 <cpaelzer> ok thanks

 14:59 <cpaelzer> using the last few seconds .. (time flies)

 14:59 <cpaelzer> about the rust rules

 15:00 <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/1

 15:00 <ubottu> Pull 1 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Add rust v3" [Open]

 15:00 <cpaelzer> the question comes down to

 15:00 <cpaelzer> a) land rules now - modify later OR hold changes back until all is ready

 15:00 <cpaelzer> and

 15:00 <cpaelzer> b) do we allow packages in main before things like cargo.lock or else are ready OR not

 15:01 <cpaelzer> a and b can be decided independently

 15:01 <cpaelzer> and the time here runs out

 15:01 <cpaelzer> there is also a discussion about if the new static-built-using is helpful and would replace go.mod/sum and cargo.lock or not

 15:01 <cpaelzer> since time runs out all I can ask is to participate on the PR discussion

 15:01 <cpaelzer> sorry

 15:02 <sarnold> iirc static-built-using reports only source retrieved from other binary packages; and the cargo.lock reports also vendored-in sources

 15:02 <cpaelzer> and next week is planning sprint - so most likely hard to attend for even more of us

 15:02 <sarnold> should we skip it? or is it that much more important?

 15:03 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold - I also expected it to cover only packages

 15:03 <slyon> I'm all for merging the rust rules, soon. As landing smaller changes/adoptions in the future (wrt cargo.lock/static-built-using) should be much easier

 15:03 <cpaelzer> so it really comes down to ask foundations if they would be willing to pick up generating a cargo.lock in dh-cargo

 15:03 <sarnold> hmm; related to the jigit/iso-creator .. should we have a step "add block-proposed to a bug if there are outstanding TODO"?

 15:03 <cpaelzer> I'll ask mclemenceau about that

 15:03 <cpaelzer> but for landing the current text I'm also preferring to land it soon

 15:04 <slyon> thanks cpaelzer. It would probably be for Simon, who's on vacation currently

 15:04 <cpaelzer> sarnold: what if I change the rules for rust to require the cargo.lock (that we can't have yet)

 15:04 <cpaelzer> sarnold: can we then merge them

 15:04 <cpaelzer> sarnold: and later revise?

 15:04 <sarnold> cpaelzer: that would make me feel vastly better, yes

 15:04 <cpaelzer> ok, I#ll ping you once updated

 15:04 <sarnold> cpaelzer: so long as point (b) remains ..

 15:04 <sarnold> thank you thank you :)

 15:05 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 15:05 <cpaelzer> I'm on a run again :-/

 15:05 <cpaelzer> thanks for leading slyon

 15:05 <sarnold> thanks slyon, cpaelzer, jamespage :)

 15:05 <slyon> sounds good! let's merge the rules with requiring cargo.lock and discuss the cargo.lock + static-built-using situation further as the next step

 15:05 <slyon> thanks all!
