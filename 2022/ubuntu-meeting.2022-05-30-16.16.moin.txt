 16:16 <sil2100> #startmeeting Developer Membership Board

 16:16 <meetingology> Meeting started at 16:16:28 UTC.  The chair is sil2100.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 16:16 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:17 <sil2100> One proposition I had: what would everyone think of moving the format a little bit, so that we handle applicants at the beginning of a meeting?

 16:17 <sil2100> I suppose we should have a formal discussion/vote about that first, right?

 16:17 <rbasak> I think that's fine, and you're the chair so you get to decide.

 16:17 <sil2100> Since I'm always worried that the applicants have to wait until we're done with all the review items etc. unnecessarily

 16:18 <rbasak> Maybe just ensure that there aren't any previous action items holding up applicants.

 16:18 <sil2100> True

 16:18 <rbasak> On the principle of giving applicants priority, strong +1 :)

 16:18 <bdmurray> +1 from me too

 16:18 <sil2100> Ok, I think we're good from this POV, let's try that then

 16:18 <sil2100> #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications

 16:19 <sil2100> #subtopic Simon Chopin

 16:19 <sil2100> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/simon-chopin-core-dev-application/28291

 16:19 <sil2100> schopin: o/

 16:19 <schopin> o/

 16:19 <sil2100> schopin: hello! Can you introduce yourself briefly?

 16:20 <schopin> Hi! I am Simon Chopin, I'm a French software developer within the Foundations team of Canonical.

 16:21 <sil2100> Questions?

 16:21 <bdmurray> Could you elaborate on how you could do better with attention to detail?

 16:23 <sil2100> schopin: ^ ?

 16:24 <schopin> I oftentimes do small mistakes such as targetting the wrong series when uploading. Since I know this, it shouldn't happen, and yet...

 16:25 <bdmurray> schopin: Do you have any plans for avoiding small mistakes in the future?

 16:25 <rbasak> I'm not sure if you're done, but I have a couple of questions when you're ready.

 16:26 <rbasak> Oh sorry, I'll wait

 16:28 <schopin> bdmurray: besides looking into why dch -r targets my current series and not devel by default, I think I need to take the time to develop some "rituals"/checklists, and also some more wrappers.

 16:29 <bdmurray> Okay, thanks. Go ahead rbask

 16:29 <rbasak> Could you tell me about feature freeze please? How do you determine if a freeze is active? If feature freeze is active, then how do you decide if feature freeze would apply to a package for example for an upstream version moving from 1.2~rc2 to 1.2? And if you need an exception, how do you request one?

 16:34 <schopin> After a few months of "open" development of the devel series, the archive enters Feature Freeze, during which autosync with Debian is disabled. To see when that happens I'd go to the release schedule on Discourse, or check the topic in #ubuntu-devel. We can upload to the archive if to fix bugs. New upstream releases are usually not uploaded, except if they are purely bugfix releases, which

 16:34 <schopin> I'd expect in 1.2~rc2 to 1.2. If I need an exception, I'll open a FFe bug against the package, attaching the debdiff that I want to upload, and subscribe the release team.

 16:36 <schopin> rbasak: ^

 16:36 <rbasak> How would you decide if something is a purely bugfix release or not?

 16:39 <schopin> I'll have a look at upstream's changelog and commit history. If they don't have the former and the latter is inexploitable, I'll probably err on the side of caution and not upload unless I know and trust upstream (which is unlikely if they don't have those two elements)

 16:39 <schopin> It helps if they have an explicit release policy.

 16:41 <schopin> Sometimes it's hard to decide if it's a bugfix or a feature, in which case I'll ask on #ubuntu-release

 16:41 <rbasak> OK thanks. One more question from me please. How would you check if an upload will trigger a component mismatch?

 16:43 <schopin> I'm making this one up so this might be wrong, but I guess I could somehow run germinate? Previously I did it manually but I missed the rustc/llvm-13/z3 chain, so...

 16:45 <rbasak> OK thanks. I have no further questions

 16:45 <sil2100> No questions from me

 16:45 <sil2100> kanashiro: questions?

 16:45 <kanashiro> schopin, let's suppose you uploaded a package to the development release and it caused a component mismatch, what are the possibilities to sort this out?

 16:46 <schopin> MIR the component, or somehow fix the package relationship that caused the component mismatch, by e.g. drop a Recommends into a Suggests.

 16:46 <kanashiro> schopin, thanks.

 16:47 <kanashiro> no further questions

 16:48 <sil2100> Okay, time for the vote

 16:48 <sil2100> #startvote schopin to become core-developer
