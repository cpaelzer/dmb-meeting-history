 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:31 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:31 <cpaelzer> licensecheck would usually be foundations, seems like one of the explosions we also sometimes see with lintian

 14:32 <cpaelzer> slyon: is this known in foundations already?

 14:32 <slyon> nothing new, IMO. jaraco.context needs to be looked at by openstack

 14:32 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes. the MIR is already filed: https://launchpad.net/bugs/1972853

 14:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1972853 in libxs-parse-sublike-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] lib*-perl" [Undecided, Confirmed]

 14:32 <cpaelzer> yes, but last week jamespage wasn't around

 14:32 <cpaelzer> he is now

 14:32 <slyon> we did a combined MIR for all of those *-perl packages

 14:32 <cpaelzer> jamespage: are you ok to take jaraco to your team?

 14:32 <cpaelzer> slyon: great

 14:33 <slyon> (actuall, Simon did, kudos!)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> on requests -> python-charset-normalizer, that was picke dup by server already (and had some help from people on +1 duty)

 14:33 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yep

 14:33 <cpaelzer> slyon: did that also include the perl things dependet on by sphinx?

 14:33 <slyon> Yes, we had olivier look into requests a bit, too. I think there was some exchange with the server team happening

 14:33 <cpaelzer> yes - that is what i referred to

 14:34 <slyon> cpaelzer: yes. it also includes the sphinx changes. they are all very similar

 14:34 <cpaelzer> libsoup is driven by the desktop team already

 14:34 <cpaelzer> libqrtr-glib as well

 14:34 <cpaelzer> nothing super new that needs action here I think

 14:34 <slyon> ACK

 14:34 <didrocks> o/

 14:34 * cpaelzer feels good that teams are more on top of things nowadays!

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:34 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:35 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:35 <cpaelzer> yep that reflects what I meant with "seen many in my inbox"

 14:35 <sarnold> wow

 14:35 <cpaelzer> 13 to assign

 14:36 <cpaelzer> of which 5 are hopefulyl-easy-perl cases

 14:36 <jamespage> I can take that manila MIR - I've not been involved in that

 14:36 <cpaelzer> didrocks: which of the desktop cases do you think benefit the most from you knowing Desktop better than the others?

 14:36 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage, assigning manila to you

 14:36 <joalif> @cpaelzer https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libfreeaptx/+bug/1971767 shouldn't be there, i've done the review and got an ack from security too

 14:36 <jamespage> beat you to it :)

 14:37 <didrocks> cpaelzer: I think wireplumber, libsoup3, gnome-console

 14:37 <cpaelzer> indeed joalif let me set the status right

 14:37 <cpaelzer> didrocks: would you take these then

 14:37 <didrocks> happy to take the 3 of them, not commiting to them for next week though

 14:37 <cpaelzer> then we can re-look at the list and look to assign the rest starting with me and slyon

 14:37 <cpaelzer> not-next-week is ok didrocks as long as it is not 6 weeks

 14:37 <slyon> yes. and joalif possibly?

 14:38 <didrocks> definitively won’t be 6

 14:38 * didrocks just won 3 new tabs

 14:38 <slyon> haha

 14:38 <sarnold> hehhe

 14:38 <cpaelzer> ok updated the freeaptx case joalif

 14:38 <joalif> thanks

 14:39 <cpaelzer> the perl'y things are probably all similar

 14:40 <cpaelzer> and in the past often got a fast pass not needing security,but one never knows

 14:40 <slyon> they should be straight forward, yes

 14:40 <cpaelzer> and it should be joalif or me

 14:40 <cpaelzer> let me try

 14:40 <cpaelzer> that leaves libldac libqtr-glib and ruby-webrick for joalif and slyon

 14:40 <cpaelzer> could you pick those as you see fit?

 14:40 <joalif> so what do I get ?

 14:40 <slyon> I dont know any of those, so don't care

 14:41 <slyon> I can take the first two I guess :)

 14:41 <joalif> me neither

 14:41 <slyon> libldac and libqtr-glib

 14:41 <slyon> that'd leave ruby-webrick for joalif ?

 14:41 <joalif> and libdac ?

 14:41 <cpaelzer> I have all assigned now

 14:41 <cpaelzer> as discussed

 14:41 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:42 <slyon> joalif: I'll take libldac, too

 14:42 <cpaelzer> with so much inbound and plenty of PTO days coming (christian central europe Thu + often Fri) and Memorial day in US we should try to be fast, but might not make all of them by next week

 14:42 <cpaelzer> just to set expectations for anyone watching, these might take a bit more

 14:42 <didrocks> just refreshing the page… feeling better

 14:42 <sarnold> \o/

 14:42 <cpaelzer> let us say 2 weeks :-)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:43 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:43 <sarnold> amurray finished libfreeaptx while I was asleep (distributed companies are neat :) and telegraf is in-progress, but this week is my cve triage week, so less progress there than one might wish

 14:43 <sarnold> oh sigh I jumped the gun didn't it

 14:43 <cpaelzer> you did

 14:43 <cpaelzer> none of the incompletes needs our acation

 14:43 <cpaelzer> one is from last weeks meeting

 14:43 <cpaelzer> and the other was just a tracking change

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:44 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:44 <cpaelzer> see above :-)

 14:44 <cpaelzer> seen freeaptx and glad to hear that telegraf is ongoing

 14:44 <cpaelzer> sergiodj: ^^ FYI

 14:44 <cpaelzer> sarnold: given the peak on the MIR queue today you can let the team know that quite likely a similar sized peak will hit your queue

 14:45 <sarnold> *nod*

 14:45 <cpaelzer> not all might need a security review

 14:45 <cpaelzer> but relatively, there should be some

 14:45 <sarnold> now would be a good time to ask if anyone would like a change of pace :)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> TBH you (=security team) asked to get things early and we have seen many teams do so

 14:45 <cpaelzer> so we should feel good about this

 14:45 <sarnold> I do!

 14:46 <didrocks> indeed, we are still far from FF

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thanks on security then

 14:46 <sarnold> it really does feel like things are clipping along nicely

 14:46 <didrocks> or does it mean we will have a lot more at FF? :p

 14:46 <cpaelzer> indeed

 14:46 <sarnold> 22.04 was 'solid' things, and 22.10 is "lets get these new things going"

 14:46 <cpaelzer> no, major shifts e.g. pipewire in desktop are causing half of them

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:46 <sarnold> none here

 14:46 <didrocks> nothing from me

 14:46 <slyon> none

 14:46 <joalif> nothing

 14:47 <cpaelzer> me neither

 14:47 <cpaelzer> ok, that was a lot already

 14:47 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:47 <cpaelzer> see you next week and happy reviewing

 14:47 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

 14:47 <slyon> thanks!

 14:47 <didrocks> thanks cpaelzer, all!

 14:47 <joalif> thanks all!

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
