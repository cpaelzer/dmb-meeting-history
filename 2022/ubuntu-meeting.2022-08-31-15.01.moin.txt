 15:06 <ddstreet> as mentioned before, we should probably keep this on the ML

 15:06 <mapreri> still in inbox, yes.

 15:06 <ddstreet> but please let's all remember to reply before next mtg :)

 15:07 <ddstreet> thanks luna__!

 15:07 <luna__> a bit to slow with the copy and paste tough

 15:07 <ddstreet> this will need review from you both, so no need to discuss now, but hopefull we can finalize it on the ML and/or by next mtg

 15:08 <ddstreet> ok that's all the ml threads, unless i'm missing something

 15:08 <luna__> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-backports/2022-August/022925.html

 15:08 <ddstreet> ah thanks again :)

 15:09 <ddstreet> #topic open bugs needing discussion

 15:09 <mapreri> haven't even looked at what's open now :(

 15:09 <ddstreet> i reviewed the dh-python bug, and there were some issues there

 15:09 <ddstreet> unit193 said it should just be dropped, so i believe teward[m] marked it wontfix

 15:10 <luna__> i can't see it as open

 15:10 <ddstreet> i dont know of anyone here thinks it might be worth looking into backporting it

 15:10 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dh-python/+bug/1983414

 15:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1983414 in dh-python (Ubuntu) "[BPO] dh-python 5.20220403 to focal" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 15:11 <luna__> yep teward teward[m] has indeed closed it as not fixing

 15:11 <teward[m]> ddstreet: correct i did a won'tfix on one of the bugs because Unit mentioned in the message it should be dropped given $REASONS

 15:11 <ddstreet> the main issue, at least from my relatively quick review, was the py2 dh_python2 script, which did a pkg move, so that would need to be properly handled in the backport

 15:11 <mapreri> holed on

 15:11 <mapreri> the main reason behind that bpo was to have the pyproject support, right?

 15:11 <mapreri> IIRC

 15:11 <ddstreet> yep that's my understanding

 15:12 <ddstreet> and that would require a few other backports for deps

 15:12 <teward[m]> "This is needed to refresh the yt-dlp package as it has support for 'environment markers'"

 15:12 <mapreri> I understand that such reason still stands, so I think I'd want to look at it as imho it makes sense to have

 15:12 <teward[m]> pybuild-plugin-pyproject <-- not tested

 15:12 <mapreri> ddstreet: what's "a few"?

 15:12 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dh-python/+bug/1983414/comments/1

 15:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1983414 in dh-python (Ubuntu) "[BPO] dh-python 5.20220403 to focal" [Undecided, Fix Released]

 15:12 <ddstreet> i listed the deps in my comment

 15:13 <ddstreet> specifically, python3-{build,installer,tomli} packages

 15:13 <ddstreet> which aren't available in focal.

 15:13 <mapreri> doesn't sound like a goal-blocker to me, just bpo those all?

 15:13 <ddstreet> yeah i think it's quite doable

 15:13 <mapreri> also I'm not sure there is a problem with the python2 thing?

 15:14 <ddstreet> but just would need someone to do the dep backports, and properly adjust the backported dh-python package

 15:14 <mapreri> I don't see having the bpo package be uninstallable with something in the main suite as a problem?

 15:14 <ddstreet> you mean the conflicts with python2?

 15:14 <mapreri> yep

 15:14 <ddstreet> i mean i'd certainly prefer to address that, no?

 15:15 <mapreri> or, indeed, if that's only for dh_python2 is trivially solvable sure, but anyway, even if unsolved I don't think it's a blocker to me?

 15:15 <ddstreet> but then users of the backported dh-python would not be able to run any py2 script

 15:15 <mapreri> it's certainly preferable yes

 15:15 <mapreri> I'm mostly trying to understand how you feel about that particular point

 15:16 <ddstreet> personally, i think it should be fixed

 15:16 <ddstreet> i mean, if dh-python was actually *providing* python2, then that might be ok, but it's conflicting (which will force removal) of python2 only due to a single dh_python2 script

 15:17 <ddstreet> i think the right approach is to remove the dh_python2 from the backport, and remove the Conflicts: python2

 15:17 <mapreri> if it's only for that single script, it's probably best to drop it from dh-python yes

 15:17 <mapreri> it's B+R, not conflicting iiuc

 15:17 <mapreri> anyway, I got your point

 15:17 <ddstreet> that's certainly my preference, but it will depend on the details once someone gets into doing it

 15:17 <ddstreet> right B+R sorry

 15:18 <mapreri> I doubt I'd be able to pick up, but since it's something that might make sense to have, if unit193 wants to pick it up again at least I know your position :)

 15:18 <mapreri> (as I will tell him that I'm all for it and not give up just after one review!)

 15:18 <ddstreet> so should we reopen the bug, and/or add an action item for us to look at it?

 15:19 <ddstreet> yeah my review didn't mean to shut his work down

 15:19 <mapreri> I think it's fine as it is, I'll more informally poke him

 15:19 <ddstreet> ok hopefully we won't forget about it :)

 15:20 <ddstreet> i guess if he wants to backport yt-dlp anymore, he'll need to either fix that backport, or work on dh-python backport :)

 15:20 * mapreri just did

 15:20 <mapreri> IRC++

 15:20 <ddstreet> also fyi, i did approve one of his yt-dlp backports, which failed due to dh-python dep missing

 15:20 <mapreri> so it's bd-uninst atm?

 15:21 <ddstreet> #link https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/yt-dlp/2022.08.19-1~bpo20.04.1

 15:21 <mapreri> doesn't look failed to me?

 15:21 <mapreri> sorry, wrong page

 15:21 <mapreri> meh

 15:22 <mapreri> feel free to action me to poke him some more on this

 15:22 <mapreri> I think this is the first time.  how harsh should we be about unbuilt packages?

 15:22 <ddstreet> #action mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 15:22 * meetingology mapreri poke unit193 about yt-dlp dep on dh-python

 15:23 <ddstreet> well, he did upload both yt-dlp *and* dh-python, so if i'd accepted dh-python, then the yt-dlp upload would have built

 15:23 <ddstreet> so it's partially my fault for not realizing that before i accepted the yt-dlp upload

 15:23 <luna__> accept and rebuild?

 15:23 <ddstreet> buuuuut it certainly would have been better for him to not upload yt-dlp until dh-python was accepted

 15:23 <mapreri> I kind of believe this should go in that page describing when an upload is acceptable without a tracking bug report

 15:24 <ddstreet> luna__ yeah, if we do finally accept the dh-python backport, we can just do a rebuild of the yt-dlp

 15:24 <mapreri> if it requires special attention and the uploader knows of it, I reckon a bug is warrented.

 15:24 <luna__> ddstreet: sounds good

 15:24 <mapreri> (in fact, no rebuild is needed, lp would pick it up by itself since it's in bd-uninst)

 15:24 <ddstreet> mapreri yep i agree, the previous yt-dlp uploads have been bugless which i think was fine, but yeah once there's any complexity like this, we do need a bug

 15:24 <mapreri> (i think at least)

 15:24 <luna__> ah

 15:25 <ddstreet> ah didn't know it would automatically rebuild

 15:25 <mapreri> it's not a *re*build after all

 15:25 <ddstreet> right :)

 15:25 <ddstreet> didn't build at all yet :)

 15:25 <luna__> true

 15:25 <ddstreet> ok, anything else for that bug?

 15:26 <mapreri> none from me

 15:26 <luna__> not from me

 15:26 <ddstreet> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/elfutils/+bug/1987356

 15:26 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1987356 in elfutils (Ubuntu) "[BPO] elfutils/0.187-1 from Kinetic" [Undecided, Fix Committed]

 15:26 <ddstreet> i think this one is done and published, does it just need to move to fix-released?

 15:27 <ddstreet> i'll go ahead and mark it as such, since it does seem released

 15:27 <luna__> https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-backports/elfutils ?

 15:27 <mapreri> seems like you just did lol

 15:28 <luna__> seems to be in the repos

 15:28 <ddstreet> and there are 2 more bugs, but both appear to need a sponsor

 15:29 <mapreri> tbh, I would rather not look at anything more right now, as I have another meeting coming up on the hour and I'd like to prepare for it :3

 15:29 <ddstreet> ack, i think we can leave the unsponsored ones alone

 15:29 <ddstreet> ok that's all open bugs

 15:30 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 15:30 <ddstreet> anything else from anyone?

 15:30 <ddstreet> luna__ you have any topics?

 15:30 <luna__> nope

 15:30 <ddstreet> ok final subtopic then, next meeting

 15:30 <ddstreet> #subtopic next mtg date

 15:30 <ddstreet> 1 month from now?

 15:31 <mapreri> mh

 15:31 <ddstreet> sep 28?

 15:31 <luna__> works for me

 15:31 <mapreri> 28 is looking crowded for me, what about oct 5 instead?

 15:31 <ddstreet> oct 5 works for me

 15:31 <luna__> have another meeting 5th Oct, but i don't do much backports work just curious so its okay to go without me

 15:31 <mapreri> (I also have a bit of travel the week before, that's why I'm not suggesting sep 21)

 15:32 <mapreri> mind you, I *can* do sep 28th, it's just that my agenda will look messy :3

 15:32 <mapreri> teward[m]: ?

 15:32 <teward[m]> no issue of oct 5, sept. 28 is a no go

 15:33 <ddstreet> let's do oct 5 then

 15:33 <ddstreet> same time, 15:00 UTC

 15:33 <mapreri> that makes it easy i guess

 15:33 <mapreri> sure

 15:33 <ddstreet> luna__ if you have interest in joining backporters team, feel free to let us know in a mtg or ML :-)

 15:34 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet schedule next mtg Oct 5 15:00 UTC

 15:34 * meetingology ddstreet schedule next mtg Oct 5 15:00 UTC

 15:34 <luna__> will think about it and do if so

 15:34 <ddstreet> ok i think that's all the topics, last chance for anything else?

 15:34 <ddstreet> #endmeeting
