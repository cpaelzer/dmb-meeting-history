 14:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:30 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:30:21 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:30 <cpaelzer> Hello didrocks jamespage joalif (sl_yon) sarnold

 14:31 <sarnold> good morning

 14:31 <cpaelzer> hi sarnold

 14:31 <cpaelzer> I've pinged didrocks who might not be around, sl_yon surely isn't

 14:31 <cpaelzer> welcome everyone else

 14:32 <cpaelzer> today seems to be a light & fast sesson except my final begging at security reviews

 14:32 <cpaelzer> let's go

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:32 <cpaelzer> none AFAICS

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> first of all the lists get short \o/

 14:33 <sarnold> tk8.6 -> xterm feels new to me

 14:33 <cpaelzer> known cases libreoffice, screen-resolution, logcheck

 14:33 <cpaelzer> new is tk8.6

 14:33 <cpaelzer> yes sarnold I agree

 14:33 <cpaelzer> let us remember and check if it looks any different in -proposed

 14:34 <cpaelzer> the pysaml -> xmlschema is a known case, openstack is working on it (need a version update - coreycb is the one looking at it)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> tk8.6, hmmm

 14:34 <coreycb> cpaelzer: yes that's ready to sync once I get a +1 from ubuntu-release

 14:35 <cpaelzer> ok coreycb

 14:35 <coreycb> thanks for the help!

 14:35 <cpaelzer> juliank you are listed as uploader fot TK, let us know if you have any context on this

 14:35 <cpaelzer> s/fot/for/

 14:36 <juliank> ppc64el baseline rebuild?

 14:36 <juliank> I only did no-change builds

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:36 <juliank> xterm means that it depends on *some* terminal usually that got removed

 14:36 <cpaelzer> let us look what made it show up then

 14:36 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:37 <cpaelzer> I think it is x-terminal-emulator

 14:37 <cpaelzer> while xterm is an actual package in universe

 14:37 <cpaelzer> x-terminal-emulator is a provides from many packages

 14:37 <sarnold> https://termbin.com/wfpi

 14:37 <cpaelzer> I'd assume one is in main already

 14:37 <juliank> yes and that depends on how the seed is expanded, as cjwatson

 14:37 <sarnold> xterm though..

 14:37 <sarnold> bionic: 330-1ubuntu2.2, Pocket: updates, Component: universe

 14:37 <sarnold> focal: 353-1ubuntu1.20.04.2, Pocket: updates, Component: universe

 14:37 <sarnold> impish: 366-1ubuntu1, Pocket: release, Component: universe

 14:37 <sarnold> jammy: 372-1ubuntu1, Pocket: release, Component: universe

 14:37 <juliank> it seems some seed changed

 14:38 <cpaelzer> gnome-terminal is in main and provides it

 14:38 <juliank> we had that before, but I don't remember it, so best bet to wait for Colin to explain it one more time

 14:38 <cpaelzer> so just another false-positive then

 14:38 <cpaelzer> juliank: we know the problem

 14:38 <cpaelzer> juliank: but each time we have a new one we need to check it it indeed is the same

 14:38 <cpaelzer> this one is, so we can go on

 14:38 <cpaelzer> thanks for your input juliank

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:39 <cpaelzer> none

 14:39 <cpaelzer> \o/

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:39 <cpaelzer> xmlschema we have mentioned above

 14:39 <cpaelzer> rust/cargo are discussions about how to track the vendoring

 14:40 <cpaelzer> the rest is older

 14:40 <cpaelzer> onthing to act on IMHO

 14:40 <cpaelzer> except the rust comment probably needing review/discussion on github

 14:40 <cjwatson> tk8.6 probably appears in the expansion of a seed where gnome-terminal isn't present

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I've seen that sarnold already engaged there with schopin

 14:41 <cpaelzer> cjwatson: thanks - we are used to those false positives as it is now only seed, but also order dependent

 14:41 <cpaelzer> s/now only/not only/

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:41 <cjwatson> Only a bit

 14:41 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:41 <cpaelzer> well sarnold, we are back were we were last times

 14:41 <cpaelzer> left AFAICS of the urgent++++ cases are

 14:41 <cpaelzer> libtpms here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libtpms/+bug/1948748

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1948748 in swtpm (Ubuntu) "[MIR] swtpm" [High, In Progress]

 14:42 <cpaelzer> and glusterfs here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glusterfs/+bug/1950321

 14:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1950321 in glusterfs (Ubuntu) "[MIR] glusterfs" [Critical, Confirmed]

 14:42 <sarnold> security team recently completed swtpm and python-xmlschema -- glusterfs is still in progress, but sbea_ttie has a lot on his plate ..

 14:42 <cpaelzer> sarnold: can we sell you souls or anything of similar worth ot make it happen?

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I already tried to fix other tasks of sbeattie last week to gain some credit, but not paying off yet :-P

 14:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: alas we've already sacrificed souls..

 14:43 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, yeah :) that did help :) thanks

 14:43 <cpaelzer> sarnold: can I ask you to make as much and loud noise as you can in your internal security communication in regard to the urgency of these?

 14:43 <sarnold> cpaelzer: yes

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I hope the definition of deadlines and the regular queue checks will make us no more have the same situation in future cycles

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:44 <cpaelzer> not from me

 14:44 <sarnold> none from me

 14:44 <cpaelzer> and I guess everyone else burns remaining PTO before end of march or similar :-)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> thanks you

 14:45 <cpaelzer> sarnold: if security has more I can help in trade for our reviews let me know (that is how desperate I am) :-)

 14:45 <sarnold> aye, it might be worth an email to your local friendly hr staff about the policy of forcing everyone to coordinate time off in december and march..

 14:45 <cpaelzer> I have so many open cases with HR, let me not add this one yet :-)

 14:46 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, any chance you've got levers on whoever does budgeting? I keep hearing that our budget hasn't been approved yet..

 14:46 <sarnold> cpaelzer: granted that won't help *today* but maybe 24.04 would go better with a bit more forward planning today..

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I guess "no comment" is all I can say here :-)

 14:46 <cpaelzer> by that I'm closing for today

 14:46 <sarnold> cpaelzer: dang :) well, I tried

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
