 16:32 * meetingology ddstreet update tooling, requestbackport, backportpackage (carried over)

 16:32 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri upload (more of) all the tools (carried over, in progress)

 16:32 <ddstreet> carry over i assume?

 16:32 <mapreri> I got on it today, fwiw, nothing uploaded yet

 16:32 <mapreri> yep

 16:32 <mapreri> but it's happening !

 16:32 <ddstreet> #action mapreri upload (more of) all the tools (carried over, in progress)

 16:32 * meetingology mapreri upload (more of) all the tools (carried over, in progress)

 16:32 <ddstreet> hurray! :)

 16:32 <mapreri> now to hope nothing interrupts me... /o\

 16:32 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri fix lintian to not complain about ~bpo suffix (https://bugs.debian.org/1001399) (carried over)

 16:32 <ubottu> Debian bug 1001399 in lintian "lintian: adjust backports-upload-has-incorrect-version-number for ubuntu" [Normal, Open]

 16:32 <mapreri> so

 16:33 <mapreri> here

 16:33 <mapreri> the previous lintian maintainer stepped down, new one stepped up and they are hard at work on catching up with a bit of a leftoever mess (since the handover was very harsh and just didn't happen)

 16:34 <mapreri> I plan to poke a bit to get that into the eye range of the new maintainer soon

 16:34 <mapreri> .

 16:34 <mapreri> (in this way, I think it's fine not to work on a ubuntu-specific patch anymore)

 16:34 <ddstreet> sounds good, that's progress

 16:34 <ddstreet> should we keep the item here?

 16:34 <mapreri> yes please

 16:35 <ddstreet> #action mapreri fix lintian to not complain about ~bpo suffix (https://bugs.debian.org/1001399) (carried over)

 16:35 * meetingology mapreri fix lintian to not complain about ~bpo suffix (https://bugs.debian.org/1001399) (carried over)

 16:35 <ubottu> Debian bug 1001399 in lintian "lintian: adjust backports-upload-has-incorrect-version-number for ubuntu" [Normal, Open]

 16:35 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri review wiki page to see how we can highlight that backport requestors need to do the backport work and find a sponsor

 16:35 <mapreri> ok, _this_ slipped my mind

 16:35 <ddstreet> lol :)

 16:35 <ddstreet> that's ok :)

 16:35 <mapreri> adding a note, this is really trivial

 16:35 <ddstreet> #action mapreri review wiki page to see how we can highlight that backport requestors need to do the backport work and find a sponsor

 16:35 * meetingology mapreri review wiki page to see how we can highlight that backport requestors need to do the backport work and find a sponsor

 16:35 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri handle debhelper backport including revert dep on debugedit for focal-backports (carried over)

 16:35 <ddstreet> i think this one is done?

 16:36 <mapreri> mostly handled by ddstreet , thank you ♥

 16:36 <ddstreet> np :)

 16:36 <ddstreet> thanks for reviewing!

 16:36 <ddstreet> #subtopic mapreri start thread on ML about how to use bug status to define meaing in process

 16:36 <mapreri> this of course didn't happen

 16:36 <mapreri> you can leave it on me still

 16:36 <ddstreet> yeah, i think this will be good to do

 16:36 <ddstreet> #action mapreri start thread on ML about how to use bug status to define meaing in process

 16:36 * meetingology mapreri start thread on ML about how to use bug status to define meaing in process

 16:37 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) get DEB_VENDOR=ubuntu dch --bpo to DTRT pls (carried over)

 16:37 <ddstreet> should we carry this over unassigned? do you want to take it?

 16:37 <mapreri> no, I'm already a bit overloaded, sorry

 16:38 <ddstreet> how about i'll take it, since it's tooling-related

 16:38 <mapreri> (note that I'm not so overloaded to not be able to review a patch, if once comes my way)

 16:38 <ddstreet> but of course anyone can do it if they have time

 16:38 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet get DEB_VENDOR=ubuntu dch --bpo to DTRT pls (carried over)

 16:38 * meetingology ddstreet get DEB_VENDOR=ubuntu dch --bpo to DTRT pls (carried over)

 16:38 <ddstreet> #subtopic (unassigned) look at reviewer tooling such as 'queue' or other tools for reviewing/accepting/rejecting uploads, and closing the corresponding bugs (carried over)

 16:39 <ddstreet> i'll take this one too, as part of 'tooling' work

 16:39 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet look at reviewer tooling such as 'queue' or other tools for reviewing/accepting/rejecting uploads, and closing the corresponding bugs (carried over)

 16:39 * meetingology ddstreet look at reviewer tooling such as 'queue' or other tools for reviewing/accepting/rejecting uploads, and closing the corresponding bugs (carried over)

 16:39 <mapreri> or you could just leave it unassigned at m

 16:39 <mapreri> it's kind of clear we don't actually need such specilize tool to review the queue

 16:40 <ddstreet> i do hope to start looking at tooling by the next mtg

 16:40 <mapreri> k

 16:40 <ddstreet> yeah we probably don't, but it's possible we just don't know what awesomeness we're missing ;-)

 16:40 <mapreri> heh

 16:40 <ddstreet> ok that's all the previous items

 16:40 <ddstreet> #topic Open Mailing List Threads

 16:41 <ddstreet> #subtopic clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:41 <ddstreet> i guess we need to continue this on the ML?

 16:41 <ddstreet> i can send a reply to try to revive the discussion

 16:42 <mapreri> for myself, I'm good also without an up, it's just that I've got too many emails to read/write these months

 16:42 <mapreri> I don't understand, I feel like normally they aren't this many…

 16:42 <mapreri> these*

 16:42 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet send ML reply to continue thread re: clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:42 * meetingology ddstreet send ML reply to continue thread re: clarification on specific wording for no-bug-required backport exceptions

 16:42 <ddstreet> yeah, maybe just 'that time of year'?

 16:42 <ddstreet> though summertime usually is *less* busy

 16:43 <mapreri> is it summer already? :O

 16:43 <ddstreet> it's around 40C where I am!

 16:43 <ddstreet> that counts as summer for me :)

 16:43 <mapreri> /o\

 16:43 <mapreri> 40c is enough to make me run away :P

 16:44 <mapreri> (says the person who is actually at 27 indoor already)

 16:44 <mapreri> anyway

 16:44 <ddstreet> lol, yeah i am super glad i have a pool ;-)

 16:44 <ddstreet> #subtopic TB ML thread for charter

 16:44 <ddstreet> so, for this

 16:45 <ddstreet> i'd like to just clear up our charter a bit with some minor changes, and start using it as our 'official' rules

 16:45 <ddstreet> i don't like continuing to have just 'draft' rules

 16:46 <ddstreet> i can have an updated version by next meeting, if you have no objections (then we can discuss/vote on adopting the updated version)

 16:46 <mapreri> should we move more stuff from the charter into the internal policy?

 16:46 <ddstreet> and of course, any feedback from the TB in the future can be integrated into it

 16:46 <mapreri> and keep mostly the "mission" part of it?

 16:46 <ddstreet> yep i think so

 16:46 <ddstreet> we can discuss now a bit if you want?

 16:46 <ddstreet> or i can make some changes and then we can discuss the details next mtg?

 16:47 <ddstreet> but yeah, i agree with moving most of the details into internal policy, just keep core stuff in the charter

 16:47 <mapreri> if you already have a plan, is probably more efficient if you get a draft

 16:48 <ddstreet> sounds good, and i'll add an action to discuss the new draft next mtg

 16:48 <ddstreet> i dont think there is any hurry to get something in place, just would be good to make progress on it over the next couple mtgs

 16:48 <mapreri> ack

 16:49 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet rework charter and internal policies documentation, have drafts for next mtg

 16:49 * meetingology ddstreet rework charter and internal policies documentation, have drafts for next mtg

 16:50 <ddstreet> #action discuss charter/policies drafts

 16:50 * meetingology discuss charter/policies drafts

 16:50 <ddstreet> #topic Open Bugs needing discussion

 16:50 <ddstreet> i don't think there are any?

 16:50 <mapreri> waity

 16:51 <mapreri> nah

 16:51 <mapreri> there is only one bug, but that is fine as it is

 16:51 <ddstreet> #topic AOB

 16:51 <ddstreet> any other topics?

 16:51 <mapreri> none from me

 16:52 <teward> nope

 16:52 <mapreri> oh, hi teward !

 16:52 <mapreri> o/

 16:52 <ddstreet> o/ teward

 16:52 <teward> i was delayed by FT job work phone meeting sorry

 16:52 <ddstreet> ok last thing then is scheduling next mtg, we all ok with 1 month as usual?

 16:52 <mapreri> that makes it the 13th right?  That's perfect

 16:52 <teward> works for me

 16:53 <mapreri> will any of you be at DebConf?

 16:53 <teward> nope

 16:53 <teward> too busy bashing my head against Windows servers at FT job >.<

 16:53 <ddstreet> #action ddstreet schedule next mtg for july 13
