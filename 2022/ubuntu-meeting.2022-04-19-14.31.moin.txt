 14:31 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:31 <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:31:15 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 14:31 <didrocks> hey

 14:31 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 14:31 <cpaelzer> hello

 14:31 <cpaelzer> anything but a fast meeting would be odd today as we are in final freeze

 14:31 <joalif> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> hi sarnold joalif jamespage slyon didrocks

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:31 <cpaelzer> none

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 14:32 <cpaelzer> all known false positives, except (to me) llvm -> z3

 14:33 <cpaelzer> [Reverse-Depends: libz3-dev, llvm-13-dev (MAIN)]

 14:33 <cpaelzer> slyon: maybe just add an extra exclude and be done with it?

 14:33 <cpaelzer> as -dev do not have to be in main and are often only there due to the auto-include

 14:34 <sarnold> hah I didn't know we shipped z3..

 14:34 <cpaelzer> yes https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/germinate-output/ubuntu.jammy/all confirms it is only from llvm-13-dev

 14:35 <cpaelzer> uh

 14:35 <cpaelzer> but

 14:35 <cpaelzer> llvm-13 recommends llvm-13-dev

 14:35 <cpaelzer> so auto-exclude won't cut it

 14:35 <slyon> yeah... is this related to the recent rustc MIR?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> no this is independent (to my knowledge)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> it is just llvm-13 being in main in jammy and for whatever reason it has grown a dep to z3

 14:36 <cpaelzer> slyon: could we leave checking the details with you as llvm in foundations?

 14:36 <slyon> yes, I guess that's fine

 14:37 <slyon> llvm13 is still kind of kernel, but foundations also has some stake in it :)

 14:37 <cpaelzer> kernel isn't here inhtis meeting 8they know why) :-)

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 14:38 <cpaelzer> rustc was promoted

 14:38 <cpaelzer> that was the only recent update

 14:39 <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 14:39 <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 14:39 <sarnold> I don't believe anything was finished last week when I was out

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok I see telegraf is the next here, but we managed to get all 22.04 done

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: the most important thing last week was that I wanted to thank you and sbeattie - but no one was around

 14:40 <sarnold> it's almost time to celebrate telegraf's birthday :)

 14:40 <cpaelzer> thank you both

 14:40 <cpaelzer> please keep training the new team members to do reviews so that we no more collect such a backlog

 14:40 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> not from me

 14:40 <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer -- it was a team effort :) -- we couldn't have done it without the others also tackling reviews, as well

 14:40 <didrocks> nothing for me, good luck everyone with the release :)

 14:40 <sarnold> none from me

 14:40 <slyon> nothing

 14:40 <joalif> nothing

 14:42 <cpaelzer> ok, as predicted a light and easy meeting

 14:42 <cpaelzer> enjoy the calm time, the next release will open for development soon enough

 14:42 <cpaelzer> thank you all

 14:42 <cpaelzer> o/
