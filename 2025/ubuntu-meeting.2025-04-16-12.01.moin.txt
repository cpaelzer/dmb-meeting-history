 12:01 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 18 December 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:01 <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:01:48 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

 12:01 <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 12:01 <Wild_Man> I need to change the date

 12:02 <lucyllewy> ðŸ¤­

 12:02 <soumyadghosh> IRC supports emojis? Woww

 12:02 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 16 April 2025. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:02 <lucyllewy> nah, I'm just special

 12:03 <Wild_Man> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?

 12:04 <rubi1200> I have signed the Code of Conduct and yes I agree to be bound by it.

 12:04 <Wild_Man> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04 <Wild_Man> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and

 12:04 <Wild_Man> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:05 <Wild_Man> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:05 <Wild_Man> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

 12:06 <Wild_Man> Now, without any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...

 12:06 <Wild_Man> #topic rubi1200

 12:08 <rubi1200> Hi, my name is Rubi (yes, really a nickname). I am originally from South Africa but grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland. I love helping users on the platform as I did on Ubuntu Forums and try to dedicate as much time as possible to this task. Here is the link to my Discourse Membership Application:

 12:08 <rubi1200> https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/rubi1200-membership-application/58975

 12:09 <mapreri> o/

 12:09 <mapreri> sorry for being late!

 12:09 <MariusQuabeck> o/

 12:09 <lucyllewy> ðŸ‘‹

 12:09 <soumyadghosh> O/

 12:10 <rubi1200> is there any other information you would like me to provide?

 12:11 <lucyllewy> looks like your other links can be found on your application post, so that should be good for those

 12:11 <rubi1200> okay

 12:11 <mapreri> yeah, a link to your ubuntuforums profile would have been nice, but that was easy to find :)

 12:12 <mapreri> a question: you don't seem to be a moderator/staff anymore?

 12:12 <mapreri> or was that something that was done en masse after the old forum got closed?

 12:12 <rubi1200> correct. I was only staff for a few months but then life/work at the time did not allow me to dedicate the time I wanted to.

 12:12 <Wild_Man> You can not view the forum profiles unless you have an account and are signed it

 12:12 <Wild_Man> in

 12:13 <rubi1200> I was staff back in 2011

 12:13 <rubi1200> not recently

 12:13 <Wild_Man> He actually helped me learn how to be a moderator back then

 12:14 <rubi1200> I am happy to know you still remember that :-)

 12:15 <Wild_Man> rubi1200, I think the board members want to know how long have you been contributing on the forums after coming back from being gone?

 12:15 <mapreri> Wild_Man: I do have an account there of course :)

 12:16 <mapreri> that the profile is not public is annoying, as in cases like this being able to see stuff like join date, total posts, posts per day, etc is useful

 12:16 <rubi1200> There was a period of inactivity from about 2011 to 2014 then I was active again for some time, then a period of inactivity but from about 2019 I have been actively helping users

 12:17 <rubi1200> the profiles were never publicly accessible, unfortunately

 12:17 <Bashing-om> ^ and helping staff.

 12:17 <Wild_Man> I can say that rubi1200 has been a big help in Ubuntu Discourse

 12:17 <mapreri> the fact that your posts per day on the forums is still roundable to 2/day despite years-long pause, that's quite something!

 12:17 <mapreri> ;)

 12:17 <soumyadghosh> I couldn't see your forum posts as I don't have an account there. I have just one question for you, how are you planning to improve tag usage in discourse?

 12:17 <lucyllewy> I'm super curious about the sneak peak at the bottom of your appllication that you hope to present something new to the community

 12:17 <rubi1200> is it possible to add screenshots here?

 12:17 <lucyllewy> (that's just me being intrigued :P)

 12:18 <lucyllewy> Images aren't easy to share in IRC unless you upload them elsewhere and put a link here

 12:19 <Wild_Man> Any other questions?

 12:19 <mapreri> I'm good

 12:19 <soumyadghosh> Yeah I asked one

 12:19 <rubi1200> I had screenshots I took of my profile page before the switch

 12:20 <Wild_Man> rubi1200, soumyadghosh asked a question

 12:20 <rubi1200> it is a work in progress but I want to find a way to spread tags across more categories and introduce n ew tags

 12:20 <rubi1200> sorry, slow fingers

 12:20 <rubi1200> also, merge, rename, consolidate tags

 12:21 <soumyadghosh> any category names you have in mind for expansion?

 12:21 <rubi1200> and write a guide for new users on how to best use tags on Discourse

 12:21 <lucyllewy> I have no questions... this is a good application that is well written and evidenced with lots of supporting testimonials.

 12:22 <rubi1200> well right now the majority of tags are lumped under one category called Other Tags. This is the view I have as an ordinary user. But, I want to propose a new structure with for example categories like Support and Help, Development, Server etc. These are of course just some initial ideas

 12:23 <Bashing-om> I am well aware of rubi1200's works - no questions.

 12:24 <Wild_Man> #voters Wild_Man Bashing-om MariusQuabeck soumyadghosh lucyllewy mapreri

 12:25 <soumyadghosh> @rubi1200 IIRC Support and Help and Server are there

 12:25 <soumyadghosh> Anyways, I'll not drag it further.
