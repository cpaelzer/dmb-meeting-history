 15:33 <sarnold> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

 15:33 <sarnold> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:34 <sarnold> in mismatches, esmtp and xterm both feel familiar, lets skip /.

 15:34 <sarnold> proposed has some intel driver things

 15:34 <sarnold> hey slyon

 15:34 <sarnold> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:34 <cpaelzer> uh, here as well ( a bit) - sorry timezone madness

 15:34 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold

 15:35 <sarnold> daylight stupid time

 15:35 <slyon> o/ (sorry having a meeting conflict)

 15:35 <sarnold> libva -> intel-media-driver, from desktop, hopefully jbicha / seb128 can be on top of this

 15:35 <cpaelzer> libva is an open case, drivfen by desktop

 15:35 <cpaelzer> so yes, desktop is on this

 15:36 <seb128> we are actively working on it

 15:36 <cpaelzer> I wasn't aware of the right side of this tree though

 15:36 <sarnold> pcs -> ruby-rackup and ruby-rack -> ruby-rack-session are likely on server team, is that one for jchittum?

 15:36 <cpaelzer> that is for us indeed

 15:36 <cpaelzer> we looked at it

 15:37 <cpaelzer> we would either need to move too much into the future (not happeneing so late)

 15:37 <sarnold> and as usual, the kernel does kernel things, I hope apw and team are on top of the linux-realtime and linux-signed-realtime

 15:37 <seb128> (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libva/+bug/2104050)

 15:37 <cpaelzer> or we need to remove what is in proposed

 15:37 <cpaelzer> the removal is what will happen soon

 15:37 <sarnold> cpaelzer: ack, thanks

 15:37 <sarnold> "newer versions require libva2" I thuoght we just put work into libva? heh

 15:39 <sarnold> well, I think all from this graph is moving

 15:39 <sarnold> #topic New MIRs

 15:39 <sarnold> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

 15:39 <sarnold> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:39 <sarnold> empty? or broken? heh

 15:39 <sarnold> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:39 <cpaelzer> empty

 15:39 <cpaelzer> if not in this phase of the cycle then when could it be empty

 15:40 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glycin/+bug/2093182

 15:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glycin/+bug/2093182 is back to desktop but OK'ish

 15:41 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rust-sequoia-sqv/+bug/2089690

 15:41 <cpaelzer> all others are older or expires

 15:41 <sarnold> the recent change is expires, odd, I haven't seen that in ages

 15:41 <cpaelzer> because we got better and let rarley something expire

 15:42 <cpaelzer> I think we can go on with the agenda

 15:42 <cpaelzer> does it work if I paste it ... ?

 15:42 <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsass-python/+bug/2095581 was waiting on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsass/+bug/2095582 -- and nico finished that up just before leaving ..

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

 15:42 <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues

 15:43 <cpaelzer> and a closing yes to the libsass case, thanks sarnold

 15:43 <sarnold> oh hah I didn't notice the spelling fix needed for https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/81

 15:43 <cpaelzer> od to open an md file on libsass ...

 15:45 <mylesjp> is there anything else from the openstack side needed for libsass? We're just blocked on Horizon until libsass and python-libsass are promoted.

 15:45 <sarnold> aye, but I wasn't going to harrass him about that on his final day here, heh

 15:45 <cpaelzer> makes sense sarnold

 15:45 <cpaelzer> hi mylesjp, I was just trying to read through to make that decision

 15:46 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsass-python/+bug/2095581 is fine

 15:46 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsass/+bug/2095582

 15:46 <cpaelzer> is "Security team ACK for promoting libsass to main, with the considerations described in the paragraph above."

 15:46 <cpaelzer> I need to find what the ask was

 15:47 <cpaelzer> "In summary, for a package that hasn't been maintained in 2 years it seems to be in pretty good shape and, with the use case intended by openstack, it poses minimal risks. It should be noted that if the libsass API was exposed to untrusted input via custom themes or similar functionality served to users, crashes would be quite easy to occur given the nature of the library. Programs that use this library should take reasonable precautions when

 15:47 <cpaelzer> using it."

 15:47 <cpaelzer> mylesjp: is this in the openstack usage parsing only our own, or user controlled input?

 15:47 <sarnold> aka "don't build the next squarespace with this"

 15:47 <mylesjp> I believe only our own

 15:48 <cpaelzer> can you state that on the bug please mylesjp?

 15:48 <cpaelzer> then I should be able to promote both tomorrow

 15:48 <mylesjp> Yep I'll confirm that.

 15:48 <mylesjp> thanks

 15:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: thanks for fixing the typo

 15:48 <cpaelzer> I'm on https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/81/files now

 15:48 <cpaelzer> makes sense, merging

 15:49 <cpaelzer> there also is this : https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/82

 15:49 <cpaelzer> IMHO this makes sense

 15:49 <cpaelzer> as Simon said, the rules were good on this

 15:49 <cpaelzer> but the TODO forces them to state which way they think they want to go

 15:49 <cpaelzer> any objection to it?

 15:50 <sarnold> none here

 15:50 <cpaelzer> I only think this should be TODO, TODO-A, TODO-B

 15:50 <cpaelzer> not TODO-A, TODO-A, TODO-B

 15:52 <cpaelzer> added a review

 15:52 <cpaelzer> and a proposed change

 15:52 <cpaelzer> I think we are good

 15:52 <cpaelzer> all else is in draft

 15:52 <cpaelzer> time to jump to the security queue?

 15:52 <sarnold> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/83

 15:53 <sarnold> this is a bug report

 15:53 <cpaelzer> oh

 15:53 <cpaelzer> how could I miss that

 15:54 <cpaelzer> This needs someone to dive into it

 15:54 <cpaelzer> i'd love to but I can't right now :-/

 15:55 <cpaelzer> open for debug-volunteers

 15:55 <cpaelzer> poor launchpad is so hammered with things, I can't even get the source to have a look

 15:56 <sarnold> poor little guy :(

 15:59 <cpaelzer> I gave jbicha an acknowledgement so he does not think we ignore him

 15:59 <cpaelzer> but I can't see an immediate "you debug this" I could assign it to

 15:59 <cpaelzer> :-/

 15:59 <cpaelzer> let us go on with the agenda for today

 15:59 <jbicha> I'm not expecting immediate action on that bug at all

 15:59 <cpaelzer> bu tyou'd deserve it *sigh*

 16:00 <cpaelzer> but we can't as of right now AFAICS

 16:00 <jbicha> we can add it to the quirky(??) todo list :)

 16:00 <cpaelzer> sarnold: time is up and also time for security queue

 16:00 <sarnold> heh, yeah :/

 16:01 <sarnold> rodrigo spotted some stale crates in the rust-hwlib

 16:01 <sarnold> I know there is some progress on other MIRs recently that is stuck on me to provide feedback before we post

 16:01 <sarnold> alas it's been busy lately

 16:03 <sarnold> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

 16:03 <sarnold> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

 16:03 <sarnold> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

 16:03 <sarnold> Internal link

 16:03 <sarnold> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

 16:03 <sarnold> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

 16:03 <sarnold> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594

 16:03 <sarnold> the jira board is pleasingly well sorted

 16:04 <sarnold> oh looks like we got nghttp3 on our list

 16:05 <sarnold> heh lp-to-jira is taking an eternity

 16:05 <cpaelzer> yep

 16:05 <cpaelzer> there always is one more

 16:06 <sarnold> I wish I felt better about the path forward for http3 support in openssl3 vs curl (3?) vs all the servers ..

 16:06 <sarnold> https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-6022

 16:07 <sarnold> #topic Any other business?

 16:07 <mylesjp> all good on my end

 16:07 <jbicha> cpaelzer: could you review bug 2104050 to confirm that it is good to go, pending FFe approval then AA promotion?

 16:07 <jbicha> I meant bug 2097800

 16:08 <cpaelzer> mylesjp: please make sure subscriptions by the team are in place

 16:08 <mylesjp> will do, thanks

 16:08 <cpaelzer> that is the most common case something otherwise ready can#t be promoted

 16:08 <cpaelzer> I'll check tomorrow and then do it

 16:08 <cpaelzer> jbicha: looking ...

 16:09 <jbicha> cpaelzer: you can check after the meeting

 16:09 <cpaelzer> there is no time other than minimal sleep between now and my thu morning

 16:10 <cpaelzer> and thu morning was already meant for 360, hiring, spec and copydocs for the release

 16:10 <sarnold> heh, i'm pretty familiar with the idea of either something gets done now or it gets added to a queue that doesn't seem to shrink ..

 16:10 <cpaelzer> I'll queue you up, but want to give no hard promises :-/

 16:11 <cpaelzer> jbicha: give me the TL;DR to motivate this - I assume your upload prepped for after beta resolves the findings I had?

 16:11 <cpaelzer> I see Daniel explained some of my already

 16:11 <cpaelzer> yeah I just need more than seconds while in two meetings to see

 16:11 <cpaelzer> If you are confident all asks have been resolved I likely will come to the same conclusion

 16:12 <cpaelzer> Will try to start earlier tomorrow

 16:12 <cpaelzer> sorry jbicha , ... those are these days ...

 16:12 <sarnold> anything else?

 16:12 <jbicha> I'm sorry for contributing to the overload, I only pinged you in particular since you had done the initial review

 16:13 <jbicha> nothing else from me

 16:13 <sarnold> #endmeeting
