 17:00 <tinwood> #startmeeting openstack-charms-meeting

 17:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Jul  6 17:00:48 2016 UTC.  The chair is tinwood. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 17:00 <meetingology> 

 17:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 17:00 <tinwood> welcome all!

 17:01 <gnuoy> thanks

 17:01 <tinwood> The first topic is:

 17:01 <tinwood> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 17:01 <tinwood> Looking at the last minutes, gnuoy, it's about moving this meeting!?

 17:01 <gnuoy> sure, I've done a subtopic for each action in the past

 17:02 <gnuoy> but I'm guessing you're looking at me for moving this meeting...

 17:02 <tinwood> Not sure I follow.

 17:02 <gnuoy> #subtopic gnuoy to move this meeting

 17:02 <gnuoy> ^ that sort of thing

 17:02 <gnuoy> anyway

 17:02 <gnuoy> I have a gerrit request up for scheduling the meeting

 17:03 <gnuoy> but we can't have this slot

 17:03 <tinwood> (Still new at this) I guess I have to do that?

 17:03 <gnuoy> we can have: http://paste.ubuntu.com/18635394/

 17:03 <tinwood> And those map to times, I'm guessing.

 17:04 <gnuoy> tinwood, good point they are all 17:00 UTC

 17:04 <gnuoy> so, I propose openstack-meeting-4 biweekly-even

 17:04 <gnuoy> on a Monday

 17:05 <thedac> works for me

 17:05 <gnuoy> biweekly means we can have another meeting if we need for apac

 17:05 <tinwood> We'd have to move our charms catchup?

 17:05 <gnuoy> 1 week in USA friendly time, one week in apac friendly

 17:05 <tinwood> Or is that earlier? (UTC vs BST).

 17:06 <gnuoy> not everyone would attend both

 17:06 <thedac> tinwood:  that is one hour earlier

 17:06 <tinwood> Sounds okay then.

 17:06 <gnuoy> this meeting is 17:00 UTC

 17:06 <tinwood> Yes, I like those slots

 17:06 <coreycb> that time sounds good to me

 17:06 <gnuoy> ok, I will book that first slot, thanks

 17:06 <tinwood> Okay, sounds like an action - is that okay for you to do gnuoy as you're running with it.

 17:07 <gnuoy> yep

 17:07 <tinwood> #action gnuoy to try to book first slot from http://paste.ubuntu.com/18635394/

 17:07 * meetingology gnuoy to try to book first slot from http://paste.ubuntu.com/18635394/

 17:07 <tinwood> thanks gnuoy

 17:07 <tinwood> #topic State of Development for next Charm Release

 17:08 <tinwood> Any comments on this topic, please?

 17:08 <gnuoy> Keystone v3 support in the dashboard has landed

 17:08 <tinwood> \o/

 17:08 <thedac> Apparmor for nova-compute is close. I am fighting an amulet race condition at the moment.

 17:09 <gnuoy> A few caveats though. The dashboard now has to have a db relation if you want to use keystone v3

 17:09 <gnuoy> Designate and designate bind should land this week.

 17:09 <tinwood> barbican is very close, but has a bug upstream :(

 17:09 <coreycb> I have a number of deploy from source reviews ready for review, which should cover the bulk of getting DFS into shape.  the corresponding c-h changes have landed for the current reviews.

 17:10 <gnuoy> \o/

 17:10 <gnuoy> coreycb, hopefully you should get your charmhelper syncs for free

 17:10 <gnuoy> with jamespages ch sync for licensing changes

 17:10 <tinwood> So it looks like it's all heading in the right direction.

 17:11 <gnuoy> one more thing

 17:11 <tinwood> Any more before we move on?

 17:11 <gnuoy> all interfaces and layers are in Git/Gerrit now

 17:11 <gnuoy> ^ Repoint reviews if you need to!

 17:11 <coreycb> gnuoy, very nice

 17:11 <gnuoy> jamespages work but am happy to take the credit

 17:12 <coreycb> :)

 17:12 <tinwood> Oh, at the feature freeze day is next week.

 17:12 <gnuoy> yea! good point

 17:12 <thedac> coreycb++

 17:13 <gnuoy> Thursday next week to be precise

 17:13 <tinwood> So anything that has to make the release needs to be done by next Thursday.

 17:13 <coreycb> tinwood, feature-wise, at least

 17:13 <tinwood> yes

 17:14 <tinwood> next:

 17:14 <tinwood> #topic Release Bugs

 17:14 <tinwood> gnuoy, would you have your link handy?

 17:15 <tinwood> I'm guessing: #link https://goo.gl/HJjORI

 17:15 <gnuoy> yep

 17:15 <tinwood> Yes, there are 32 bugs on the list.

 17:16 <gnuoy> ...and we still seem to making little progress

 17:16 <gnuoy> that seems to be like 32 too many

 17:16 <tinwood> Do they need to be shifted by 16.07?

 17:17 <tinwood> bearing in mind some of them are quite 'old'.

 17:17 <gnuoy> I'm not sure, I think James does something about retargeting bus

 17:17 <gnuoy> * bugs

 17:17 <jamespage_shadow> so long as our run rate on bugs is stable, I think we're ok - we need to focus on high priority bugs first

 17:17 <jamespage_shadow> (of coursE)

 17:18 <jamespage_shadow> I would encourage you all to take some time over the next week and spend an hour on the bug queue

 17:18 <jamespage_shadow> please :-)

 17:18 <jamespage_shadow> I'll be focussing on reviews, landing and bugs in the next 8 days in the runup to final freeze

 17:18 <tinwood> okay, that sounds like a good plan.

 17:19 <tinwood> #topic Openstack Events

 17:19 <tinwood> I noticed an email that said there was a week to go for submitting talk abstracts for ODS?  Did I read that right?

 17:20 <gnuoy> tinwood, I think your looking at an out of data agends

 17:20 <gnuoy> * agenda

 17:20 <gnuoy> I have next agenda item as "Openstack talk submissions for ODS

 17:20 <gnuoy> "

 17:20 <gnuoy> ...

 17:20 <tinwood> indeed. sorry.

 17:20 <gnuoy> np, they were adds

 17:21 <tinwood> #topic Openstack talk submissions for ODS

 17:21 <gnuoy> So, hands up if you've submitted one!

 17:21 * gnuoy keeps his hand down

 17:21 * tinwood knows nothing :(

 17:21 <coreycb> I plan to submit one, not sure what yet though

 17:21 <tinwood> aparently ONE talk has been submitted so far.

 17:22 <tinwood> according to the email I saw.

 17:22 <thedac> gnuoy: we talked about a Openstack charms development talk we could co-author

 17:22 <gnuoy> yes, agreed

 17:23 <tinwood> I'd love to collaborate as I enjoy talking.

 17:23 <tinwood> but not if you've already got a partner!

 17:23 <thedac> sounds good we can discuss offline

 17:23 <gnuoy> and lets talk to markbaker about getting a charm school workshop as well

 17:24 <jamespage_shadow> some general guidance - talk about things openstack-ish that are really interesting to the general community

 17:24 <jamespage_shadow> we're (almost) and openstack project, so this is a great change to let the world know about us!

 17:24 <jamespage_shadow> deploying openstack talks +1000

 17:25 <jamespage_shadow> beisner, testing stuff good as well - maybe some s390-ish?

 17:25 <tinwood> Anything else on ODS?

 17:25 <tinwood> Any actions?

 17:26 <cargonza> wrt to charm school, I need to sync with the sales team to field the attendance...

 17:26 <tinwood> #action cargonza to sync with sales team re charm school at ODS Barcelona

 17:26 * meetingology cargonza to sync with sales team re charm school at ODS Barcelona

 17:26 <cargonza> I'll coordinate logistics with the admins (ie. rooms, av, etc.)

 17:26 <gnuoy> awesome

 17:27 <tinwood> excellent.

 17:27 <tinwood> Okay, next topic looks a bit strange.

 17:27 <tinwood> #topic What does the chair of this meeting do after the meeting?

 17:27 <gnuoy> ok, this one is mine

 17:28 <gnuoy> The chair of this meeting doesn't always seem to be following the actions outlined in the wiki

 17:28 <coreycb> drinks a beer and goes to bed?

 17:28 * tinwood lol

 17:28 <gnuoy> So, can we review the process and amend accordingly

 17:29 <tinwood> My first time so ..

 17:29 <gnuoy> tinwood, I think thats an action for jamespage and I

 17:29 <jamespage_shadow> agreed -

 17:29 <jamespage_shadow> once we move under #openstack for meetings we get automated minutes; but I'd like for us to announce the meeting prior to it happening

 17:30 <jamespage_shadow> and summarize on the openstack-dev ML afterwards

 17:30 <tinwood> #action gnuoy & jamespage to review the chair's post meeting process and amend as required.

 17:30 * meetingology gnuoy & jamespage to review the chair's post meeting process and amend as required.

 17:30 <jamespage_shadow> which is not as documented on the ubuntu wiki, but that's where we came from , not where we want to be

 17:30 <jamespage_shadow> lets get that sorted out between now and next week

 17:31 <gnuoy> tinwood, sorry, I meant previous chairs not you

 17:31 <gnuoy> what I really meant was:

 17:31 <tinwood> okay, that sounds good.  I'm hoping one of you is a chair for the first openstack-meetings meeting.

 17:31 <gnuoy> We have a process documented and I don;t think its clear to everyone so lets review that

 17:32 <tinwood> Right, so there's an action for that.  okay to move on?

 17:32 <gnuoy> sounds good to me

 17:32 <tinwood> #topic workload status messages, max 20 chars and proper case?

 17:32 <gnuoy> ok, so, thats me as weel

 17:32 <gnuoy> * well

 17:32 <tinwood> I think I'm guilty here.

 17:33 * thedac hides

 17:33 <gnuoy> There was a suggestion that we are consistent accross all charms and use proper caps and limit them to 20 chars

 17:33 <tinwood> When you say 'Proper Caps', what do you mean?

 17:33 <gnuoy> I'm not convinced tbh. I think we'll loose valuable info

 17:33 <gnuoy> Like this

 17:33 <gnuoy> rather than

 17:33 <gnuoy> like this

 17:34 <tinwood> Okay, that's good.

 17:34 <tinwood> What's the driver?

 17:34 <tinwood> for 20 chars only?

 17:34 <thedac> I agree a max 20 chars will lose valuable information

 17:34 <gnuoy> I think its useful to say: all these interfaces are missing...

 17:34 <gnuoy> thats more that 20chars right there

 17:35 <coreycb> that is fairly limiting, 20 chars

 17:35 <coreycb> perhaps the requester will negotiate

 17:35 <tinwood> Unless it's "'mysql', 'hsm', is miss..."

 17:36 <jamespage_shadow> okies - so I think working some examples might be useful

 17:36 <jamespage_shadow> then we can review appropriately and see what works well

 17:36 <coreycb> jamespage, +1

 17:36 <tinwood> It sounds like we need to pull together all of the workload statuses we set, put them down somewhere, and review it?  Or is that too much?

 17:37 <coreycb> or gnuoy ^

 17:37 <gnuoy> Maybe aim for nice caps and succint message but not limit chars

 17:37 <gnuoy> coreycb, haha that was jamespage

 17:37 <coreycb> lol

 17:37 <coreycb> tinwood, I think that's a good idea

 17:38 <coreycb> at least a subset of the common messages

 17:38 <tinwood> This sounds like an action.  Who's not here today?

 17:39 <tinwood> Seriously, do we need this as a minuted action?

 17:39 <gnuoy> tinwood, I don't think so. Maybe lets all keep in mind the formatting of thos stauses

 17:39 <gnuoy> * those

 17:40 <tinwood> Can I ask where the '20' came from?

 17:40 <gnuoy> it was a suggestion floating around for people with limited terminal width

 17:40 <thedac> --format yaml FTW

 17:41 <gnuoy> haha yeah

 17:42 <tinwood> okay, so no action, but try to keep them short and snappy.  assess_status() is a repeat offender as it concatenates missing interfaces ... a lot.

 17:42 <tinwood> #topic Openstack Events

 17:42 <tinwood> We may have covered this, but any more events?

 17:42 <gnuoy> Well ODS but I think we've covered that

 17:43 <tinwood> Ok, moving on to:

 17:43 <tinwood> #topic Open Discussion

 17:43 <tinwood> The floor is yours.

 17:44 <gnuoy> I have nothing to openly discuss :-)

 17:44 * tinwood chuckles

 17:44 <thedac> Do we want to discuss the email thread about hosting third party OS charms?

 17:44 <tinwood> fire away.

 17:44 <thedac> congress and charm partner charms

 17:45 <thedac> Should all charms go upstream or is there a selection criteria?

 17:45 <gnuoy> there are no 3rd party os charms

 17:46 <jamespage_shadow> as a project, openstack charms should be embracing anyone who wants to charm their part of openstack

 17:46 <thedac> agreed. I am aksing if the charm partner SDN charms should also be in this category

 17:46 <jamespage_shadow> publication of such charms to the juju charm store is dependent on them meeting the criteria as set out by the juju charm team

 17:47 <jamespage_shadow> thedac, +1 absoluletey

 17:47 <jamespage_shadow> thedac, plumgrid already asked, onos want to be

 17:47 <jamespage_shadow> I think the model of charms-core + charms-<group>-core will work well here

 17:47 <thedac> ok, so if we could document the procedure that would be helpful

 17:47 <jamespage_shadow> sure - I'll put something in the charm-guide

 17:48 <thedac> great

 17:48 <jamespage_shadow> #action jamespage document procedure for setup of sub-charm group ownership for SDN/storage vendors etc...

 17:48 * meetingology jamespage document procedure for setup of sub-charm group ownership for SDN/storage vendors etc...

 17:48 <tinwood> jamespage, beat me to it.

 17:49 <gnuoy> thanks jamespage

 17:49 <tinwood> Anything more for Open Discussion?

 17:49 <gnuoy> not from me

 17:49 <gnuoy> or from jamespage

 17:49 <thedac> I am good

 17:49 <coreycb> I'm good as well

 17:49 <tinwood> Great.

 17:50 <tinwood> #action Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 17:50 * meetingology Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 17:50 <tinwood> So the chair rotates; who's up for it next?

 17:50 <gnuoy> tinwood, it's in the wiki, one sec

 17:50 <gnuoy> tinwood, thedac is the winner

 17:50 <tinwood> \o/

 17:51 <tinwood> At the moment, we're assuming next Wednesday at 17.00UTC here again?

 17:51 <gnuoy> tinwood, yes, I hope its elsewhere but will post a redirect here if needs be

 17:51 <thedac> ok

 17:52 <tinwood> okay, then.  With no further ado, thanks everybody and ...

 17:52 <tinwood> #endmeeting
