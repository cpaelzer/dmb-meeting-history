 16:00 <coreycb> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Sep 27 16:00:22 2016 UTC.  The chair is coreycb. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:00 <coreycb> hi all

 16:00 <coreycb> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <coreycb> jgrimm, Add a url for server release bugs to irc commands for meetings

 16:01 <coreycb> jgrimm, do you have that handy?

 16:01 <coreycb> it used to be there, I think

 16:01 <jgrimm> ok, i spent some time thinking what i want to do there.  i'll leave as is, but look at fixing up the rls-y report if needed, and probably add back the rls-x url for weekly review

 16:02 <jgrimm> coreycb, this was really just a reminder for myself to figure out how to make this a more productive irc meeting.

 16:02 <jgrimm> please change my action to clean up rls-x and add back to agenda

 16:03 <coreycb> jgrimm, ok, will do.  fyi looking at the irc commands I don't see a bug link there.

 16:03 <jgrimm> i started poking people on the rls-x bugs that are sort of stuck in limbo or stale state this morning.

 16:03 <jgrimm> i need to add back the rls-y url then

 16:03 <coreycb> ok

 16:03 <jgrimm> fair to leave the current action then too

 16:03 <coreycb> jamespage, any news on this action item? checkin with old iscsitarget users on relevancy with new kernels

 16:03 <coreycb> greyback, ok

 16:03 <coreycb> whoa, jgrimm ^

 16:04 <jgrimm> hehe

 16:04 <greyback> np

 16:04 <coreycb> greyback, sorry

 16:04 <coreycb> powersj, any news on this action item? to put together iso testing signup sheet

 16:04 * greyback got an invite to this meeting, but no idea why. jibel?

 16:04 <ogra_> greyback, see warthogs ML

 16:04 <powersj> coreycb, done

 16:04 <jgrimm> coreycb, powersj is at a QA sprint this week

 16:05 <jgrimm> may not be available atm

 16:05 <ogra_> greyback, (and wrong channel anyway :P )

 16:05 <jgrimm> but he did accomplish that task

 16:05 <coreycb> powersj, awesome, I'll take it off the list

 16:05 <greyback> ogra_: tnx (heh, true too!)

 16:05 <cpaelzer> more participation at any price

 16:06 <coreycb> jgrimm, he responded so fast I don't think you saw it

 16:06 <jgrimm> coreycb, indeed!!!

 16:06 <coreycb> :)

 16:06 <coreycb> ok moving on

 16:06 <coreycb> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:06 <coreycb> we're in final beta freeze, 2 days from kernel freeze

 16:07 <coreycb> one week and 2 days until final freeze (Oct 6)

 16:07 <coreycb> and release is Oct 13th

 16:07 <jgrimm> yeah, hopefully final beta will release today

 16:08 <coreycb> also, next week is openstack's final release

 16:08 <coreycb> for Newton

 16:08 <coreycb> so that works out, a week before Yakkety

 16:08 <coreycb> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:08 <jgrimm> so on the  subject of final freeze, if there are bugs that we really really need to get in for server..  i want to be aware of them.   hit me on #ubuntu-server or email

 16:09 <coreycb> ok anything else for bugs?  I have no links to share.

 16:09 <jgrimm> the rls-y report is actually very clean

 16:09 <coreycb> er wait there's this: http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:09 <jgrimm> coreycb, thanks

 16:10 <coreycb> jgrimm, I added that link to the irc commands

 16:10 <coreycb> jgrimm, action item done for next week!

 16:10 <jgrimm> smoser is working on this one yet for FF -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-initramfs-tools/+bug/1493188

 16:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1493188 in cloud-utils (Ubuntu Xenial) ""overlayfs" no longer exists" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:10 <jgrimm> coreycb, :)

 16:11 <smoser> and i need to verify and makr so on the 'overlayroot' piece of that

 16:11 <smoser> and upload the cloud-utils piece (mount-image-callback)

 16:11 <smoser> both will happen today.

 16:11 <jgrimm> thanks smoser

 16:12 <coreycb> not many bugs for ubuntu-server in that list.  bug 1616107 is listed under ubuntu-server but it looks like the kernel team is working on it.

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1616107 in linux (Ubuntu Xenial) "Kernel oops + system freeze on network-bridge shutdown" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1616107

 16:12 <jgrimm> coreycb, correct.  i screened the list this morning. you can move on

 16:12 <cpaelzer> Y-dev as well - fyi @ rharper: bug 1628101 was a red herring and not due to bug 1626070

 16:12 <ubottu> Error: Could not gather data from Launchpad for bug #1628101 (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1628101). The error has been logged

 16:12 <ubottu> bug 1626070 in qemu (Ubuntu) "Removal of former release machine types breaks VMs using them" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1626070

 16:13 <cpaelzer> once read enough of it you realize it is by breaking your local system with a manually built qemu

 16:13 <nacc> hrm, odd, just hit a git-clone failure (not /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates on a fresh yakkety image (might be another bug :)

 16:13 <nacc> definitely worked last week :/

 16:14 <jgrimm> thanks cpaelzer

 16:15 <coreycb> ok thanks, test test test and report bugs for yakkety

 16:15 <coreycb> let's move on

 16:15 <jgrimm> yes

 16:16 <jgrimm> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-y-server-core

 16:16 <jgrimm> caribou, anything to update there ^^ or i can copy forward to z blueprint

 16:16 <caribou> jgrimm: well, two of them are completed, so I'll mark them as such

 16:17 <caribou> jgrimm: hmm, maybe even three of them, I think that the only one that needs to be carried forward is the secureboot one

 16:17 <caribou> jgrimm: I'll do a pass after the meeting & confirm to you

 16:18 <jgrimm> thanks caribou!!

 16:18 <jgrimm> coreycb, that is all
