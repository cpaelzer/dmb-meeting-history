 16:15 <slangasek> any questions?

 16:16 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:17 <slangasek> anything else today?

 16:17 <sil2100> Any objections for me to take care of merging different ppp-like packages?

 16:17 <bdmurray> Is there anything special to be aware about re bug 1531194?

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 1531194 in app-install-data-partner (Ubuntu Xenial) "13.04 "raring-partner" channel included in 14.04/15.04/15.10/16.04" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1531194

 16:18 <slangasek> sil2100: I don't think anyone here is likely to object to that; are there specific packages you have in mind that someone here is TIL for?

 16:19 <xnox> bdmurray, i think it's just a bug... but would be interesting to check that e.g. software centre doesn't break (it has channels stuff too)

 16:19 <slangasek> bdmurray: huh. is there a way to fix that which doesn't require it to be manually touched for each release?

 16:19 <sil2100> slangasek: not particularily, I already poked on -devel and just wanted to make sure you guys have nothing against that as well ;) It's like ppp, pptpd, fso-gsmd and the like

 16:21 <slangasek> sounds fine :)

 16:22 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:22 <bdmurray> slangasek: I didn't think about it that much yet.

 16:23 <slangasek> bdmurray: ok.  since it has to ship a file within the package that contains the info, I don't see a good way to make it no-touch series neutral.  Could do something with dpkg triggers and update it whenever base-files / distro-data updates... or we could just add it to a list of packages that need to be touched when the archive opens for the cycle

 16:24 <slangasek> the source does seem to already auto-generate the release name, so it only needs an upload to get the right name

 16:25 <bdmurray> roger

 16:26 <slangasek> should probably be recorded on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewReleaseCycleProcess

 16:27 <slangasek> #endmeeting
