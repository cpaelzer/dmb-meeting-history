 20:31 <ahoneybun> #startmeeting 20 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:31 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Jul  7 20:31:59 2016 UTC.  The chair is ahoneybun. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:32 <ahoneybun> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:32 <ahoneybun> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:32 <ahoneybun> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:32 <ahoneybun> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:32 <ahoneybun> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:32 <popey> hello all

 20:32 <popey> hi fossfreedom

 20:32 <fossfreedom> hi popey

 20:34 <ahoneybun> thanks!

 20:34 <ahoneybun> do we have anyone speaking for fossfreedom today?

 20:35 <sethj> me!

 20:35 <ahoneybun> you have the floor sethj

 20:36 <sethj> I've known fossfreedom for about 4 years now, since I joined Ask Ubuntu. He has always been very friendly, helpful and super knowledgeable.

 20:36 <ahoneybun> nice

 20:36 <sethj> He does an amazing job as a moderator there in addition to his many many answers.

 20:37 <toddy> yes, I see. He is very activ.

 20:37 <popey> woah thats some rep on AU

 20:37 <popey> puts mine to shame!

 20:37 <fossfreedom> :)

 20:37 <ahoneybun> over 1000 answers

 20:37 <sethj> oh yes. He's also the highest reputation user :D

 20:38 <wxl> O_O

 20:38 <ahoneybun> any questions from the board?

 20:38 <popey> I like that you have posts from 5 years ago as "top answers" - that to me alone says "sustained and significant", given you're still contributing 5 years later

 20:38 <popey> I have a question.

 20:39 <popey> fossfreedom: since your recent mail to the tech board about the budgie remix, how have your plans changed for that remix?

 20:40 <fossfreedom> haven't really changed.  Taking things on board.  Working with Debian to get the key packages into Debian (then sync with 16.10) - so far got 3 out of 4 in.  Working with Jeremy Bicha for the remaining.

 20:40 <popey> Oh that's excellent news. Exactly what I wanted to hear

 20:40 <popey> Jeremy is great, and getting the packages in Debian is totally the right way to go, good work!

 20:40 <popey> No more questions from me.

 20:41 <wxl> having a bit of trouble finding info. is budgie c++?

 20:41 <fossfreedom> its Vala based.  Upstream have announced this week that will intend to recode in C (clang)

 20:41 <wxl> neat

 20:42 <ahoneybun> cool stuff

 20:42 <wxl> as a flavor contributor, i'm excited :)

 20:42 * toddy notes that he want to test budgie remix.
