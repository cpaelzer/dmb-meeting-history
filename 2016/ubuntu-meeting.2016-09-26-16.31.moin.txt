 16:31 <tyhicks> Thank you for your assistance in keeping Ubuntu users secure! :)

 16:31 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:31 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:32 <jdstrand> hey

 16:32 <jdstrand> last week I focused a lot on the docker interface, ancillary interface/backend reviews and getting the docker snap to work on classic. The interface is merged and I syncd with stakeholders to get an updated docker in the store.

 16:32 <jdstrand> Also did a lot of PR reviews, updated the dbus-app interface and discussed the unity8 interface with ted

 16:33 <jdstrand> snap-declaration assertions in the review tools and other review tools updates

 16:33 <jdstrand> iterate on the dbus-app interface (hopefully, waiting for PR feedback)

 16:33 <jdstrand> PR reviews, especially wrt /run/media and udisks2

 16:33 <jdstrand> continue to investigate what a 'network-namespace' interface might look like

 16:33 <jdstrand> few more policy updates and policy bugs to look at

 16:33 <jdstrand> snap-declaration assertions in the review tools and other review tools updates

 16:33 <jdstrand> oh, I repeated one of those. it's that important :)

 16:33 <jdstrand> that's it from me

 16:33 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:33 <mdeslaur> I'm on triage this week

 16:33 <mdeslaur> I'm currently working on an embargoed issue

 16:33 <mdeslaur> and I have samba and clamav updates ready for testing

 16:34 <mdeslaur> that's about it, sbeattie, you're up

 16:34 <sbeattie> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:34 <sbeattie> I made progress on some apparmor reviews last week, and will finish those up

 16:34 <sbeattie> I have kernel signoffs to get through today

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'll try to pick up an update from the list as well

 16:35 <sbeattie> that's it for me, tyhicks?

 16:36 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:36 <tyhicks> I'm trying to do SRU verification (LP: #1580463) (LP: #1614215)

 16:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1580463 in im-config (Ubuntu Xenial) "Snap blocks access to system input methods (ibus, fcitx, ...)" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1580463

 16:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1614215 in apparmor (Ubuntu Xenial) ""md5sums differ" message seems to indicate an install problem" [Low,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1614215

 16:36 <tyhicks> jdstrand: it looks like im-config was removed from xenial-proposed :/

 16:36 <tyhicks> jdstrand: could you re-upload and I'll handle the SRU verification?

 16:37 <tyhicks> after that, I'll be back on trying to bring AppArmor UNIX domain socket mediation back to 14.04 + hardware enablement kernel

 16:37 <tyhicks> I hit a blocker last week and I'm now taking a different approach

 16:37 <tyhicks> I have some packaging changes to make today so that we continue to ship the 14.04 policy in the backported 16.04 package

 16:37 <tyhicks> then I'll be testing

 16:37 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:38 <tyhicks> sbeattie: either you or I need to look at bug #1627304 this week

 16:39 <ubottu> bug 1627304 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "User locking problems - guest login crashing" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1627304

 16:39 <sbeattie> tyhicks: okay

 16:39 <tyhicks> sbeattie: I can get to it mid-week and will let you know if/when I start working on it

 16:39 <tyhicks> I think jj isn't around just yet

 16:39 <tyhicks> sarnold: are you here?

 16:40 <tyhicks> chrisccoulson: go ahead

 16:40 <chrisccoulson> I've got a minor Oxide update to do this week. There aren't any planned Mozilla updates

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> I've got a few Oxide code reviews to get through too

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> Also, Firefox and Thunderbird fail to build on various architectures in yakkety, so I need to spend some time on that

 16:41 <chrisccoulson> Other than that, I'll be working through Oxide bugs as usual

 16:42 <tyhicks> thanks chrisccoulson

 16:42 <tyhicks> ratliff: you're up

 16:42 <ratliff> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:42 <ratliff> I'm finalizing the pillow update

 16:43 <ratliff> Design doc review and other internal tasks to complete

 16:43 <ratliff> back to you, tyhicks

 16:44 <tyhicks> thanks!

 16:47 <sarnold> lets hope lukasz fixes the ftbfs :)

 16:47 <sarnold> it sounded promising but he mentioned silos and I lost track

 16:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1617005 in zmqpp (Ubuntu) "[MIR] zmqpp" [Undecided,New]

 16:48 <tyhicks> sarnold: might be worth kicking that build off while looking at ubuntu-terminal-app :)

 16:48 <tyhicks> does anyone have anything else?

 16:49 <sarnold> heh, ubuntu-terminal-app doesn't even show up in umt search :/

 16:49 <tyhicks> I'm confused by that one

 16:49 <tyhicks> maybe ratliff can get you more info?

 16:49 <ratliff> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-terminal-app/+bug/1625074

 16:49 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1625074 in ubuntu-terminal-app (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ubuntu-terminal-app" [High,Confirmed]

 16:50 <ratliff> the code is in launchpad and linked to off of that MIR

 16:51 <tyhicks> lets discuss this outside of the meeting so that everyone else can go about their day
