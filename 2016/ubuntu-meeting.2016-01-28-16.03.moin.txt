 16:08 <bdmurray> installed / setup Ubuntu on new laptop

 16:08 <cyphermox> pitti: (we removed biosdevname in 14.04.3 for much of the same thing)

 16:08 <bdmurray> âœ” done

 16:08 <xnox> tdaitx, well it's a special fosdem beer location, with extra special beers and tokens.

 16:08 <slangasek> pitti: speaking of armhf and scalingstack, did you happen to see the post from hrw a few weeks ago about "how I got 32-bit arm VMs running right"?

 16:09 <pitti> cyphermox: err, no, we didn't -- biosdevname is still used in d-i in latest netboot

 16:09 <pitti> slangasek: uh, no, I didn't.. showmeshowmeshowme!

 16:09 <cyphermox> maybe I'm mistaking it for some other release then

 16:09 <pitti> slangasek: I was talking to wgrant about that and made some experiments, but there were still some hiccups

 16:09 <slangasek> pitti: https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2016/01/17/running-32-bit-arm-virtual-machine-on-aarch64-hardware/

 16:09 <doko> bdmurray, any proposed action on 1534374?

 16:09 <slangasek> this is on Fedora, but hopefully translates

 16:10 <pitti> slangasek: oh, that way around -- I tohught you meant "boot armhf images in scalingstack"

 16:10 <xnox> bug 1534374?

 16:10 <xnox> bug 1534374

 16:10 <bdmurray> doko: wait for Vivid to End of Life

 16:10 <slangasek> pitti: well, but it should be bootable in scaling stack if we get the pieces figured out :)

 16:10 <pitti> bdmurray: what is "DSE", OOI?

 16:10 <doko> bdmurray, I like that

 16:10 <bdmurray> pitti: data stack enterprise

 16:11 <pitti> will vivid actually EOL? I thought touch releases are still based on vivid

 16:11 <bdmurray> pitti: cassandra w/ support and bells and whistles

 16:11 <sil2100> Oh crap

 16:12 <slangasek> * uplift edk2 to new upstream snapshot per request of hyperscale team

 16:12 <slangasek> * ppc64el triage for 14.04.4

 16:12 * sil2100 is obviously very late but still needs time to prepare his report

 16:12 <xnox> sil2100, are you not looking forward to vivid builders getting turned off? =)

 16:12 <slangasek> (done)

 16:12 <chiluk> LP #1535349.  Patch created waiting on sponsorship.  Discovered an additional issue with initramfs-tools that will need to be resolved before this is fully fixed.

 16:12 <chiluk> LP #1484696.  Fix Released issue closed.

 16:12 <chiluk> Xenial issues with pulseaudio rejecting connections in xenial.  Daemon is still up, but not responding.  Case to be found or reported.

 16:12 <chiluk> Xenial issues where chrome does not respond to dbus url open requests.

 16:12 <chiluk> --done--

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1535349 in coreutils (Ubuntu Trusty) "`df /dev/sda1` no longer reports information for /dev/sda1" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1535349

 16:12 <pitti> slangasek: you can actually create an AMI with the kernel/initrd and boot the armhf cloud image -- but that fails on some libvirt issue (which wgrant already dealt with by backporting the fix) and some scalingstack config issue

 16:12 <tdaitx> sil2100: aim to go right after infinity, he is last on the list ;-)

 16:13 <doko> - binutils 2.26 release

 16:13 <doko> - gcc-5 ibm backports

 16:13 <doko> - icedtea-web update, build for openjdk-8

 16:13 <doko> - fix firefox build on arm64

 16:13 <doko> - getting gcc cross packages mostly installable

 16:13 <doko> - ruby2.2 update

 16:13 <doko> - openjdk-6, openjdk-9 uploads

 16:13 <sil2100> tdaitx: thanks

 16:13 <doko> - work on python3.4 removal

 16:13 <doko> - work on ruby2.1 removal

 16:13 <doko> - some work on multiarchifying packages

 16:13 <barry> slangasek: oh?  where's that discussion happening?

 16:13 <doko> (done)

 16:13 <pitti> slangasek: uh, no "main" closure on b-deps any more? that sounds a bit strange

 16:13 <xnox> barry, slowly being worked on ;-)

 16:14 <slangasek> barry: it's been internal discussion up to this point, I'll post on ubuntu-devel shortly about it

 16:14 <barry> just curious if there's a public thread on it?

 16:14 <barry> oh cool

 16:14 <xnox> pitti, it's not as weird as it sounds. as vastly smaller in scope.

 16:14 <slangasek> it's in the same general vein as Archive Reorg has always been - "security support over the binary dep closure, not over the source dep closure"

 16:15 <pitti> xnox: "Go static linking"

 16:15 <xnox> pitti, and C++ templates

 16:15 <slangasek> we just found a shortcut to the implementation

 16:15 <xnox> pitti, are two things to watch out for, yes.

 16:15 <slangasek> pitti, xnox: Built-Using

 16:15 <xnox> slangasek, oh, ok.

 16:15 <slangasek> i.e. we should still be closed over Built-Using, just not over Build-Depends

 16:15 <pitti> so if we render main packages unbuildable because of some universe crap nobody cares about, we make our lifes even harder

 16:16 <slangasek> xnox: your turn

 16:16 <slangasek> pitti: happy to make this a discussion topic later in the meeting :)

 16:16 <robru> Does anybody know if it's possible to start an lxc from inside a schroot?

 16:16 <xnox> robru, we are in a meeting =)

 16:16 <xnox> working on fixing cloud images (borked link_in_boot)

 16:16 <xnox> working on publishing updated installer guide

 16:16 <xnox> fixed .ins and el torito boot files

 16:16 <xnox> packaged libica

 16:16 <xnox> upgraded btrfs tools, to fix bugs on ppc64el

 16:16 <xnox> attended openmainframe project eu meetup in luton

 16:16 <xnox> off to fosdem tomorrow

 16:16 <xnox> etc.

 16:16 <xnox> done

 16:16 <slangasek> robru: a chroot by itself has no namespacing; so yes it should be possible as long as you have all the right mounts in the chroot

 16:17 <barry> sla claws-mail: merged w/debian, uploaded 3.13.1-1.1ubuntu1 and 3.13.1-1.1ubuntu2 (the latter to fix upstream bug #3600)

 16:17 <ubottu> bug 3600 in Launchpad itself "Summary field processing is handling carriage returns wrongly." [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/3600

 16:17 <barry> dirtbike/pip stack: everything working in my local staging environment.  now i need to 1) release dirtbike & upload to debian; 2) upload python-progress (debian bug #812908); 3) update debian python policy for wheels; 4) update pip to 8 & upload.  it was lots of work, but it's all paying off now and will make ongoing maintenance *much* easier, and will finally get us a much more modern pip.  next up: virtualenv

 16:17 <ubottu> Debian bug 812908 in wnpp "ITP: python-progress -- easy progress reporting for Python" [Wishlist,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/812908

 16:17 <barry> worked on the foundations-x-python3-only blueprint.  samba-libs is still the big blocker.  reached out to the fedora porter who has made some progress, but still a lot of work to do.  this one has me the most worried.

 16:17 <barry> i won't wait for the debian gnome maintainers much longer on libpeas.  if nothing happens in debian by the end of next week's sprint, i'll move forward in ubuntu.

 16:17 <barry> --done--

 16:18 <pitti> sil2100: no infinity, go

 16:18 <sil2100> o/

 16:18 <doko> barry, is there an open issue?

 16:18 <sil2100> - Landing team work, silo coordination, preparing landing e-mails

 16:18 <sil2100> - RTM Status meetings

 16:18 <sil2100> - system-image:

 16:18 <sil2100> * Coordinating the removal of manta images from official s-i

 16:18 <sil2100> * Poke community s-i hosts to pick up manta once we remove those

 16:18 <sil2100> * Tests tests

 16:18 <barry> doko: on libpeas?

 16:18 <sil2100> - Promoting devel images

 16:18 <doko> yes

 16:18 <sil2100> - OTA-9:

 16:18 <sil2100> * Preparing release notes

 16:18 <sil2100> * Releasing the images (with some complications due to management miscommunication)

 16:18 <sil2100> * Investigating various reports

 16:18 <sil2100> - Future OTA schedule preparation, announcements

 16:18 <sil2100> - Multiple secret work involving device enablement in s-i

 16:18 <barry> doko: yes, let me find it

 16:18 <sil2100> - Preparing a new merge for ppp, symbols changes needed

 16:18 <sil2100> - Help in preparing silo 12 landing, packaging reviews etc. (a big PD-related silo)

 16:18 <sil2100> - OTA-9.5

 16:18 <sil2100> * Planning and scheduling, various long discussions

 16:18 <sil2100> * Add new frameworks to the seeds and store

 16:19 <sil2100> - Landing-team-tools - write a helper script for getting s-i image information

 16:19 <sil2100> (done)

 16:19 <robru> slangasek: what are the right mounts? It has /proc and /dev/pts

 16:19 <slangasek> sil2100: congrats on OTA-9

 16:19 <sil2100> Thanks, some people do seem to have issues with seeing the update though, will have to look into that a bit

 16:19 <sil2100> Since the phasing ended like 6-8 hours ago

 16:19 <pitti> slangasek: so yes, that's using direct kernel boot much like I attempted on scalingstack; this should work in principle indeed

 16:20 <sil2100> But yeah, in overall it's good :)

 16:20 <barry> doko: LP: #1440504 which has a link to the debian bug

 16:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1440504 in libpeas (Ubuntu) "libpeas-1.0-0 depends on both libpython2.7 and libpython3.4" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1440504

 16:20 <barry> doko: debian bug has patches

 16:20 <slangasek> robru: I don't know all of them, but there'll be at least /sys and I think there's at least one other mount needed for the cgroups

 16:20 <slangasek> (but I have no cgroups fs mount on my system currently, hmmm)

 16:20 <slangasek> maybe that's old info

 16:21 <caribou> o/

 16:21 <caribou> sorry I'm late

 16:21 <slangasek> pitti: ah, direct kernel boot; that's obviously less than perfect, but I guess it's the only option we have there

 16:21 <pitti> slangasek: tmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup ?

 16:21 <pitti> slangasek: it's what the blog uses too

 16:21 <slangasek> pitti: oh haha I was looking at mounts inside a chroot, so there

 16:22 <slangasek> caribou: hi! anything you'd like to report?

 16:22 <caribou> yep

 16:22 <caribou> LP1522346 - nut merge

 16:22 <caribou> LP1536904 - kdump fails on 16.04

 16:22 <caribou> LP1537714 - smaller initrd for older kernels

 16:22 <caribou> Sponsorship : LP1089013 - clvm

 16:22 <caribou> Sponsorship : LP1248054 - dlm

 16:22 <caribou> and rework of my  home network

 16:22 <caribou> (done)Ã 

 16:22 <slangasek> caribou: thanks for nut, I'm glad to no longer be TIL on it ;-)

 16:23 <slangasek> now that just leaves me shadow <cough>

 16:23 <caribou> oh, & looks like there will be another rsyslog merge needed

 16:24 <slangasek> I can also give a status update for infinity

 16:24 <robru> slangasek: so is it enough to just bindmount from the host into the chroot? Where's the documentation on everything lxc needs?

 16:24 <slangasek> * working on glibc 2.22 merge and reconciling locales packages with Debian

 16:24 <cyphermox> slangasek: I mean to merge shadow

 16:24 <slangasek> robru: I don't know; possibly somewhere near the lxc package

 16:25 <slangasek> cyphermox: oh? but I'm TIL :)

 16:25 <xnox> robru, try stgraber ?

 16:25 <xnox> =)

 16:25 <cyphermox> slangasek: ah, I can leave it to you then ;)

 16:25 <slangasek> cyphermox: maybe you want to merge console-setup instead, you already have your name down on that one on merges.u.c :)

 16:25 <slangasek> ok, any questions on status?

 16:26 <cyphermox> slangasek: yeah, that one too

 16:26 <slangasek> [TOPIC] Archive Reorg

 16:27 <slangasek> since there were questions about this, let's discuss

 16:27 <slangasek> pitti: you had concerns about uncared-for packages in universe

 16:28 <doko> cyphermox, ohh, I started shadow, but lost track. while the debian maintainer took most patches, they are disabled, and need an update

 16:28 <pitti> slangasek: well, yes; mostly about rendering more main packages FTBFS and thus making it harder to remove obsolete universe packages

 16:28 <cyphermox> doko: ok.. I mentioned it because you asked me about a shadow upload to trusty :P

 16:29 <pitti> but also with all the static linking madness of go, where build deps are really binary deps

 16:29 <slangasek> pitti: so the reality today is that we spend a lot of effort going through the MIR process for these same packages, pulling them into main

 16:29 <slangasek> and then we still don't do anything with them because they're not actually interesting, they're only needed as build-dependencies

 16:30 <slangasek> I expect this to be a net reduction in work effort, because a) less MIR paperwork for things we don't care about and don't want to support, b) less packaging delta from Debian to enforce a build-time main/universe split, c) fewer packages in main overall meaning less security team work

 16:30 <xnox> pitti, my thoughts were that packages that main build-depends on, will become known as "supported-build-depends" hosted mostly in universe. And then we can implement controls and/or additional policy on that. For example, uploads only by core-dev, rather than motu.

 16:30 <slangasek> this btw was always part of the ArchiveReorg plan, which we first discussed back in Barcelona :)  It only foundered on some of the implementation details

 16:31 <xnox> pitti, (where supported-build-depends is a seed)

 16:31 <pitti> slangasek: oh yeah, that's the other thing -- we have some packages where we drop build deps to drop functionality which is only available with universe b-deps, for building plugins for example

 16:31 <slangasek> xnox: fwiw I don't see any reason to restrict uploads to core-dev

 16:31 <xnox> slangasek, ok.

 16:31 <pitti> slangasek: you'd have the same delta if they end up being binary deps (new library), or an invisible "static linking" case when they don't become build-deps

 16:31 <slangasek> pitti: static linking of go MUST be tracked already via the Built-Using field, which I mentioned above

 16:31 <xnox> pitti, yeah. and e.g. especially when those plugins, will be published into universe anyway. We already do build a lot packages in main, that have some binary packages in universe.

 16:31 <doko> cyphermox, feel free to take over

 16:32 <slangasek> hmmm I wonder if this would actually cause python2 to drop out of main in 16.04 ;)

 16:32 <cyphermox> doko: *shrugs* I will finish console-setup first, I already have it in a PPA ready to finish testing

 16:33 <xnox> slangasek, i wonder if "built-using" should be included in main closure then (whereas "build-depends" will not)

 16:33 <barry> slangasek: wouldn't that be wonderful? :)

 16:33 <xnox> slangasek, ubuntu-desktop depends on python2 at the moment.

 16:33 <slangasek> pitti: the forcing function for 16.04 is nodejs.  This is something the security team will *not* be providing support for, yet it's pulled in as a build-dependency for documentation

 16:33 <slangasek> xnox: sorry, that's exactly what I meant

 16:33 <xnox> slangasek, ack.

 16:34 <barry> xnox: see my previous comments about samba-libs :(

 16:34 <slangasek> xnox: Built-Using should be included in main (and therefore component-mismatches should report on it), Build-Depends should not

 16:34 <slangasek> pitti: but there are other examples besides nodejs; maven has been one this cycle as well, with its many tentacles of java

 16:35 <slangasek> yes, if the build-dependency translates to a binary dependency, we still have to deal with it

 16:35 * barry will be happy to drop some debian deltas because of this

 16:35 <slangasek> but the reason for ArchiveReorg is the recognition that there are many packages that are in main only because they're build-dependencies and *not* runtime dependencies (or statically-linked)

 16:35 <pitti> well, I can't say I have a good feeling about this, but maybe that's just me then

 16:37 <slangasek> pitti: it'll reduce the workload, trust me ;-)

 16:37 <pitti> slangasek: oh, no doubts about that, I'm more afraid of piling up hidden traps

 16:37 <slangasek> hmm, well

 16:38 <slangasek> the kind of trap you've mentioned - bitrotting package in universe - is still something we'd be responsible for sorting out, in either case

 16:38 <barry> slangasek, xnox it would be nice to have some high level archive spelunking tooling around this.  e.g. given a package, tell me the status of all its b-d and depends.  or going the other way, given a package, tell me the status of its reverses

 16:38 <xnox> barry, that would be check-mir =)

 16:38 <slangasek> i.e. if it's a build-dep, we're responsible for sorting out the bitrot; it doesn't matter if that package is in main like today, or if we move it to unvierse

 16:38 <xnox> barry, we are still keeping main/universe components

 16:39 <slangasek> xnox: well, we need to stand up a modified component-mismatches and germinate

 16:39 <pitti> slangasek: right, but so far we've just dropped the build-dep of "meh, don't like that" stuff beforehand, instead of letting them creep in everywhere

 16:39 <barry> xnox: something like that, probably with some enhancements

 16:39 * xnox really should share my draft document with everybody.

 16:39 <pitti> so this will undoubtedly work well initially; my fear is that it will make it harder down the road, as we effectively end up maintaining half of universe

 16:40 <pitti> maven, haskell, what not

 16:40 <xnox> but we already do

 16:40 <slangasek> I disagree that this means we will be maintaining maven or haskell

 16:41 <xnox> e.g. haskell transitions, java transtions it's still we do anyway.

 16:41 <slangasek> except to a very basic level

 16:41 <xnox> a healthy main, requires a somewhat healthy universe.

 16:41 * xnox was writting down my thoughts on the subject in a google doc -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJBtLLCppH2yt664S8G2jB_tK-iWi_D7wqaN6S4ddwI/edit#

 16:42 <slangasek> xnox: have you checked past archive reorg documentation in the wiki already?

 16:42 <xnox> slangasek, i've read and re-read most of it. And it is confusing.

 16:42 <slangasek> \o/

 16:43 <xnox> slangasek, cause parts were implemented, and other parts are not (e.g. we did permissions, but we didn't abolish components)

 16:43 <xnox> slangasek, and this new "supported-build-depends" subject, i'd rather not call "archive-reorg", as the scope is smaller.

 16:43 <xnox> e.g. we are keeping M.I.R. and we are keeping a show-case pinacle "main" component.

 16:44 <slangasek> we were always going to be keeping an MIR process

 16:44 <xnox> and kicking things out of it, that are not pinacle show-case stuff =)

 16:44 <slangasek> it was just a question of whether the includer was still called "main"

 16:44 <xnox> slangasek, well yes. But the whole apt preferences shananigans were nuts.

 16:44 <slangasek> heh

 16:45 <xnox> my plan was to generate sample new seed output, sample new components missmatches, polish the document

 16:46 <xnox> and like seek further feedback

 16:46 <xnox> but i guess the cat is out of the bag now.

 16:46 <slangasek> don't worry, you'll get all the feedback you need ;)

 16:46 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:46 <slangasek> anything else today?

 16:47 <slangasek> I have a small proposal to replace the Linux kernel in main with Hurd

 16:47 <barry> *hurt

 16:47 <cyphermox> slangasek: pff

 16:47 <cyphermox> I'd rather you pick Darwin.

 16:47 <slangasek> heh

 16:47 <sil2100> ;)

 16:48 <caribou> nah, keep it & rewrite in Go

 16:48 <xnox> slangasek, +1 on Darwin

 16:48 <barry> that'll dovetail nicely with my plans to rewrite go in guile

 16:48 <tdaitx> stuff I didn't have time to write: I will be off tomorrow and from Wed to Frid next week (swap day + vacation), and then the week after on Monday and Tuesday (holidays); moved from hexchat to quassel so now I can have it connected most of the time (just in time for some time off)

 16:48 <xnox> barry, using an llvm compiler right?

 16:48 <slangasek> Mir 3.0, now with DisplayPostscript support

 16:49 <barry> xnox: of course!

 16:49 <xnox> slangasek, \o/

 16:49 <xnox> slangasek, requires a type-c dongle?

 16:49 <cyphermox> xnox: DisplayPostscript is over CP only

 16:49 <slangasek> tdaitx: oh good, enjoy the scrollback then ;)

 16:50 <xnox> cyphermox, i have no idea what CP is - is that available on a mainframe?

 16:50 <tdaitx> yeah, as if the email backlog is not enough ;-)

 16:50 <cyphermox> xnox: I suppose. Carrier Pidgeon?

 16:50 * barry fires up his old NeWS server
