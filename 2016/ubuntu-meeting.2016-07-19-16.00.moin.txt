 16:00 <coreycb> #startmeeting ubuntu-server-team

 16:00 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Jul 19 16:00:20 2016 UTC.  The chair is coreycb. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 16:00 <meetingology> 

 16:00 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:00 <teward> o/

 16:00 <powersj> o/

 16:00 <coreycb> Just going to hang tight for a few minutes and let people show up

 16:01 <jgrimm> o/

 16:01 <rbasak> o/

 16:02 <smb> o/

 16:02 <nacc> o/

 16:02 <coreycb> alright looks like we have a decent number of folks so let's get started

 16:02 <rharper> o/

 16:02 <coreycb> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:03 <nacc> sorry, i'm bad and haven't updated the wiki; i think there was just hte one for jgrimm to review the qemu bug(s)

 16:03 <coreycb> nacc, ok jgrimm do you have status on that?

 16:03 * jgrimm goes looking for the bug

 16:04 <jgrimm> coreycb, ask me again during free discussion, i'll have looked up what the bug is by then

 16:04 <coreycb> jgrimm, ok sounds good

 16:05 <coreycb> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:05 <coreycb> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule

 16:05 <nacc> jgrimm: https://launchpad.net/bugs/1561019

 16:05 <jgrimm> thanks nacc

 16:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1561019 in libvirt (Ubuntu) "copied cpu flags don't match host cpu" [Medium,New]

 16:05 <coreycb> Alpha 2 is in 9 days

 16:05 <coreycb> And we're about a month away from Feature Freeze

 16:07 <teward> nginx is probably going to get a merge for Yakkety, it'll include the dynamic modules that Debian adds.  Test packages are being built on my side now, then in a PPA, and a call for testing install/upgrade will go out

 16:07 <coreycb> keep feature freeze in mind  as new features and new packages will need FFEs after that point

 16:07 <teward> assuming I don't get another case of the lazies :)

 16:07 <teward> that should land for Yakkety then before FeatureFreeze

 16:07 <teward> ('tis all for me today)

 16:07 <coreycb> thanks teward

 16:08 <coreycb> anything else for yakkety development?

 16:08 <jgrimm> otherwise, generally... merges and bugs have been making good forward progress

 16:08 <coreycb> jgrimm, great

 16:09 <coreycb> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <coreycb> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-x-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:09 <coreycb> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:09 <jgrimm> coreycb, i'll jump in here with status on bug 1561019 action item

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1561019 in libvirt (Ubuntu) "copied cpu flags don't match host cpu" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1561019

 16:10 <jgrimm> hallyn and smb seems to be making progress on that atm.  my action was to find someone to work on it.. so done. :)

 16:10 <coreycb> jgrimm, :)

 16:11 <smb> yeah... ugly

 16:11 <smb> jgrimm, thought that was actually worked around

 16:12 <jgrimm> smb, fair enough

 16:13 <jgrimm> smb, my response was about action item i took last week, to make sure someone took a look at it.

 16:13 <smb> jgrimm, guess at some point I'd have to check whether this was actually pused anywhere

 16:13 <jgrimm> smb, ack!

 16:13 <coreycb> as for other bugs, based on a quick scan, it looks like all the high importance bugs have someone from the server team who's been working on them or communicating at least

 16:14 <coreycb> and some triage is needed for others

 16:14 <coreycb> does anyone have anything else for bugs?

 16:15 <coreycb> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:15 <coreycb> hey caribou

 16:15 <jgrimm> coreycb, unable to attend today

 16:15 <rbasak> caribou sends his apologies

 16:15 <coreycb> apology accepted

 16:15 <coreycb> :)

 16:15 <coreycb> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team

 16:16 <jgrimm> powersj, ^^

 16:16 <powersj> Working with IS to get Jenkins updated to latest LTS version due to a known Jenkins defect, cpaelzer and I are meeting re: 390, and pinged IS on getting torkoal (baremetal system) added and up to Jenkins.

 16:16 <powersj> Turning focus back to Jenkins CI and integration jobs for cloud-init while waiting on Jenkins fix and slave additions.

 16:17 <coreycb> powersj, thanks for the update.  any questions for powersj?

 16:18 <coreycb> alrighty, on we go

 16:18 <coreycb> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:18 <smb> No news, sorry (at least no bad news).

 16:19 <coreycb> smb, ok thanks

 16:19 <coreycb> smb, same story for the other kernel folks?

 16:19 <smb> likely

 16:19 <arges> yup

 16:20 <coreycb> alright thanks guys

 16:20 <coreycb> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:20 <coreycb> jumped the gun. any questions for kernel folks?

 16:25 <coreycb> rharper, what's your talk on?

 16:25 <rharper> fire-side chatting about containers and lxd

 16:26 <coreycb> rharper, awesome

 16:26 <coreycb> #topic Open Discussion

 16:27 <coreycb> jgrimm, did you want to discuss that libvirt bug?

 16:27 <coreycb> or was it qemu bugs

 16:28 <jgrimm> coreycb, we already covered it during release bugs

 16:28 <jgrimm> alll good

 16:28 <coreycb> jgrimm, ah, that was it.  good so no actions to carry over as far as I can tell.

 16:29 <jgrimm> agreed!

 16:29 <coreycb> jgrimm, I still owe you a reply on your email about subscriptions to openstack packages

 16:30 <coreycb> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:30 <coreycb> the next meeting will be the same time next week

 16:30 <jgrimm> coreycb: james took care of it

 16:31 <coreycb> jgrimm, oh, great, thanks jamespage!

 16:31 <coreycb> gaughen is up next week to chair

 16:31 <jgrimm> coreycb, indeed.. i owe him (yet another) beer for his kindly assistance. :)

 16:31 <gaughen> coreycb, I will be at the sprint

 16:31 <coreycb> gaughen, ok

 16:32 <coreycb> next in line is arosales, smoser, rbasak.  any of you not at the sprint next week?

 16:32 <jgrimm> smoser or rbasak should be around

 16:32 <coreycb> jgrimm, alright, it'll be one of them

 16:32 <coreycb> #topic Assigned merges/bugwork (rbasak)

 16:32 <rbasak> o/

 16:32 <coreycb> o/

 16:33 <rbasak> I've been doing some catching up

 16:33 <rbasak> I've mainly been focusing on unblocking existing assignments right now.

 16:33 <rbasak> cpaelzer isn't here, but AFAICT he's mainly blocked on me reviewing his ntp and dovecot merges, so I'll get on with those ASAP.

 16:33 <arosales> coreycb: I am at sprint next weeek

 16:34 <rbasak> (I sponsored a ton of uploads today, more tomorrow)

 16:34 <arosales> rbasak: or smoser could I trade with you?

 16:34 <rbasak> jgrimm and rharper, I think you should be unblocked?

 16:34 <jgrimm> rbasak, i am! thank you

 16:34 <coreycb> arosales, yep it's going to be one of them. I'll nag them.

 16:34 <rharper> rbasak: yes, just need to work the bugs you've assigned

 16:34 <rbasak> nacc, your only assignment right now is the bacula thing according to my sheet. I think I'm waiting on you to tell me when you're ready for upload. Is that right?

 16:34 <arosales> coreycb: smoser rbasak thanks :-)

 16:34 <nacc> rbasak: yep, i think we're pretty close

 16:35 <nacc> rbasak: i need to verify the yakkety changes are good again (some stuff got sent to debian)

 16:35 <rbasak> magicalChicken: around? I've been catching up on your bugs, I think some probably need unassigning perhaps.

 16:35 <nacc> rbasak: did you get a chance to look at hte puppet bug?

 16:35 <rbasak> nacc: OK, I'll wait for you, thanks.

 16:35 <nacc> rbasak: LP: #1570472

 16:35 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Yeah

 16:35 <rbasak> nacc: not in detail, sorry I didn't reply to the puppet bug yet. I'm reluctant though. I don't understand why we can't invert the logic using existing functionality.

 16:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1570472 in puppet (Ubuntu) "Set systemd as default service provider" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1570472

 16:36 <rbasak> magicalChicken: where are we with bug 1394403 right now please?

 16:36 <ubottu> bug 1394403 in apache2 (Ubuntu Trusty) "RewriteRule of "^$" is broken" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1394403

 16:36 <nacc> rbasak: oh we could; but upstream has already taken that change; it won't affect the SRU -- and upstream may chagne the logic altogether (they're working on adding a new extension that may allow for calling arbitrary conditional functions

 16:36 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Still unable to reproduce with the first patch that went in

 16:37 <nacc> rbasak: but if we change first, then we're diverging from upstream's change, which seems less than ideal

 16:37 <nacc> rbasak: i agree with you for 16.10

 16:37 <nacc> rbasak: i disagree with you for 16.04 :)

 16:37 <nacc> rbasak: if that makes sense :)

 16:37 <magicalChicken> rbasak: I did LP: #1534538, but I need to redo it because a security update went into repos first

 16:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1534538 in apache2 (Ubuntu Trusty) " AliasMatch directive does not accept long URI" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1534538

 16:37 <rbasak> nacc: right, but we need to fix 16.10 first for the SRU. And I don't want to upload a change I know will be broken in three months.

 16:38 <nacc> rbasak: ok, i'll work on upstream then

 16:38 <rbasak> nacc: I'd be happy for us to fix Yakkety with a temporary delta that we know is right, even if that isn't upstream.

 16:38 <rbasak> nacc: unless that's particularly awkward? Then that would unblock the SRU.

 16:38 <nacc> rbasak: right, i was thinking the opposite direction, but the same result

 16:38 <rbasak> nacc: otherwise we're defeating the object of fixing development rist.

 16:38 <rbasak> first

 16:39 <nacc> rbasak: in that, yakkety gets the current fix, and then i fix upstream and yakkety

 16:39 <nacc> rbasak: fix the fix, i guess

 16:39 <nacc> rbasak: either way, one delays the sru more :)

 16:39 <nacc> rbasak: and takes more of my time :-P

 16:39 <rbasak> I'm not sure I follow.

 16:39 <nacc> rbasak: i have to learn ruby :)

 16:39 <rbasak> What I'm asking for is to fix Yakkety and then to fix Xenial. The Xenial fix can be minimal.

 16:39 <nacc> well, enough ruby :)

 16:40 <rbasak> I'm sayingi that the Yakkety fix must not be known broken, but it can be a delta.

 16:40 <rbasak> Is that OK?

 16:41 <rbasak> If upstream are planning a big picture fix, then the Yakkety delta can also be minimal I think.

 16:41 <rbasak> As long as it's not autombroken.

 16:42 <nacc> rbasak: well, given that i'm the one who will probably have to fix upstream; that's what i was trying to say. I will work on fixing upstream and yakkety. But the fix we have now, which is minimal, works for both, right now. The future fix will just be future-proof (which doesn't matter for the current releases). But I will just work on it instead of yammering furhter

 16:42 <rbasak> magicalChicken: for 4403, it's not clear to me that you can't reproduce from reading the bug.

 16:42 <rbasak> magicalChicken: am I missing something, or else could you please update the bug?

 16:42 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Sure, I'll redo the verification and post logs

 16:43 <magicalChicken> I had been able to reproduce before the first patch I submitted, but after that patch the duplicate rewrite message isn't present in apache's log

 16:43 <rbasak> magicalChicken: sorry, I don't follow. What do we need to do to resolve the bug?

 16:44 <rbasak> Are we stuck because unreproducible?

 16:44 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Yes. I had submitted a patch earlier that fixed it for me, but the user said that it did not fix it for them

 16:44 <rbasak> magicalChicken: but the user has since provided a reproducer, right?

 16:45 <magicalChicken> rbasak: I posted logs of me running the test case they provided with the patch in place, and the bug doesn't show up in them

 16:45 <magicalChicken> rbasak: I haven't heard from the user since then

 16:45 <rbasak> Sorry, I know I'm confused here.

 16:45 <rbasak> Ah, OK.

 16:45 <rbasak> I think I follow. I didn't read your comment as there being a problem.

 16:45 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Right yeah, I need to rewrite that to clarify

 16:45 <rbasak> OK, thanks.

 16:45 <magicalChicken> I'll go ahead and try to reproduce 1 more time too

 16:46 <rbasak> I saw the security team trump your progress in 538.

 16:46 <rbasak> Can I leave that to you to redo, please?

 16:46 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Sure, it shouldn't take long, it was a simple patch

 16:47 <rbasak> OK, thanks!

 16:47 <rbasak> magicalChicken: next, in bug 1511222, it looks like the reporter hasn't replied.

 16:47 <ubottu> bug 1511222 in apache2 (Ubuntu Trusty) "Incorrect trusted proxy match test in mod_remoteip" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1511222

 16:47 <rbasak> magicalChicken: would you prefer to drive it anyway and SRU verify yourself, or drop it?

 16:48 <rbasak> It looks like only one person has reported affected since October.

 16:48 <rbasak> So I don't mind which you prefer - depends on your confidence in the fix and your view on the impact of the bug on other users.

 16:48 <magicalChicken> rbasak: I had tested out the patch and it worked okay for me. I can go ahead and rerun that test and post the logs. I don't think the user is going to reply

 16:48 <rbasak> magicalChicken: OK, so would you like to continue with landing the fix, or forget about it until someone replies?

 16:49 <magicalChicken> rbasak: It might be good to wait for someone to reply, since I may have been wrong about a patch working on the RewriteRule bug earlier

 16:50 <magicalChicken> rbasak: If anyone else reports they're affected, I can ask them to test out the patched version and see if it fixes it for them

 16:50 <rbasak> OK, that's fine. Please could you note this in a comment on the bug, and then I'll treat it as unassigned? If you could stay subscribed in case the user does reply, that would be helpful.

 16:50 <magicalChicken> Sure, thanks

 16:50 <magicalChicken> Yeah, I'll pick it up again if anyone replies to it

 16:51 <rbasak> magicalChicken: OK great! Next, bug 1296835 needs SRU verification. Are you planning on doing that, or is the bug stalled because you're waiting on a reporter to do it?

 16:51 <ubottu> bug 1296835 in pptpd (Ubuntu Trusty) "status_of_proc lacks a "-p" in /etc/init.d/pptpd" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1296835

 16:52 <magicalChicken> rbasak: I can go ahead and do the verifiction for that

 16:52 <rbasak> OK great. Thanks!

 16:52 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Thanks

 16:53 <rbasak> Almost there :)

 16:53 <magicalChicken> haha

 16:53 <rbasak> Just one more - any progress on the logwatch bugs please?

 16:53 <rbasak> I realise this is quite a few bugs you have on at once, so no worries if not. Just trying to update my spreadsheet :)

 16:54 <magicalChicken> I hadn't been aware of a logwatch bug

 16:54 <magicalChicken> I can handle that this week, it just had slipped my mind, sorry

 16:55 <rbasak> No worries. It's a whole collection of bugs - various messages. Looks like mostly regexp updates needed, each small individually.

 16:55 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Cool, shouldn't be too hard to get fixed then

 16:55 <rbasak> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/logwatch is the list - I mean the "unmatched" and "not being reported" type bugs.

 16:55 <rbasak> Great. Thank you!

 16:55 <magicalChicken> Thanks

 16:56 <rbasak> magicalChicken: and thank you for your patience. I'm focusing on getting rid of the bugs from my spreadsheet - it's fine if they aren't making progress because of reporter silence - as long as we communicate what they need to do, I'm happy to drop them from my tracking. As long as I can forget about them :)

 16:57 <magicalChicken> rbasak: No problem, I'll stay subscribed to the ones we're waiting on so that I can pick them up again when the reporter replies

 16:57 <rbasak> I'm done for today, thanks all. I think everyone has something to get on with, possibly with the exception of cpaelzer until I unblock him.

 16:57 <rbasak> I intend to triage more this week and get a backlog of assignments again.

 16:57 <rbasak> Any other comments or questions?

 16:58 <nacc> rbasak: feel free to put more on my plate again, i'm mostly caught up now that you've sponsored stuff

 16:58 <rbasak> nacc: thanks. And thank you for all the uploads! I need to do that endorsement :)

 16:58 <rbasak> coreycb: #endmeeting please
