 16:04 <jgrimm> rharper, leave it, i'll do right after meeting

 16:04 <rharper> ok, we'll keep that

 16:04 <rharper> jamespage checking with old iscsitarget users on relevancy with new kernels

 16:04 <jamespage> oh boy

 16:05 <jamespage> better carry that - I need to figure out who to ask

 16:05 <rharper> sure

 16:05 <rharper> powersj to put together iso testing signup sheet

 16:05 <jgrimm> hmm.. that's old

 16:05 <jgrimm> rharper, where are you looking at agenda from

 16:05 <powersj> rharper, yeah - done a while ago ;)

 16:05 <rharper> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20160927

 16:06 <jgrimm> ok, should have been marked done last time. not on wiki at least

 16:06 <rharper> #done powersj to put together iso testing signup sheet

 16:07 <jgrimm> rharper, you are looking at the agenda of last week

 16:07 <jgrimm> by looking at the minutes. :)

 16:07 <rharper> but I was successful, 2/3 still need doing =)

 16:07 <jgrimm> heheheh. indeed!

 16:08 <rharper> ok, I don't see any other actions to review

 16:08 <rharper> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:08 <rharper> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule

 16:08 <rharper> just up to Final Freeze

 16:08 <jgrimm> rush to the finish line

 16:08 <rharper> very much

 16:08 <rharper> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <jgrimm> anything to discuss wrt urgent/critical for freeze?

 16:09 <rharper> maybe, smoser re: the nss/cloud-init/dbus.socket stuff

 16:09 <nacc> down to 4 ftbfs in the test rebuild

 16:09 <jgrimm> cpaelzer got a new upload in today (already in archive) for dpdk, he has some cleanups to do with respect to latest ovs

 16:10 <smoser> bug 1629868

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1629868 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "times out because of no dbus" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1629868

 16:10 <smoser> and bug 1629797

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1629797 in systemd (Ubuntu) "resolve service in nsswitch.conf adds 25 seconds to failed lookups before systemd-resolved is up" [Undecided,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1629797

 16:10 <smoser> are the fun

 16:10 <smoser> they're a result of 2 changes... a.) cloud-init.service now running 'Before=basic.target'

 16:10 <smoser> b.) adding of 'resolv' to /etc/nsswitch.conf in yakkety

 16:11 <smoser> sorry, spelling. resolve

 16:11 <jgrimm> smoser, fix in hand? need help?

 16:11 <rharper> smoser: and (a) was required to ensure cloud-init can mount/unmount devices

 16:11 <rharper> before systemd.mount does

 16:11 <smoser> i'd say *a* fix is possible, but everyone agrees that while being least-intrusive of the options, it seems yucky

 16:12 <smoser> (that fix is to put 'Before=dbus.service' in cloud-init.service, which seems quite counter obvious at first glance)

 16:12 <rharper> indeed

 16:12 <smoser> so, continuing to work that. the good news is it is fairly easily recreatable.

 16:13 <rharper> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:13 <jgrimm> ok, i just read the dbus one.

 16:14 <rharper> any other release items/issues ?

 16:14 <jgrimm> rls-y looks fine

 16:14 <rharper> k

 16:14 <rharper> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:14 <ubottu> bug 1630274 in cloud-utils (Ubuntu) "mount-image-callback may not mount overlay when it could" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1630274

 16:14 <caribou> that's about it

 16:14 <smoser> i need odd_bloke to verify that it works for him, but i expect it to

 16:15 <rharper> any questions for caribou

 16:16 <rharper> thanks caribou

 16:16 <jgrimm> nope, but on the topic, i'm currently working through bugs that have xenial, trusty tasks still in some sort of in-progress state to nudge them along

 16:16 <jgrimm> get owners as needed, etc

 16:16 <jgrimm> that's all

 16:16 <rharper> thanks

 16:17 <rharper> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:17 <powersj> Spent last week at QA sprint with folks from other areas, learned lots. Focusing this week on triage, gathering cloud-init integration test cases, qemu/kvm live migration tests running.

 16:17 <powersj> Server ISO kernel issues got resolved last week (yea!) and size is decreasing nicely. Only waiting on GCC 6 reductions to hopefully get us down below 703 MB (amd64 is at 743 MB today). Post-release will continue analysis of ISO size and contents. /qa_update

 16:17 <rharper> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/
