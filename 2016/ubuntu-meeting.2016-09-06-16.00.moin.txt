 16:00 <rbasak> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:00 <rbasak> cpaelzer and rbasak to review new triaging section in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase

 16:01 <cpaelzer> o/

 16:01 <rbasak> I have reviewed, and I think it looks good. Thanks powersj for cleaning that up!

 16:01 <powersj> np thanks for the review

 16:01 <cpaelzer> I have as well and I liked it pretty much

 16:01 <cpaelzer> I thought on more detail sometimes, but then that would divert attention too much

 16:01 <cpaelzer> the links from there are good for that

 16:02 <rbasak> Thanks cpaelzer!

 16:02 <rbasak> Any comments on Yakkety's progress?

 16:02 <rbasak> I noticed sbuild is broken building Yakkety from Xenial. The easiest fix seems to be to be a no-change backport of sbuild from Yakkety.

 16:03 <jgrimm> for awareness, ibm developers seeking to backport some qemu 2.7 functionality specific to ppc64 into our 2.6

 16:03 <jgrimm> will assess risk/viability once we see the patches

 16:04 <ubottu> Error: Could not gather data from Launchpad for bug #1541902 (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1541902). The error has been logged

 16:04 <rbasak> #info for awareness, ibm developers seeking to backport some qemu 2.7 functionality specific to ppc64 into our 2.6; will assess risk/viability once we see the patches

 16:04 <rbasak> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1541902

 16:04 * rbasak is going to try and have ubottu write the minutes for him this time

 16:04 <cpaelzer> About the same is true if you s/qemu/dpdk/ on jons lines in regard to bug 1539775

 16:04 <ubottu> Error: Could not gather data from Launchpad for bug #1539775 (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1539775). The error has been logged

 16:04 <rbasak> #info sbuild is broken building Yakkety from Xenial; workaround is to no-change backport sbuild from Yakkety

 16:05 <jgrimm> ubottu broken?

 16:05 <ubottu> jgrimm: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

 16:06 <rbasak> #subtopic Active work that may need wider communication

 16:06 <rbasak> Are you doing anything that should be communicated more widely?

 16:06 <cpaelzer> yes

 16:06 <jgrimm> :)

 16:06 <cpaelzer> just a secdon to write here

 16:07 <cpaelzer> I'll come up with a proposal to fix and formalize how we handle qemu machine types, especially in regard to migrations

 16:07 <cpaelzer> I'd ask - if there is anyone out there that had issues in regard to kvm migration recently please contact me

 16:07 <rbasak> #info cpaelzer will come up with a proposal to fix and formalize how we handle qemu machine types, especially in regard to migrations. He asks for anyone who has had issues with kvm migration recently to get in touch

 16:08 <rbasak> Thanks cpaelzer!

 16:08 <rbasak> Anything else?

 16:08 <cpaelzer> I had talked to most internal Teams now and processed old cases, but any extra portion of real life makes such a proposal better

 16:08 <rbasak> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:08 <rbasak> caribou sends his apologies. Does anyone else have anything for this topic?

 16:09 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:15 <powersj> sounds like we are good

 16:15 <rbasak> I think people are self-updating their status now. Are we making progress?

 16:15 <jgrimm> yes, i've updated spreadsheet this week

 16:16 <cpaelzer> all I did in the past week, no new progress yet

 16:16 <nacc> rbasak: i think we are probably in a good place to upload the bacula fixes -- the one person who reported an issue with the PPA has not responded in a few weeks and others have reported successful testing

 16:16 <nacc> rbasak: which would clear several bugs off my backburner

 16:16 <rbasak> nacc: sounds good!

 16:17 <jgrimm> nacc, \o/

 16:17 <rbasak> Thank you for working on that.
