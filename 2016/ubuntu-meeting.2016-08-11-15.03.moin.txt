 15:11 <tdaitx> = OpenJDK security update

 15:11 <tdaitx> - Fixed broken JamVM: 2 new native methods were introduced in sun.misc.Unsafe and had to be implemented in JamVM as well (LP: #1611598); a bug has been reported to both JamVM and IcedTea and fixes have been provided for review

 15:11 <tdaitx> - OpenJDK 8 packages with JamVM seem to be broken as well but jtreg is not being run, working on that

 15:11 <tdaitx> - Waiting for 8u102 backport to be approved on aarch64-port to update the source package

 15:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1611598 in OpenJDK "jamvm is broken due to missing native methods in sun.misc.Unsafe" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1611598

 15:11 <tdaitx> - OpenJDK 7 builds still segfaults on Trusty on Arm64 (but it doe eventually passes); it used to be that building on trusty-security only segfaulted and trust-updates didn't, but now both have the same version; under investigation

 15:11 <tdaitx> (done)

 15:12 <xnox> bug #1612294

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1612294 in systemd (Ubuntu) "Boot messages in /var/log/syslog are out of order and with mostly "useless" timestamp" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1612294

 15:12 <doko> tdaitx, is this with pch enabled? if yes, please can you try to disable that?

 15:14 <slangasek> chiluk: the timestamp is added by the syslog server, which systemd can only dump to once syslog is started

 15:14 <slangasek> so systemd can either send this info or not, but not control the timestamp

 15:14 <xnox> read journal?

 15:14 <chiluk> slangasek: Yeah I'm aware.. doesn't mean I can't bitch about it .. or at least get it documented.

 15:14 <slangasek> ok

 15:15 <slangasek> any questions over status?

 15:15 <infinity> Can't reasonably fix the timestamp thing, but the order is definitely a bug.

 15:15 <chiluk> slangasek ... If there's ever a discussion about switching away from systemd.. this will just be one more bit of ammo.

 15:15 <xnox> do we even have syslog by default? i thought we just use journal, and make that syslog.

 15:15 <slangasek> chiluk: switching away from systemd to what? :)

 15:15 * chiluk misses upstart..

 15:15 * xnox systeme

 15:15 <infinity> xnox: We definitely have syslog.

 15:16 <slangasek> xnox: absolutely not.  we don't bury our logs in a non-standard binary db :)

 15:16 <xnox> ok. I can't tell with my frankenstein machines =)

 15:16 <infinity> slangasek: Of course it's a standard, Lennart declared it thus.

 15:16 * xnox ponders if we should make journal dump plaintext logs and rotate that.

 15:17 <xnox> aka pg_dump for journald

 15:17 <slangasek> orrr we could continue using the perfectly good syslog that we already have infrastructure for

 15:17 <infinity> xnox: And that would be better than a standard syslog interface how?

 15:17 <sil2100> Asking for the last time: anyone against me updating zeromq3 to the latest git snapshot? ;)

 15:18 <infinity> sil2100: So, sorry, I'm only half awake.  You said this was for scopes people, which implies maybe phone work?

 15:18 <infinity> sil2100: Which implies they'd want this in xenial?

 15:18 <sil2100> infinity: yes, actually for ubuntu-personal

 15:18 <infinity> sil2100: s/phone/unity8/ then.

 15:18 <tdaitx> doko, thanks, I will check that

 15:18 <sil2100> Since they need that to get things working for snappy

 15:18 <sil2100> Yeah

 15:19 <infinity> sil2100: If this is only for yakkety *and* a real upstream release is around the corner, then fine.  If this is for xenial, then hahahaha no.

 15:19 <xnox> sil2100, snap zeromq3 ? =/

 15:19 <infinity> Or tell people that relying on features in git isn't really the way forward?

 15:19 <sil2100> I'm prepping it for yakkety right now, don't know anything about xenial - but who knows ;)

 15:19 <sil2100> Anyway yeah, the new version will be out soonish I guess

 15:19 <doko> sil2100, well, if all rdeps work with it ...

 15:20 <xnox> wait they want to put zeromq3 on every client? isn't that a bit heavy weight?

 15:20 <sil2100> No changes in symbols, just a few ones added

 15:20 <infinity> xnox: It's not.

 15:20 <infinity> xnox: It's quite little, in fact, which is the appeal.

 15:21 <xnox> ok.

 15:21 <infinity> xnox: Think of it like the sqlite of the MQ world.

 15:21 <infinity> xnox: An MQ with no engine, just a library and a socket.

 15:22 <slangasek> and incorrect case-insensitive matching behavior? :)

 15:23 <infinity> slangasek: I'm not sure the sqlite analogy extends that far. ;)

 15:23 <xnox> "like sqlite" ?! =)

 15:23 <slangasek> xnox: he didn't say "like couchdb", so it must be ok

 15:23 <infinity> (But it probably has similar failings... The size tradeoff is likely similarly worth it, though)

 15:24 <infinity> So, since we seem to have devolved into AOB, despite a topic change...

 15:24 <infinity> despite a lack of topic change.

 15:25 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:25 <infinity> Has anyone seen bizarre issues on Intel GPUs with an up-to-date yakkety?

 15:25 <sil2100> I'll be on holidays on Monday

 15:25 <infinity> Like, flickering, render tearing, world exploding spectacularly requiring a reboot...

 15:25 <sil2100> I mean, one-day national holiday

 15:25 * xnox points out that Cold Water by Justin Bieber & Make me by Britney Spears are amazing songs

 15:26 <tdaitx> doko, so, I do have your latest patches (from debian's 7u111-2.6.7-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 for arm64 pch) but the build is not using disable-precompiled-headers, I will retry it with that and see how it goes

 15:26 * sil2100 still didn't figure out when to take his holidays

 15:26 <xnox> infinity, define bizarre?

 15:26 <xnox> and desktop / mobile / ultramobile graphics?

 15:26 <bdmurray> infinity: I've seen flickering

 15:26 <xnox> flickering yes.

 15:26 <infinity> xnox: Broadwell-U

 15:26 <xnox> also disable / uninstall flash plugin

 15:26 <cyphermox> secure boot magic win, yay.

 15:26 <xnox> oh the worst of them all.

 15:26 <cyphermox> ^ that was AOB ;)

 15:27 <slangasek> "secure boot magic win"?

 15:27 <xnox> I'm on skylake and it's ok. I don't think Broadwell-U was ever fixed.

 15:27 <cyphermox> https://rol.im/securegoldenkeyboot/

 15:27 <infinity> Alright, if everyone's seeing flickering, I at least know not to assume my laptop is dying.

 15:27 <slangasek> the magic won? you won the magic?

 15:27 <infinity> Now to figure out who to yell at.

 15:27 <cyphermox> nah

 15:27 <cyphermox> there was no magic

 15:27 <cyphermox> and much less won.

 15:27 <xnox> is that just ARM keys, or x86_64 keys too?

 15:27 <slangasek> well, /we/ win, because now we can put Ubuntu on all the Windows ARM devices :)

 15:27 <cyphermox> shrugs

 15:28 <slangasek> xnox: ARM only

 15:28 <cyphermox> I checked, it doesn't include any of our shim hashes

 15:28 <xnox> cause if it is just ARM keys, then it's intentional leak to open up the platform, as microsoft todate refused / didn't sign anybody else for that.

 15:28 <slangasek> uhm

 15:28 <slangasek> conspiracy theory much? :)

 15:29 <cyphermox> I wasn't under the impression this was only ARM though.

 15:29 <infinity> slangasek: Have you met Dmitri?

 15:29 <cyphermox> did the reptilian overlords already get him?

 15:30 * xnox saw new star trek, was very confused about lack of either aliens or predators

 15:31 <barry> xnox: saw it in imax 3d the day it premiered.  still pretty awesome

 15:32 <infinity> xnox: Pretty sure Kirk is a predator.

 15:32 <barry> infinity: only the shatnerkirk

 15:33 <barry> aoaob?

 15:33 <infinity> barry: Nah, the new Kirk is too.  They set that up in the very first movie.

 15:35 <bdmurray> he was even hiding under a bed in that one

 15:35 <barry> shatner would have never hid under a bed

 15:35 <barry> s/would/could/

 15:36 <infinity> That's because Shatner's Kirk lived in a 60s sci-fi world where beds were either welded to the ground or floating 4 feet in the air.

 15:36 <cyphermox> heh. I still have total respect for McCoy, who had the worst job of them all

 15:36 <infinity> cyphermox: McCoy worked on Secure Boot?

 15:37 <cyphermox> no, he cured Kirk's STDs.

 15:37 <infinity> Similar.

 15:37 <cyphermox> that's still a little bit above working on Secure Boot ;)

 15:37 <barry> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pNQYHvhnms

 15:37 <barry> the 60s were so awesome
