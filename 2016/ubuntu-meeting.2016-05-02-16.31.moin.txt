 16:32 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:32 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:35 <jdstrand> hey

 16:35 <jdstrand> sorry

 16:35 <jdstrand> this week I plan to be focusing on snappy

 16:35 <jdstrand> I have some more interface policy additions

 16:35 <jdstrand> more working with glib/gtk/gnome applications

 16:35 <jdstrand> various PRs on new interfaces to review

 16:36 <jdstrand> I hope to get snappy-debug working again in some manner (not the final snappy development implementation though)

 16:36 <jdstrand> if I have time I'll look at the x32 socketcall issue

 16:36 <jdstrand> I'll be attending UOS for some snappy stuff

 16:37 <jdstrand> and have 3 embargoed issues

 16:37 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage this week

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'm about to publish some updates

 16:37 <mdeslaur> and I'm working on an embargoed issue

 16:37 <mdeslaur> and I'll be going down the list after that

 16:38 <mdeslaur> that's pretty much it, sbeattie?

 16:38 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:38 <sbeattie> I also am looking at pie build failures, and trying to monitor for additional failures.

 16:39 <sbeattie> I have libc and openjdk [78] updates to finish testing this week.

 16:39 <sbeattie> That plus the usual kernel cve monitoring will likely consume my week.

 16:39 <sbeattie> tyhicks: over to you

 16:40 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:40 <tyhicks> I'll attend some UOS sessions

 16:40 <tyhicks> I'll be preparing for the snappy sprint next week

 16:41 <tyhicks> there are a few loose ends I need to tie up this week (some patch re-reviews, send fixes for bug #1465724 to upstream, etc.)

 16:41 <ubottu> bug 1465724 in Snappy "net_admin apparmor denial when using Go" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1465724

 16:41 <tyhicks> I have an embargoed issue

 16:42 <tyhicks> I also missed a sponsoring duty last week (bug #1573761) that I'll do today

 16:42 <ubottu> bug 1573761 in mariadb-5.5 (Ubuntu) "USN-2953-1: MySQL vulnerabilities partially applies to MariaDB too" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1573761

 16:42 <tyhicks> sarnold: see that last one ^

 16:42 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:42 <sarnold> oh cool, thanks tyhicks :)

 16:42 <tyhicks> jj is out

 16:42 <tyhicks> sarnold: you're up

 16:42 <sarnold> i'm on community this week

 16:43 <sarnold> I owe responses to xml-security-c upstream

 16:43 <sarnold> i've got a few loose-ends left over from my network fiddling last week

 16:43 <sarnold> and then if there's a light community load this week, return to the MIRs that weren't finished in time for xenial.

 16:44 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson is on holiday, so I think it's back to tyhicks

 16:45 <tyhicks> sarnold: thanks - I think it is important to get back to the MIR list before new ones start rolling in

 16:45 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:45 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:45 <tyhicks> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.
