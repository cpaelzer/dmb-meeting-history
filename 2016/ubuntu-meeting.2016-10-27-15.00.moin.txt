 15:10 <cyphermox> - investigating a possible bug in systemd-resolved's IPv4/IPv6 logic.

 15:10 <cyphermox> - Plumbers next week, travelling on Monday; I'll try to be online whenever possible.

 15:10 <cyphermox> (done)

 15:10 <slangasek> any questions?

 15:11 <slangasek> cyphermox: what's the outlook on having that isc-dhcp rework landed?

 15:11 <cyphermox> isc-dhcp is already uploaded.

 15:11 <cyphermox> it needs the SRU too, but it's simple and relatively safe, considering we reverted the initramfs magic.

 15:11 <cyphermox> and well, initramfs-tools is also in zesty-proposed, waiting for tests.

 15:12 <cyphermox> from there I was hoping jderose could also chime in, say if it looks good to him too.

 15:12 <cyphermox> (but I haven't seen him online recently)

 15:13 <cyphermox> on a very different note, we'll need to talk again about shims and secure boot and moving that forward, including making new keys and stuff.

 15:13 <xnox> AOB NB! europe clocks fall back on sunday; USA clocks fall back the week after; AUS has already sprung forward.

 15:14 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:14 <barry> iow, no meeting will be fully attended until december

 15:14 <pitti> in Athens we were mentioning using britney to land SRUs

 15:15 <pitti> instead of manually doing sru-release and then forgetting about dependencies, broken tests, etc.

 15:15 <slangasek> pitti: yeeeeess pleaaaase :)

 15:15 <pitti> I think it's not actually that hard -- we already have a "7 day age" policy, and we'd just need to add a policy taht checks the verification tags

 15:15 <pitti> is that worth pursuing?

 15:16 <pitti> slangasek: so, something I should look at when I'm not stuck with high-prio bugs? :-)

 15:16 <slangasek> pitti: ah, I have assumed that we would keep the stable releases frozen ('block-all') and require SRU team members to set unblock hints

 15:16 <pitti> slangasek: or that, yes

 15:16 <slangasek> pitti: I don't think we want auto-approval of SRUs based on tags, at least not for the first step

 15:17 <xnox> and britney needs to know to copy things into -updates, rather than release pocket. =)

 15:17 <pitti> slangasek: we actually already do have the block-all, as per e.g. http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/xenial/update_excuses.html

 15:18 <xnox> what about -security, or screw that?

 15:18 <pitti> I just don't have a good idea how the actual copying works -- who would know about that?

 15:18 <slangasek> pitti: yes; we just need to change the tooling to do unblocking, and change proposed-migration to do the actual copying

 15:18 <pitti> xnox: nah, there's no public info for that anyway

 15:19 <slangasek> pitti: cjwatson or infinity are your best bet, but they may have forgotten and you may have to just look at the code :)

 15:19 <slangasek> pitti: I believe 'heidi' is the key word

 15:19 <pitti> yeah, HeidiResultsDelta is the list of "packages to copy", I just don't know where that goes

 15:19 <pitti> well, I'll find out

 15:21 <slangasek> ok, anything else?

 15:22 <slangasek> #endmeeting
