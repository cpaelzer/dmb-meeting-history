 15:02 <slangasek> tdaitx xnox sil2100 slangasek mwhudson infinity cyphermox pitti doko chiluk caribou robru barry bdmurray

 15:02 <slangasek> shall we?

 15:02 <infinity> If you insist.

 15:02 <tdaitx> wow, twice!

 15:02 <tdaitx> Short week: holiday on Wednesday, Sep/07 was Independence Day, time to protest against the "coup" all day (instead of just during the night time)

 15:02 <tdaitx> = proposed migration

 15:02 <tdaitx> - Reported linux-libc-dev headers mismatch between powerpc/ppc64 and all other archs; causes FTBFS on repsnapper (LP: #1619446)

 15:02 <tdaitx> - repsnapper FTBFS fix + workaround (LP: #1619289 and LP: #1619100)

 15:02 <tdaitx> - mozart can be removed, no reverse dependencies (other than it's own lib); reason: requires autoconf 2.13 to regenerate files, generated configure is incompatible with gcc6 (a test fails because g++ -E output is different than gcc5), and it is not being maintained any longer; also, the launchpad page project description is wrong; just kill the poor thing please

 15:02 <tdaitx> - investigated htseq being on hold on -proposed; caused by bcftools FTBFS on i386, powerpc, and s390x (chain dependency: htseq -> python-pysam -> bcftools, where bcftools is a new dependency of python-pysam) (full report LP: #1619530)

 15:08 <slangasek> never mwhudson, I put him in the list to confuse people

 15:08 <infinity> Well done.

 15:08 <infinity> Two day week, due to vacation and national holiday:

 15:08 <infinity> - Caught up on email, and learned a valuable lesson about ignoring mail for 10 days

 15:08 <infinity> - Spinning up more powerpc VMs to better parallelise builds

 15:08 <infinity> Side note: Insomnia had me up all night, so hours might be slightly skewed today and tomorrow (ie: I might need a nap soon).

 15:08 <infinity> Less relevant side note: I've had La Isla Bonita stuck in my head for hours, and it's driving me insane.

 15:08 <infinity> (done)

 15:09 <tdaitx> infinity, and why would they trigger for one build and not another? any way I can emulate that?

 15:09 <pitti> infinity: the Madonna song?

 15:09 <pitti> autopkgtest:

 15:09 <pitti> - Port charms to xenial (mostly upstart â†’ systemd, dropping backport hacks), redeploy production

 15:09 <pitti> - Fully move to python3 (xenial provides py3 libs for swift and nova)

 15:09 <pitti> - Adjust deployment script to work with juju-2.0

 15:10 <pitti> - http://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com: Add back initial statistics page and moderately tasteful homepage

 15:10 <pitti> - Update https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration/AutopkgtestInfrastructure for new web UI code

 15:10 <pitti> distro:

 15:10 <pitti> - Provide deputy system service manager for snapd backport; now mostly working fine, pending testing from tvoss (#1616422)

 15:10 <infinity> tdaitx: It's based on the contents (or existence) of /CurrentlyBuilding.  The docs are the code, unfortunately.

 15:10 <pitti> - systemd: Add systemctl option to wait for unit to become inactive (for convergence-y-replace-upstart)

 15:10 <pitti> - Debug netplan/networkd resolv.conf bug with ogra; prepare SRU (#1620559)

 15:10 <pitti> - Fix resolved handling of multiple trailing dots (#1600000)

 15:10 <pitti> ~~~~ ZE END ~~~

 15:10 <infinity> Der Enden?

 15:11 <slangasek> pitti: "prepare SRU" - of netplan or networkd?

 15:11 <xnox> infinity, there is ginger man spiced latte in starbucks and it's only 107 sleeps until "WHAM!" will hit the charts again.

 15:11 <slangasek> doko_: here?

 15:11 <pitti> slangasek: neither, it's the resolvconf integration with networkd, snappy uses that in xenial

 15:11 <slangasek> ok

 15:11 * xnox is not at cauldron

 15:11 <xnox> =(

 15:12 <robru> pitti: I emailed you, please reply

 15:12 <pitti> slangasek: they currently use their own networkd backport; I guess at some point we should backport that officially, but that should then also get the NM fixes

 15:12 <slangasek> pitti: how close are we to having a netplan we can SRU into xenial?

 15:12 <slangasek> their own networkd backport> ah, eew, yes

 15:12 <slangasek> chiluk: hi

 15:12 <pitti> slangasek: oh, is that urgent? I was going to wait until it at least gets the planned features, and matures a bit

 15:12 <chiluk> sorry slangasek.. dealing with an emergency.

 15:13 <slangasek> pitti: not urgent, I'm just wondering how close we are to it :)

 15:13 <infinity> pitti: And yes, the Madonna song. :P

 15:13 <slangasek> pitti: iterating in the ppa is obviously more efficient than iterating in SRU

 15:13 <chiluk> slangasek skip me please.

 15:13 <slangasek> chiluk: no worries

 15:13 <slangasek> caribou: ?

 15:13 <caribou> I'm here

 15:15 <bdmurray> âœ” done

 15:15 <slangasek> robru: only one successful git landing so far?  slow uptake :)

 15:15 <xnox> caribou, =( is it reproducible now in automated way? do we need archive bisect to pin point it?

 15:16 <robru> slangasek: yeah! I thought people were clamoring for git, but I guess they're busy.

 15:16 <caribou> xnox: no & not sure it's comming from the archive as they used a landscape repositor

 15:16 <pitti> robru: replied

 15:16 <robru> pitti: thanks

 15:16 <infinity> I have a hard time believing dpkg is corrupting its own status file and only one person has noticed.

 15:16 <caribou> xnox: I've been reading dpkg source & trying things

 15:17 <infinity> That's fairly improbable.

 15:17 <caribou> xnox: I'll let you know if I get somewhere

 15:18 <caribou> infinity: it's on precise & happened on >500 desktops at the same time

 15:18 <infinity> caribou: But all in the same environment, so that still qualifies as "one person".

 15:18 <caribou> infinity: and not a corruption per say, 1300 package entries have part of their description field replaced by blanks

 15:18 <infinity> caribou: As in, no one else seems to have seen or reported this in Ubuntu or Debian, so... Hrm.

 15:19 <caribou> infinity: that's why I'm suspecting something on the Landscape Dedicate Server side

 15:19 <infinity> caribou: Copies of their /var/lib/apt/lists would be helpful, if you don't have that.

 15:19 <slangasek> only /part/ of their description field replaced by blanks?

 15:19 <infinity> Could be that they're serving their apt repo over a 110 baud coupler? ;)

 15:20 <caribou> infinity: slangasek: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23150531/

 15:20 <infinity> Description: package for doing things to stu*&^!#%^NO CARRIER

 15:20 <caribou> :D

 15:20 <xnox> slangasek, lines like "  .*" get replaced with " "

 15:20 <xnox> slangasek, that is leading two spaces, in a non-empty line, become empty line

 15:20 <infinity> caribou: Are those actually spaces, or non-printable binary vomit?

 15:20 <xnox> which is invalid format

 15:21 <xnox> slangasek, i somehow suspect something else external to dpkg if fiddling with the status file, does landscape dedicated client does that? or any bindings?

 15:21 <caribou> ^<space><space>$

 15:21 <slangasek> neato

 15:21 <slangasek> are they running dselect?

 15:21 <infinity> If that was apt, I'd say someone's producing bogus Translations-$$ files.

 15:22 <xnox> ah.

 15:22 <infinity> But dpkg status should only have the contents of the actual control files.

 15:22 <pitti> cyphermox: there's still a shim-signed in precise-proposed (http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html), do you know the status of that?

 15:22 <slangasek> xnox: I don't know what might do it

 15:22 <xnox> what if they lack Translations-en ?

 15:22 <infinity> xnox: See above.

 15:22 <cyphermox> pitti: status is it will die, replaced by a newer shinier shim

 15:22 <xnox> on their mirror.

 15:22 <infinity> xnox: Translations-$$ is only used by apt.  dpkg status files are pulled from DEBIAN/control

 15:22 * doko_ waves (without summary) and reminds caribou about the clamav related MIR

 15:22 <cyphermox> but perhaps I should validate it anyway before that

 15:22 <pitti> cyphermox: ok, so not to be released?

 15:23 <caribou> doko_: haven't forgot

 15:23 <xnox> caribou, do we have access to their mirror, over http or some such?

 15:23 <cyphermox> pitti: I'll get back to the bug and look through my notes to be sure, but we'll supercede it anyway

 15:23 <infinity> caribou: Anyhow, interested in as much debugging info as you can get from their apt lists, etc.  Can't make time this week, but I'm quite interested in WTF is going on.

 15:23 <cyphermox> pitti: in any case, I've tested and retested all of this multiple times

 15:23 <caribou> infinity: ok, will keep you posted

 15:23 <pitti> cyphermox: ok; there's one bug missing v-done, but otherwise nothing to say it should be blocked; I want to avoid that it accidentally gets released if it isn't supposed to

 15:24 <caribou> xnox: I'll see what I can get regarding the mirror

 15:27 <cyphermox> pitti: I just checked, it was verification-done for precise too

 15:27 <pitti> cyphermox: not bug 1574727

 15:27 <ubottu> bug 1574727 in shim (Ubuntu Xenial) "[SRU] Enforce using signed kernels and modules on UEFI" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1574727
