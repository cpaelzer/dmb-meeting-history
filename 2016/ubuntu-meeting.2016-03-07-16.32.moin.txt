 16:33 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:33 <tyhicks> jdstrand: you're up

 16:35 <jdstrand> hi

 16:36 <jdstrand> so this week I will be working with the snappy core team on integrating security policies into interfaces

 16:36 <jdstrand> I also plan to work on security policies for snappy on classic

 16:37 <jdstrand> I have 2-3 embargoed items I'm working on

 16:37 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:37 <mdeslaur> I'm currently testing a django regression fix for the regression fix that I'll be publishing today

 16:37 <mdeslaur> hopefully we won't require a regression fix for the regression fix for the regression fix

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I have an embargoed issue I'm working on

 16:38 <mdeslaur> and I plan on going down the list after that

 16:38 <mdeslaur> I'm on bug triage too

 16:38 <mdeslaur> that's about it

 16:38 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:38 <sbeattie> I'm on cve triage this week

 16:39 <sbeattie> I'll also be going through the more recent pie-rebuild test results, and prepping fixes where needed.

 16:40 <sbeattie> I have an update that's been sitting on the back burner that I need to get off my plate

 16:40 <sbeattie> that'll probably consume my week

 16:40 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: what update?

 16:40 <sbeattie> pillow

 16:40 <mdeslaur> ah, I think there's been another CVE for that, in case you weren't aware

 16:41 <sbeattie> It was assigned after the fact, but I'd pulled the fix in for it initially

 16:41 <mdeslaur> oh, cool

 16:41 <tyhicks> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:41 <sbeattie> I stalled out on one of the patches not backporting cleanly, and then the tests to confirm things had changed drastically.

 16:42 <sbeattie> tyhicks: I'm done

 16:42 <tyhicks> thanks

 16:42 <tyhicks> I'm focused on AppArmor stacking again... specifically finishing the regression tests for stacking

 16:42 <tyhicks> I think that'll wrap up all of the userspace changes required to land stacking

 16:43 <jdstrand> \o/

 16:43 <tyhicks> and we hope to land the stacking changes late this week so that'll take some time, as well

 16:43 <tyhicks> I'm still trying to get time to fix the eCryptfs parallel copy file corruption bug (LP: #1543633)

 16:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1543633 in eCryptfs "Data corruption during parallel file copying with interruptions" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1543633

 16:43 <tyhicks> and I have an embargoed issue

 16:44 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:44 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:45 <jjohansen> I am focused on AppArmor stacking as well. specifically working through the rather long list of issues that remain

 16:46 * jjohansen is not as confident as tyhicks of landing it late this week

 16:46 <tyhicks> I'm not necessarily confident but that's the goal :)

 16:47 <jjohansen> that is going to take all week, and if by some miracle it doesn't then I will work on updating the upstream trees, and chasing some of the outstanding bugs

 16:47 <jjohansen> sure, I just wanted to point out I am more pessimistic :P

 16:47 * jjohansen is done sarnold you're up

 16:49 <sarnold> heh if we're aiming at landing stacking this week it feels like we all out to be writing tests .. oof

 16:50 <sarnold> I'm on community this week; i'm working on the fwupd mir first, then .. hmm, I forget the name of the next one on the list

 16:50 <sarnold> i'd also like to poke along a feature freeze exception for libvirt's zfsonlinux support

 16:51 <sarnold> and I'll try to review the apparmor stacking patches ^^ when it makes sense

 16:51 <tyhicks> golang-websocket-dev is the next MIR on the list

 16:51 <sarnold> aha, thanks :)

 16:51 <sarnold> it's also a short week for me

 16:52 <sarnold> that's it for me, chrisccoulson?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> I've got Firefox and Oxide updates to do this week. I shall also (hopefully) be sponsoring Chromium updates

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> I spent some time last week debugging performance issues on Freiza. I don't plan to spend any more time on that this week, which means I can hopefully crack on with convergence work in Oxide

 16:53 <chrisccoulson> That's me done :)

 16:54 <tyhicks> thanks chrisccoulson :)

 16:54 <tyhicks> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:54 <tyhicks> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.
