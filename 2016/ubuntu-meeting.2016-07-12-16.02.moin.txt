 16:04 <caribou> nacc: do you remember the clamav git tree issue ?

 16:04 <nacc> caribou: off the top of my head, no :)

 16:04 <nacc> caribou: was that the one that went backwards in the publishing history?

 16:04 <caribou> nacc: neverming

 16:05 <nacc> caribou: :)

 16:07 <nacc> (note i fixed the wiki irccommands page, which still had -w as the link)

 16:07 <rbasak> Sorry, I've been focused entirely on MySQL. I'm coming out of that hole now. I'm coming out of that hole now though. I hope to catch up on reviews and sponsoring this week.

 16:07 <nacc> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-y-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:08 <caribou> rbasak:  I can upload clamav if it can help

 16:08 <nacc> rbasak: as we had discussed earlier, i'll try and at least help with the reviews; have you had a cahnce to push your import-linter?

 16:08 <rbasak> nacc: no, I should do that. Sorry.

 16:08 <nacc> rbasak: np; just want to make sure we're on the same set of tools

 16:08 <cpaelzer> looking at the bugs, there are two new libvirt bugs - who is looking at them atm - smb?

 16:09 <rbasak> nacc: pushed

 16:10 <nacc> rbasak: thanks!

 16:11 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, are you looking at y or x report? wrt to your libvirt question

 16:11 <cpaelzer> x

 16:11 <cpaelzer> I havent read the details, just checked the new/unassigned ones and seeing two libvirt

 16:12 <cpaelzer> bug 1571209

 16:12 <nacc> i think that's LP: #1561019 and LP: #1571209

 16:12 <nacc> :)

 16:12 <cpaelzer> yes

 16:12 <jgrimm> second one has definitely been around awhile

 16:12 <nacc> I believe hallyn had looked at the cpu flags one

 16:12 <nacc> jgrimm: i think that's the one i was mentioning to you before as to whether someone should pick it back up

 16:12 <jgrimm> ah, ok will look at it offline

 16:13 <jgrimm> give me an action

 16:13 <jgrimm> to check whether it needs some assigned t

 16:13 <nacc> if nothing else, moving on

 16:14 <nacc> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:14 <caribou> been quite busy with four kdump-tools bugs on s390x & ppc64el

 16:14 <caribou> hoping to SRU them shortly

 16:14 <nacc> caribou: all related to that reworking? or new bugs?

 16:15 <caribou> nacc: bug fixed in yakkety mostly & one new bug

 16:15 <nacc> caribou: ah ok

 16:15 <caribou> so SRU for all of them

 16:15 <nacc> caribou: do you have a good testing environment across all the arches for kdump/kexec (and all the myriad of combinations for backing storage)?

 16:15 <caribou> I can list them here if needed

 16:16 <caribou> nacc: short answer : no :)

 16:16 <nacc> caribou: heh :)

 16:16 <nacc> was just wondering

 16:16 <caribou> I've been working on DEP8 tests but they're to unstable to be pushed to the archive

 16:16 <caribou> they all require forcing a kernel crash and qemu tends not to be able to recover correctly, hence blocking the test

 16:17 <nacc> yep, makes sense

 16:17 <jgrimm> caribou, very nice

 16:17 <caribou> oh, and one new upstream sosreport release

 16:17 <caribou> that's all I have

 16:18 <caribou> still want the bug numbers ?

 16:18 <nacc> i guess it doesn't hurt to record them

 16:18 <caribou> LP: #1571590 LP: #1568952 LP: #1599561 LP: #1570775

 16:21 <powersj> quick qa update: ppc64 vm is working now after resolving proxy issues with IS. Curtin ppc64 can now be run on it. I manually modified the jenkins tests, but need to go back and update it through Jenkins Job Builder today.

 16:21 <powersj> Quickly looking at curtin-vmtest failure (403) that has gone on since March and then will start looking at cloud-init-ci work.

 16:21 <nacc> powersj: oh sorry!

 16:21 <nacc> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team

 16:21 <nacc> powersj: great to hear!

 16:22 <powersj> thx would also still like to meet with folks to ask questions and gather thoughts

 16:22 <nacc> powersj: i think you're always welcome to ask on IRC and on the ML (or here, tbh)

 16:25 <nacc> alright, thanks everyone!

 16:25 <nacc> teward: oh did you want to bring up any nginx stuff?

 16:25 <teward> nacc: all detailed in my blog post, but for the future we're going to have to track mainline again

 16:25 <teward> just for the radar: it's for the openssl problems seen in Debian

 16:26 <teward> and it's a tricky merge - call for testing in a week on the ML if anyone wants to test

 16:26 <nacc> teward: ok, thanks for the update!

 16:26 <nacc> #endmeeting
