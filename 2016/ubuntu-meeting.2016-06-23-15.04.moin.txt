 15:17 <slangasek> pitti: which reviews are you currently blocking on for network yaml?

 15:18 <slangasek> pitti: arm64 scalingstack capacity> what's the outcome of that discussion / next steps?

 15:18 <pitti> slangasek: mostly making sure that lool is fine with the current rev; rharper and smoser gave me some ok on IRC (just didn't add a comment in the doc table)

 15:18 <slangasek> ok

 15:18 <pitti> ok, was going to do that on mumble, but let's do it here

 15:18 <pitti> the box only has 22 cards in the 42 slots, so plenty of space

 15:18 <pitti> and estimation is 4 new carsd

 15:18 <pitti> cards

 15:18 <pitti> for autopkgtesting

 15:19 <infinity> Or... 20? :)

 15:19 <slangasek> tdaitx: trusty> heh.  Is xenial available if you request it?

 15:19 <pitti> I spoke to William, he spoke to James; this is apparently a bit sensitive, but James said the best thing to do would be to file an RT as normally

 15:20 <tdaitx> slangasek: I did request it if it was available, got Trusty, so I am assuming they don't - anyway, I'm looking into lxd setup on Trusty as I have tested my stuff on Xenial's lxd

 15:22 <slangasek> ok weird :)

 15:23 <slangasek> alright, any other questions?

 15:24 <slangasek> seems not

 15:24 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:24 <slangasek> Anything else this week, then?

 15:25 <bdmurray> I'll be out on Friday.

 15:25 <sil2100> I want to be partially out on Friday

 15:25 <sil2100> ;)

 15:25 <slangasek> I'll be in on Friday!

 15:26 <cyphermox> I'll be out on Friday. It's the official Quebec drinking beer holiday.

 15:26 <bdmurray> "the official"? is there only one?

 15:26 <cyphermox> (and I am not kidding, although this isn't how it's called)

 15:26 <slangasek> all the others are non-statutory beer drinking

 15:26 <infinity> Í'll be hanging with a doctor for part of Friday.

 15:26 <cyphermox> all the others are optional beer; may be other stuff.

 15:27 <infinity> But not drinking, sadly.

 15:27 <infinity> And xnox will be having his UK citizenship stripped and getting deported on Friday.

 15:27 <cyphermox> for instance, since next Friday is Canada day, it's also "moving" day for many people, so in a sense, pizza and beer day? ;)

 15:27 <infinity> Busy day for all.

 15:27 <slangasek> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Jean-Baptiste_Day

 15:27 <slangasek> baptism by beer?

 15:28 <cyphermox> we know how to roll.

 15:28 <slangasek> infinity: will xnox have a brunch in a brasserie to celebrate brexit?

 15:29 <infinity> slangasek: I may have misread that as brunch in a brasier.

 15:29 <cyphermox> o.O?

 15:29 <slangasek> #endmeeting
