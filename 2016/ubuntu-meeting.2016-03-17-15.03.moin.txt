 15:12 <pitti> cyphermox: do you have a rough eta for landing NM?

 15:12 <pitti> we should give that a few weeks testing in devel at least

 15:13 <cyphermox> not really. I'm fighting gdbus, and I think other things have priority than updating software, like fixing big bad ugly bugs.

 15:13 <pitti> bdmurray?

 15:13 <cyphermox> NM is my off-hours work late at night

 15:13 <slangasek> doko said he would miss this meeting

 15:13 <slangasek> (said he would send status by email, though I don't see it yet)

 15:22 <slangasek> xnox: "a little electricity"? did IS send you a bill for the DC?

 15:26 <bdmurray> where'd that meeting leader go?

 15:27 <slangasek> ok, any other questions?

 15:27 <slangasek> bdmurray: single threaded blocked waiting to hear about electric bills

 15:27 <xnox> slangasek, i was told i was using 80% of electric for a week or so.

 15:27 <slangasek> blink

 15:28 <xnox> slangasek, openstack crashed, and kept crashing =)

 15:28 <slangasek> well then

 15:31 <cyphermox> yeah, that one

 15:31 <pitti> done

 15:31 <xnox> =)))))

 15:31 * infinity is waiting for xnox to go on an IRC diet and drop some of those chins.

 15:31 <slangasek> πηγούνια

 15:32 <slangasek> not to be confused with begonia

 15:32 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:32 <slangasek> anything else today?

 15:33 <slangasek> xnox: at least we didn't decide that holding it in Greece means it needs to be a marathon instead of a sprint

 15:33 <xnox> infinity, actually i have lost 5kg since new years.

 15:33 <bdmurray> slangasek: slashd emailed the SRU team about an openipmi SRU that nobody has comment on. Maybe some SRU team member here could?

 15:33 <xnox> slangasek, awwww

 15:34 <slangasek> bdmurray: it's currently in my backlog, fwiw; I noticed he mentioned it was a private bug, so not a proper SRU bug...

 15:34 <infinity> xnox: Your emoticon hasn't.

 15:34 <bdmurray> slangasek: there is a corresponding public one

 15:34 <slangasek> ah ok

 15:34 <bdmurray> bug 1546735

 15:34 <ubottu> bug 1546735 in openipmi (Ubuntu) "openipmi package compile without SSL" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1546735

 15:35 <slangasek> bdmurray: pretty sure the short answer is going to be "no", anyway

 15:36 <bdmurray> slangasek: okay

 15:36 <infinity> The answer was already no.

 15:37 <infinity> 16 days ago.

 15:37 <slangasek> infinity: oh, did someone already nack this once? ok

 15:37 <infinity> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openipmi/+bug/1546735/comments/4

 15:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1546735 in openipmi (Ubuntu) "openipmi package compile without SSL" [Undecided,Fix released]

 15:37 <bdmurray> "is probably unsuitable" doesn't sound like no to me

 15:37 <infinity> well, it also came with him denying the SRU tasks.

 15:37 <slashd> infinity, slangasek, bmurray, after this comment, RAOF suggest to filed the private bug with compelling argument

 15:38 <infinity> Is the compelling argument "someone's paying us"?

 15:38 <slangasek> slashd: well, the arguments need to be made in public

 15:38 <infinity> ie: why is this private?

 15:38 <slangasek> any argument that can't be made in public is not compelling for an SRU, as infinity's question suggests

 15:38 <slashd> it is private, because I wanted to hide the UA customer from the public bug

 15:39 <slashd> UA customer identity

 15:39 <infinity> So, that becomes more interesting, certainly.

 15:39 <slangasek> the SRU team probably doesn't need to know that at all, but the justification for the SRU does need to be public

 15:39 <infinity> But "I pay for a support contract" doesn't get you carte blanche to dictate the distro either.

 15:39 <infinity> If it did, we'd never get anything done.

 15:40 <infinity> So, yeah.  We need reasonable technical arguments and test plans to prove nothing regresses, yada yada.

 15:40 <ogra_> but we would be immensely rich !

 15:40 <slangasek> anyway, seems like something we can follow up on via the bug

 15:40 <slangasek> bug(s)

 15:40 <slangasek> anything else?

 15:40 <xnox> ogra_, i don't think so. mark would be rich, maybe, or like break even.

 15:41 <slashd> infinity, slangasek, bmurray thanks for your feedbacks on this bug

 15:41 <slashd> much appreciated

 15:41 <xnox> huh.

 15:41 <xnox> slangasek, infinity - why would we not backport something from xenial to trusty?

 15:41 <xnox> slashd, there is commercial product listed in the original bug report as it is.

 15:42 <infinity> xnox: Because it's a stable release?

 15:42 <xnox> slashd, upgrade to xenial is the answer? =)

 15:42 <bdmurray> xnox: the debian bug report has a good test case w/o a commercial product iirc

 15:43 <bdmurray> "solterm is basically useless" seemed like something worth fixing to me

 15:44 <infinity> Not disagreeing, but the SRU bug is more than lacking the usual justification and test bits.

 15:46 <slangasek> ok - further discussion to the bug, then?

 15:46 * infinity nods.
