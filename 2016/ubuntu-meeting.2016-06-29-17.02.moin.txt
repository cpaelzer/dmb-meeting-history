 17:03 <gnuoy> #subtopic gnuoy move meeting to openstack-meeting channel

 17:03 <cargonza> o/

 17:03 <gnuoy> YEs, well we're here, so I haven't

 17:03 <cholcombe> o/

 17:03 <cargonza> gnuoy, it seems that this timeslot is filled by another meeting in the openstack-meeting channel.. just an fyi...

 17:03 <gnuoy> #subtopic gnuoy to update testing for multi-release upgrade testing

 17:04 <gnuoy> cargonza, ah. ok, thanks for the info

 17:04 <gnuoy> I'll probably do the testing update as part of the 16.07 prep tbh

 17:04 <gnuoy> #topic State of Development for next Charm Release

 17:04 <gnuoy> SSL layer stuff mostly landed.

 17:04 <thedac> DNS HA landed \o/

 17:04 <gnuoy> \o/

 17:05 <gnuoy> tip top

 17:05 <tinwood> \o/

 17:05 <cargonza> nice!

 17:05 <icey> woot

 17:05 <gnuoy> Keystone v3 support for the dashboard up for review. Interestingly to get it to work I had to add a relation from the dash to the db

 17:06 <gnuoy> Ah, on that subject does anyone know of an Openstack charm which has some logic like:

 17:06 <gnuoy> If config option A is enabled then Relation X is needed

 17:06 <gnuoy> I need to reflect that in the workload sttaus code ^

 17:06 <tinwood> Strangely, I've done that with Barbican and the hsm for testing.

 17:06 <thedac> Can that be expressed in a context?

 17:07 <gnuoy> thedac, yes it could

 17:07 <gnuoy> I guess thats my answer

 17:07 <gnuoy> thanks

 17:08 <gnuoy> Oh, and we need Openstack upgrade support to get into the layers before 16.07

 17:08 <thedac> also, Apparmor profiles are a WIP

 17:08 <gnuoy> ah, yes

 17:08 <gnuoy> #topic Release Bugs

 17:08 <gnuoy> #link https://goo.gl/HJjORI

 17:09 <gnuoy> not much shift there, lets try and get that number down for next week

 17:09 <gnuoy> #topic Open Discussion

 17:10 <gnuoy> Anyone got anythong they'd like to openly discuss?

 17:10 <thedac> I think the topic submission for Openstack Summit is coming up quick

 17:10 <gnuoy> Right, we need ideas

 17:11 <coreycb> o/

 17:11 <gnuoy> I wonder if we could do some 101 sessions for Juju?

 17:11 <thedac> good idea. Make it official

 17:12 <thedac> And an openstack specific charming session

 17:12 <gnuoy> yeah

 17:12 <coreycb> those are good ideas

 17:12 <coreycb> do we know when the deadline is?

 17:12 <gnuoy> We need an sriov session but I don't have the background for that tbh

 17:13 <thedac> July 13th according to beisner

 17:13 <cargonza> nfv/sdn specifics also??

 17:13 <coreycb> thedac, ok

 17:14 <gnuoy> I guess nfv and sriov would probably go together

 17:14 <thedac> #link https://www.openstack.org/summit-login/login

 17:14 <thedac> strangely that is the correct link ^^

 17:16 <gnuoy> ok, well any ideas lets collate them even if you don't end up doing the talk

 17:16 <gnuoy> anymore items?

 17:17 <gnuoy> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 17:17 <gnuoy> same time, same place (maybe) and tinwood is down to chair

 17:17 <tinwood> okay, sounds good.

 17:17 <gnuoy> #endmeeting
