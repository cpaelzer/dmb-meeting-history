 14:31 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:31 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Aug 18 14:31:09 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:31 <meetingology> 

 14:31 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:31 <didrocks999> hey

 14:31 <cpaelzer> jamespage: didrocks999: ddstreet: sarnold: doko (is away) - ping to start

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:32 <cpaelzer> Old ACTION - cpaelzer to ask Steve how to fastpath font packages without subscriptions

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I have done that and he agrees with Doko that at least a subscriber must be present - but not the full process

 14:32 <cpaelzer> I ammended our entry at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess?action=show&redirect=MIRTeam#Font_Packages to reflect that

 14:32 <cpaelzer> TL;DR - font packages with pure data need no MIR process, but a subscriber then an AA can promote

 14:33 <didrocks> (as I was away: was there any argument against the last font package, it was just waiting on the subscription IIRC)?

 14:33 <cpaelzer> no argument against it

 14:33 <cpaelzer> just waited on the subscription

 14:33 <cpaelzer> but we used the chance to formalize this aspect

 14:33 <didrocks> ack

 14:33 <cpaelzer> another action of last week(s) was around khronos-opencl-clhpp

 14:33 <cpaelzer> seb_128 could you carry https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/khronos-opencl-clhpp/+bug/1636728 to the Desktop Team meeting then to sort out who should subsceribe now

 14:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1636728 in khronos-opencl-clhpp (Ubuntu) "[MIR] khronos-opencl-clhpp" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:33 <cpaelzer> seb_128 agreed (we said and have seen the same last week) - but since the old owner was ubuntu-x it would be Dekstop to punt it over to kernel

 14:33 <cpaelzer> seb was so kind to help last week, this week didrocks = seb128 :-)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> And welcome back :-)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> So didrocks, did this reach the team and will it be handled?

 14:34 <didrocks> I did ping seb128 before going on holidays, he says he will track it because he was unsure the desktop team should be the subscriber

 14:34 <cpaelzer> oh yeah

 14:34 <cpaelzer> we agreed to that

 14:34 <cpaelzer> we did that, we did again with seb and so on

 14:35 <cpaelzer> but someone has to do the nudging of the kernel team to take it (as they own the package depending on it)

 14:35 <didrocks> so, it’s all handled it seems, no? I don’t see it on mismatch

 14:35 <cpaelzer> oh did it vanish

 14:35 <cpaelzer> well let's do mismatches

 14:35 <didrocks> looks like it :)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> then we will see

 14:35 <didrocks> yeah

 14:36 <cpaelzer> until then the rest will have woken up - re-ping jamespage: ddstreet: sarnold:

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:36 <sarnold> good morning

 14:36 <cpaelzer> didrocks: no it still is in mismatches-propsoed

 14:37 <cpaelzer> there are still plenty of things we know to be on jamespage shoulders to clarify for the openstack context

 14:37 <cpaelzer> and there is a golang explosion as well

 14:37 <didrocks> I don’t see it :/

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:37 <cpaelzer> to the right of cups and left of lintian

 14:38 <didrocks> it’s khronos-opencl-clhpp here between cups and lintian

 14:39 <cpaelzer> didrocks: which is the package I asked the desktop team to punt to the kernel

 14:39 <didrocks> cpaelzer: ah, sorry I was still on the font package from 3 weeks ago

 14:39 <cpaelzer> :-)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> no that one is done

 14:39 <didrocks> so, we were not talking about the same thing

 14:39 <didrocks> sorry :)

 14:39 <cpaelzer> np

 14:39 <cpaelzer> the de-confusion is what the meegin is for

 14:39 <didrocks> hehe, right

 14:40 <cpaelzer> take a look at the MIR that is linked and help to resolve it beofre next week if that is ok for you

 14:40 <didrocks> will do

 14:40 <didrocks> do we know about the golang-google-api, what is pulling it?

 14:40 <didrocks> (ack, the other one was the bug you subbed me but I didn’t manage to catch that back up still)

 14:40 <cpaelzer> u-boot, lintian was for foundations,  paramiko/masakari  were on james page

 14:41 <cpaelzer> what is left are the golang things for google*

 14:41 <cpaelzer> didrocks: it seems the source is gce-compute-image-packages

 14:42 <didrocks> that would make sense

 14:43 <cpaelzer> this was also mentione din the +1 reports

 14:43 <cpaelzer> for archive cleanup

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I know that at least rbalint and mwhudson touched bits of it on +1 duty

 14:43 <cpaelzer> at least one will be in our list of new bugs

 14:43 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/google-guest-agent/+bug/1891929

 14:43 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891929 in google-guest-agent (Ubuntu) "[MIR] google-guest-agent" [Undecided,New]

 14:44 <cpaelzer> we will catch that in the next sub-topic

 14:44 <didrocks> I’m happy to have a look at that one ^

 14:44 <cpaelzer> that would be perfect

 14:44 <cpaelzer> we have assigned a bunch last weeks and everyone was pretty busy getting those donw

 14:45 <cpaelzer> didrocks: could you tkae an extra look if that is related (or not) to the golang-google-api that shows up

 14:45 <didrocks> cpaelzer: sure

 14:45 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:45 <didrocks> if we need it, then, we’ll have a tree of golang packages to look at :p

 14:46 <cpaelzer> next week we are nearing feature freeze there we need to bring those up as bugs

 14:46 <didrocks> yeah

 14:46 <cpaelzer> we might need to open bugs and assign to teams to decide if they want to own or kill the dependency

 14:46 <cpaelzer> so understanding the source of the deps would be awesome

 14:46 <didrocks> I’ll have a look, I have some spare time for that this week

 14:46 <cpaelzer> ok, at least no other issue in mismatches than those

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> well we just assigned https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/google-guest-agent/+bug/1891929

 14:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891929 in google-guest-agent (Ubuntu) "[MIR] google-guest-agent" [Undecided,New]

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I'll do so on the bug

 14:47 <cpaelzer> all the oem-* things are special cased

 14:48 <didrocks> I thought no MIR were required?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> next normal one is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-airscan/+bug/1891682

 14:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891682 in sane-airscan (Ubuntu) "[MIR] sane-airscan" [High,New]

 14:48 <cpaelzer> didrocks: the OEM things need a bug to document and the AAs to check a defined set of constraints

 14:48 <cpaelzer> no MIR process on these

 14:48 <didrocks> ack

 14:48 <cpaelzer> do you think you could also tkae on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-airscan/+bug/1891682 didrocks?

 14:49 <didrocks> will be a busy MIR week, but let’s do that before FF :)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:49 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:50 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tlp/+bug/1888656

 14:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1888656 in OEM Priority Project "[MIR] tlp" [Critical,Triaged]

 14:50 <cpaelzer> I handled this one

 14:50 <cpaelzer> all it needs is a team subscriber

 14:50 <cpaelzer> This is filed by xnox for the OEM team

 14:50 <cpaelzer> so I'm unsure if I need to nudge foundations or Desktop

 14:50 <cpaelzer> but other than the subscription the case is ready

 14:51 <cpaelzer> didrocks: do you happen to know if that would be desktop?

 14:51 <didrocks> IIRC seb128 was not really in favor of it being desktopish

 14:51 <didrocks> as it’s a foundation request

 14:51 <cpaelzer> I don't mind either way, but someone has to step up to own it before promotion

 14:51 <didrocks> agreed

 14:51 <cpaelzer> I made it clear enough on the bug

 14:51 <cpaelzer> so no action here

 14:51 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ipp-usb/+bug/1891157

 14:52 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891157 in golang-github-openprinting-goipp (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ipp-usb" [High,Incomplete]

 14:52 <didrocks> yeah, you already made it clear on the bug

 14:52 <cpaelzer> I did that one as well (the ipp-usb portion)

 14:52 <didrocks> so, on that one, Till was looking at well for a subcriber other than him (on the go binding) :)

 14:52 <cpaelzer> I identified additional dpeendencies and wanted an ack that Desktop (this time the requester) really wants to own all three packages

 14:52 <didrocks> I would say, same, let him sort it out

 14:52 <cpaelzer> yeah we need the team

 14:53 <cpaelzer> as I satetd on the bug

 14:53 <cpaelzer> please get a full Team to subscribe to the package

 14:53 <didrocks> yep

 14:53 <cpaelzer> The printing team (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-printing) is the perfect

 14:53 <cpaelzer> team to actually handle things here and is subscribed already (thanks), but

 14:53 <cpaelzer> you'd (in addition) need a full team to subscribe - ubuntu-desktop in this

 14:53 <cpaelzer> case I guess as fallback for e.g. vacations or any other complex issue you

 14:53 <cpaelzer> can't deal with alone.

 14:53 <cpaelzer> until then  - incomplete

 14:53 <didrocks> sounds perfect to me :)

 14:53 <cpaelzer> and for the chance that it will be dropped I refuse to sit down for many hours reviewing the others and forcing the security Team to do the same

 14:53 <cpaelzer> finally https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libonig/+bug/1889248 I handled two tasks in there

 14:53 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1889248 in mdevctl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] mdevctl, jq, libonig" [Undecided,New]

 14:54 <cpaelzer> one is left open and doko assigned, but he is off for a while

 14:54 <cpaelzer> so it will wait

 14:54 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usbguard/+bug/1816548 also had some activity

 14:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1816548 in usbguard (Ubuntu) "[MIR] usbguard" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:54 <cpaelzer> It seems everyone would like to have it, but no one wants to own it

 14:54 <cpaelzer> I guess I made that clear on the bug - no need to action here

 14:54 <cpaelzer> that is it with the list

 14:55 <didrocks> just read your comment, it’s clear to me

 14:55 <cpaelzer> you see I was reviewing a lot this week :-)

 14:55 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:55 <didrocks> yeah, you were quite busy as I see :)

 14:55 <cpaelzer> We are getting closer to FF and we can see the expected spike of MIRs

 14:55 <cpaelzer> I might slightly complain that ddstreet and sarnold haven't said a word but most likely they are on PTO as well

 14:56 <cpaelzer> I'm out of topics for today

 14:56 <didrocks> those people still connected on IRC during holidays… :)

 14:56 <sarnold> I've said "good morning" :)

 14:56 <cpaelzer> hehe

 14:56 <cpaelzer> and I'm guilty of reading over it without my brain enabled

 14:56 <cpaelzer> hi sarnold o/

 14:56 <cpaelzer> I'm looking forward to insihgt on the golang-* chaos in mismatches next week

 14:56 <sarnold> hey cpaelzer :)

 14:56 <didrocks> hey sarnold, I missed your good morning as well :)

 14:57 <didrocks> yeah

 14:57 <cpaelzer> sarnold: did you get to the review we assigned two weeks ago?

 14:57 <sarnold> cpaelzer: no :( I'm sorry

 14:57 <sarnold> hey didrocks :)

 14:57 <cpaelzer> please feel stared on by whoever requested it to get to it :-)

 14:57 <cpaelzer> but we are not yet on that much delay that we need to panic on it

 14:58 <cpaelzer> sarnold: for the log - do you have a lik which one that was?

 14:58 <cpaelzer> link

 14:58 <didrocks> door ringing brb

 14:58 <didrocks> otherwise, see you next week!

 14:58 <sarnold> cpaelzer: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libinih/+bug/1883890

 14:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1883890 in libinih (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libinih" [Undecided,New]

 14:58 <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold

 14:58 <xnox> cpaelzer:  re:tlp => yeah we were not sure, if it would fit into any existing subscriber teams. Or if we need a new one something like "oem" "desktop-oem" "commercial-engineering" or some such.

 14:59 <xnox> and add it properly into the team reports etc.

 14:59 <cpaelzer> xnox: ok, thanks for the info - so it seems the discussion is ongoing and once resolved someone will own it

 14:59 <cpaelzer> once that happens it can be promoted to main then

 14:59 <xnox> because for example if all of our certified laptops stop using tlp, we'd want to drop it from main, and I don't know if foundations has visibility on that per se.

 14:59 <xnox> cpaelzer:  ack.

 14:59 <cpaelzer> agreed xnox

 15:00 <cpaelzer> so that closes our "misc" section

 15:00 <cpaelzer> end of the meeting coming unless there is anything you want to bring up ...

 15:00 * xnox missreads libinih as libnih, and i'm like "libnih should be dead by now"

 15:00 <sarnold> xnox: heh, I did the same so many times already..

 15:00 <cpaelzer> me as well

 15:00 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks everyone !

 15:00 <cpaelzer> until next week with many reviewed MIR bugs then

 15:00 <xnox> MIR review please rename package due to PTSD

 15:01 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
