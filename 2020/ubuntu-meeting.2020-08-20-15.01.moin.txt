 15:14 <vorlon> ?

 15:15 <bdmurray> That's the one of which I'm thinking

 15:15 <cpaelzer> mclemenceau: hi I made it out of the other calls - if I might interrupt in which section do I want to talk about mine?

 15:16 <mclemenceau> it's coming soon cpaelzer

 15:16 <bdmurray> well let's card this and comment in the existing card about this bug

 15:17 <mclemenceau> ok carded!

 15:18 <bdmurray> bug 1891623

 15:18 <bdmurray> I guess we should take this

 15:19 <Laney> Heather's trying to reproduce

 15:20 <bdmurray> Okay so can we let it wait Laney?

 15:20 <Laney> would be good if d_oko or whoever and Heather could work together

 15:20 <bdmurray> d_oko is out for a while

 15:20 <Laney> ah ok

 15:20 <xnox> Laney:  yeah, ideally we'd want preprocessed source of a "small" binary (if there is any), the binary, and the coredump / traceback?

 15:20 <Laney> I know

 15:20 <Laney> but the first step is reproducing it at all

 15:20 <xnox> and yes d o k o is out for 2 weeks =/

 15:20 <Laney> come back to it next week

 15:20 <bdmurray> Will do thanks

 15:20 <bdmurray> Okay cpaelzer its your turn

 15:21 <cpaelzer> hehe

 15:21 <cpaelzer> thanks

 15:21 <mclemenceau> I tagged this one this morning bug 1892358 not showing on the report yet

 15:21 <ubottu> bug 1892358 in systemd (Ubuntu) "autopkgtest success rate dropped inhibiting proposed migration" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1892358

 15:21 <cpaelzer> I was this morning trying to catch rbalint for systemd autopkgtest fail-rate

 15:21 <cpaelzer> but learned that he's unavailable atm

 15:21 <cpaelzer> thanks mclemenceau for the bug

 15:22 <cpaelzer> I only wnated to ask if someone here could take a look so that we have a second opinion

 15:22 <xnox> cpaelzer:  that looks like a normal / good pass rate

 15:22 <xnox> i mean, it used to be way worse

 15:22 <cpaelzer> xnox: 10/10 last tests failed

 15:22 <cpaelzer> if that is normal I maybe should change expectations :-)

 15:22 <cpaelzer> I just want to avoid retrying on aveagre ~20 times per test per arch

 15:23 <xnox> at one point i spent more than a year with migrating systemd based on a superset of multiple test runs.

 15:23 <xnox> i.e. there tests passed in this run, that test pasted in that run, and that one i will try to fix next time.

 15:23 <xnox> and next time something else regressed.

 15:23 <xnox> i agree with the sentiment.

 15:23 <cpaelzer> yeah, but for now in groovy we have to do something

 15:23 <cpaelzer> "tests-in-lxd" and "systemd-fsckd" droped below an acceptable rate

 15:23 <xnox> however we just landed new upstream release, and it usually does regress a lot.

 15:24 <cpaelzer> I remember xnox last time you worked on itit was fsckd as well and boot-smoke or something like that

 15:24 <xnox> fsckd one is being fixed in bileto already, that was assigned and was worked last week / this week.

 15:24 <cpaelzer> xnox: yes 246 seems to have made it worse

 15:24 <xnox> lxd => is related to snapd & networkd regressions that are being fixed in snapd

 15:24 <xnox> so there are things that are known and worked on too.

 15:24 <cpaelzer> fsckd of the last three days are all bad, does this fix need to land first?

 15:25 <cpaelzer> do you have a bug on the snapd/network bug I could track?

 15:25 <juliank> g

 15:25 * juliank typo

 15:25 <cpaelzer> initially all I asked was "are these knowns and are there bugs I could track" to if you know them let me know the urls

 15:25 <xnox> cpaelzer:  please stand by whilst i try to find those two fixes

 15:26 <bdmurray> cpaelzer: if xnox gives you bugs / something to watch will you be happy?

 15:26 <xnox> cpaelzer:  https://bileto.ubuntu.com/#/ticket/3801 has fixes for fsckd & networkd

 15:27 <xnox> cpaelzer:  see https://objectstorage.prodstack4-5.canonical.com/v1/AUTH_39a8dbb93caf4ec889f8a1b7f69885db/bileto-3801/2020-08-20_11:08:36/groovy_systemd_packaging_changes.diff

 15:27 <xnox> which should improve/fix/resolve the lxd & fsckd tests.

 15:28 <xnox> cpaelzer:  i mean i could tag them "update-excuse" but that will not make them pop up on the test results of reverse deps?

 15:38 <xnox> so it's all three of us?

 15:38 <sil2100> waveform: continue working on it then, thanks o/

 15:38 <vorlon> sil2100: you're off the hook

 15:38 * sil2100 won for the second time today

 15:39 <vorlon> pam is mine because assigned to me for ftbfs, but I'm not messing with the autopkgtests on the current version in -proposed because I'm prepping a new upstream version for Debian

 15:39 <vorlon> dnspython: sil2100: you can have this one

 15:40 <vorlon> gdbm: autopkgtest failure on i386, this one's never been investigated since we made i386 compat-only

 15:40 <vorlon> would anyone like to take a look at this or is it going to default to me like all the i386 stuff? :)

 15:40 <vorlon> oh I uploaded it

 15:40 <vorlon> so it defaults to me anyway ;)

 15:40 <xnox> i was gonna say.....

 15:41 <sil2100> vorlon: okay!

 15:41 <vorlon> ok gdbm is mine

 15:41 <vorlon> sensible-utils: bdmurray?

 15:41 <xnox> on slyon? the sync was his request to fix ftbfs

 15:41 <vorlon> plymouth vs systemd, rbalint already has a fixed staged for that AIUI

 15:41 <bdmurray> inconceivable!

 15:41 <vorlon> xnox: which one?

 15:41 <xnox> autodep8 was mine, but i am failing to comprehend why ti's failing.

 15:41 <xnox> vorlon:  slon => sensible-utils

 15:42 <vorlon> ok, sensible-utils to slyon, not bdmurray

 15:42 <vorlon> xnox: do you want to keep it or hand it off?

 15:42 <xnox> so i want to give up autodep8 to someone else please

 15:42 <vorlon> autodep8: bdmurray?

 15:42 <bdmurray> okay

 15:42 <vorlon> libgitlab-api-v4-perl: tdaitx?

 15:43 <tdaitx> ok

 15:43 <juliank> (that's a merge of bash-completion FWIW)

 15:43 <vorlon> lintian: juliank?

 15:43 <juliank> (libgitlab-api-v4-perl)

 15:43 <juliank> yeah

 15:43 <juliank> I need to talk to lintian folks about that anyway

 15:43 <vorlon> dput: xnox?

 15:43 <juliank> it also fails in normal lxd containers

 15:43 <xnox> ok

 15:43 <vorlon> actually

 15:44 <vorlon> that's really setuptools

 15:44 <vorlon> xnox: you ok to take setuptools?

 15:44 <xnox> i thought +1 was bootstrapping lintian to be fair

 15:44 <xnox> vorlon:  sure

 15:44 <vorlon> sqlite3

 15:44 <juliank> dput is .. just a timeout

 15:44 <Laney> I am bootstrapping lintian, I am not dealing with the autopkgtest failure or the component-mismatch atm

 15:44 <xnox> ah, ok, thanks.

 15:44 <juliank> (in some cleanup hook)

 15:45 <vorlon> juliank: ok if lintian is no work for you because Laney, can you take sqlite3?

 15:45 <Laney> noooo, please keep the autopkgtest at least :p

 15:45 <vorlon> oh :)

 15:45 <vorlon> then who wants sqlite3?

 15:45 <vorlon> I think everyone's been assigned one

 15:45 <vorlon> so who's hungry for seconds

 15:45 <juliank> So lintian is fine, but sqlite3 is that a gcc-10 bug?

 15:45 <Laney> (the MIR you can reply to my question in #-release to determine if there's work required)

 15:45 <juliank> /tmp/autopkgtest.4tqIue/build.vxn/src/debian/tests/run-unit-tests: line 29:  1275 Illegal instruction     (core dumped) hyphy "$i"

 15:46 <xnox> hyphy is a pile of code that is fragile, it could be hyphy buggy too

 15:47 <juliank> move on?

 15:47 <vorlon> and that's the list

 15:47 <vorlon> bdmurray:

 15:48 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:48 <juliank> I'm mornings-mostly next week

 15:48 <juliank> And DebConfing

 15:48 <juliank> I don't how distracting DebConf online will be

 15:48 <xnox> and LinuxPlumbers

 15:48 <bdmurray> So bug 1798369 I've heard some comments that we should get rid of this and I'd like some reasons

 15:48 <ubottu> bug 1798369 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Reinstall Ubuntu (with preserving existing data) shows error message due to "Could not get lock /target/var/cache/apt/archives/lock"" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1798369

 15:49 <juliank> There are bugs every release cycle about it and nobody really gives it much testing

 15:50 <bdmurray> which it though? The restore packages option or the whole reinstall option?

 15:51 <juliank> restore packages

 15:51 <juliank> I want to keep $HOME, but not try to reinstall packages that were installed

 15:51 <xnox> so, restoring packages indeed doesn't quite make sense

 15:52 <juliank> maybe save an apt-clone tarball in /var/log

 15:52 <xnox> restoring snaps might, but i don't know if we preserve /var/lib/snapd

 15:52 <bdmurray> hey let's not make new features!

 15:53 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll discuss with the desktop team about removing the restore packages option.

 15:54 <bdmurray> anything else?

 15:54 <bdmurray> okay, thanks everybody

 15:54 <bdmurray> #endmeeting
