 14:30 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:30 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Aug 11 14:30:50 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:30 <meetingology> 

 14:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:30 <cpaelzer> hi jamespage: ddstreet: sarnold:

 14:31 <cpaelzer> we are a reduced team again with doko and didrocks being out this week

 14:31 <cpaelzer> gladly I could convince seb128 to attend in case we need AA actions (and my precheck indicates we will)

 14:31 <cpaelzer> welcome him

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:32 <cpaelzer> we had one action to check if probert-network still doesn't show up in component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> it does still seem wrong (is in universe, but is depended from main, not showing)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I have asked Odd_Bloke to file a bug and get in touch wit hthe archive admins about that oddity

 14:33 <seb128> :-)

 14:33 <cpaelzer> seems nothing we could do a lot about

 14:33 <sarnold> good morning

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> we have a bunch ready to promote today

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and a puzzle :-)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> let us go one by one

 14:34 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-requests-toolbelt/+bug/1751093

 14:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1751093 in python-requests-toolbelt (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-requests-toolbelt" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:34 <cpaelzer> that is ready (from past review)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> and now depended on again

 14:34 <cpaelzer> openstack is still subscribed

 14:34 <cpaelzer> so I gues we'd just want that to be re-promoted in groovy

 14:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: any objections to do that?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> arr

 14:35 <cpaelzer> just found out jamespage is out this week as well

 14:36 <cpaelzer> but the case is rather clear

 14:36 <cpaelzer> anyone else to object re-promoting that=

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ?

 14:36 <sarnold> wfm

 14:36 <cpaelzer> seb128:  would you take this to promote it to groovy-main?

 14:36 <seb128> sure

 14:36 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:37 <cpaelzer> next case is actually a double

 14:37 <cpaelzer> hwloc depends on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/s390-dasd/+bug/1522003

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1522003 in s390-dasd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] s390-dasd" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:37 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/s390-sysconfig-writer/+bug/1522002

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1522002 in s390-sysconfig-writer (Ubuntu) "[MIR] s390-sysconfig-writer" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:37 <cpaelzer> both were in main before

 14:37 <cpaelzer> they are ready to be promoted

 14:37 <cpaelzer> TBH I don't see why they even demoted in the first place

 14:37 <cpaelzer> IMHO those should also be (re-)promoted

 14:37 <cpaelzer> any objection to that?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I take that as a now and the case is rather clear again

 14:39 <sarnold> wfm

 14:39 <cpaelzer> seb128: those would be the next to for you - ok with that ?

 14:39 <seb128> k

 14:39 <cpaelzer> last item out of this category is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/khronos-opencl-clhpp/+bug/1636728

 14:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1636728 in khronos-opencl-clhpp (Ubuntu) "[MIR] khronos-opencl-clhpp" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:39 <cpaelzer> here we need the desktop Team anyway - the package was in main , the MIR is ready - but the subscriber was unclear

 14:39 <cpaelzer> "ubuntu-x" is subscribed

 14:40 <cpaelzer> we were wondering if that is still an active team from canonicals POV (to provide support in main)

 14:40 <cpaelzer> seb128: do you happen to know since "ubuntu-x" sounds so Desktop'ish?

 14:40 <cpaelzer> this one https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat

 14:41 <seb128> I don't think it's in the official list no

 14:41 <cpaelzer> seb128: thanks

 14:41 <cpaelzer> seb128: cuold you carry https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/khronos-opencl-clhpp/+bug/1636728 to the Desktop Team meeting then to sort out who should subsceribe now?

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1636728 in khronos-opencl-clhpp (Ubuntu) "[MIR] khronos-opencl-clhpp" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:41 <cpaelzer> "subscribe"

 14:42 <seb128> ack

 14:42 <cpaelzer> the next in component mismatches is a massive tree of golang things

 14:42 <cpaelzer> but not listing the root of the dependency

 14:43 <cpaelzer> further to the right there is "gcc-compute-image-packages" which sounds suspicious to be related

 14:43 <cpaelzer> does anyone know or has worked on that?

 14:43 <seb128> the khronos package seems to be pulled in by ocl-icd which is owned by kernel so I would suggest kernel should look at that one

 14:43 <cpaelzer> since doko isn't here let me ping xnox - as maybe is is around and knows about it ^^

 14:44 <cpaelzer> seb128: agreed (we said and have seen the same last week) - but since the old owner was ubuntu-x it would be Dekstop to punt it over to kernel

 14:44 <cpaelzer> maybe just get your and their manager connected

 14:44 <cpaelzer> or do you prefer me to do the mailing

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I can do it if you like

 14:44 <seb128> k

 14:45 <seb128> I can handle it

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks

 14:45 <seb128> np!

 14:45 <xnox> cpaelzer:  sorry, what are you asking me?

 14:45 <cpaelzer> xnox: hi

 14:45 <cpaelzer> xnox do you know about all the google/golang things in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg ?

 14:45 <cpaelzer> we were wondering if that is any foundation driven effort?

 14:46 <xnox> cpaelzer:  i think it's on rbalint to file all the MIRs and subscribe either foundations or cpc/cloudware.

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I beg your pardon - since doko isn't here to speak for foundations I asked you

 14:46 <cpaelzer> thank you - that makes sense then

 14:46 <cpaelzer> all other things in there are known cases and actively handled one or the other way

 14:47 <cpaelzer> I'll take an action to sort with vorlon how to handle the subscription problem that doko brought up for the fonts package

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #action - cpaelzer to ask Steve how to fastpath font packages without subscriptions

 14:47 * meetingology - cpaelzer to ask Steve how to fastpath font packages without subscriptions

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:47 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> up until a few minutes ago there was https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-jwcrypto/+bug/1869215

 14:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1869215 in python-jwcrypto (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-jwcrypto" [High,In progress]

 14:48 <cpaelzer> but that will work out once jamespage is back

 14:48 <cpaelzer> really new is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ipp-usb/+bug/1891157

 14:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1891157 in ipp-usb (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ipp-usb" [High,New]

 14:48 <cpaelzer> and that looks for a reviewer

 14:48 <cpaelzer> I have to admit I didn't even get to process my assignments of last week :-/

 14:48 <cpaelzer> does anyone have the breathing room to look at this (two packages actually)

 14:48 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ddstreet: ^^ ?

 14:49 <ddstreet> i haven't got to the one i took last week either

 14:49 <sarnold> I've still not finished the previous pcakage I've accepted :( I should say no on this one

 14:49 <cpaelzer> ok so we are all in the sma eboat

 14:49 <cpaelzer> same boat

 14:49 <cpaelzer> we will let it open for this week

 14:50 <cpaelzer> butnext week we need to asign someone as the target is 20.10

 14:50 <cpaelzer> maybe I can take a few hours off my +1 duty without being slapped too hard

 14:50 <cpaelzer> we will see

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:50 <cpaelzer> nothing new here

 14:51 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:51 <cpaelzer> ok, that is it then

 14:51 <cpaelzer> thanks everyone that isn't on PTO :-)

 14:51 <cpaelzer> we see the expected end-of-cycle ramp up of activity here

 14:51 <cpaelzer> see you all next week

 14:52 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
