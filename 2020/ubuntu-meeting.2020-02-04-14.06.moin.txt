 14:06 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:06 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Feb  4 14:06:35 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:06 <meetingology> 

 14:06 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:06 <cpaelzer> skipping previous-action items as we had no explicit ones

 14:07 <cpaelzer> let me know if I have just missed them :-)

 14:07 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:07 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:07 <cpaelzer> has two entries

 14:07 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jeepney/+bug/1861268

 14:07 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1861268 in jeepney (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jeepney" [Undecided,New]

 14:08 <cpaelzer> has anyone history/experience with that to be a fast review?

 14:08 <cpaelzer> a.k.a call for volunteers

 14:08 <cpaelzer> python-dbus interface smells like a case for pythonic people - doko/jamespage maybe?

 14:09 <didrocks> doesn‚Äôt sound straightforward either and security sensitive no?

 14:10 <cpaelzer> I'd expect anything *dbus* to be security sensitive

 14:10 <jamespage> agreed

 14:11 <doko> ok

 14:11 <cpaelzer> and who wants to do the packaging check to then pass it on to security?

 14:12 <cpaelzer> It seems we fast-path agreed on the result, but somone has to do the formal check (maybe there is more that needs to be fixed)

 14:12 <joeubuntu> will jeepney be required for Focal?

 14:13 <joeubuntu> really just anything we talk about today , if we need it for 20.04 just let me know.

 14:14 <cpaelzer> it is in component-mismatches already

 14:14 <cpaelzer> https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.html

 14:14 <cpaelzer> depended on by python3-secretstorage

 14:15 <cpaelzer> does any of the following rev-deps ring a bell why this is in main

 14:15 <cpaelzer> $ reverse-depends -r focal python3-secretstorage

 14:15 <cpaelzer> Reverse-Recommends

 14:15 <cpaelzer> ==================

 14:15 <cpaelzer> * backintime-qt

 14:15 <cpaelzer> * nagstamon

 14:15 <cpaelzer> Reverse-Depends

 14:15 <cpaelzer> ===============

 14:15 <cpaelzer> * python3-datalad

 14:15 <cpaelzer> * python3-keyring

 14:15 <cpaelzer> * unity-mail

 14:16 <didrocks> (sorry, I meant seems security sensitive or not straightforward, but double negative :p)

 14:16 <cpaelzer> ok it comes from python3-keyring

 14:17 <cpaelzer> which then on revdeps hits openstack with python3-keystoneclient python3-novaclient and others

 14:17 <cpaelzer> jamespage: would you mind doing the https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jeepney/+bug/1861268 review

 14:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1861268 in jeepney (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jeepney" [Undecided,New]

 14:17 <cpaelzer> it seems eventually it is you needing it anyway ?

 14:18 <cpaelzer> and once you have assessed the case you could let joeubuntu know if this is urgent-20.04 material

 14:18 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yeah I can do that

 14:18 <joeubuntu> üëç

 14:18 <cpaelzer> great

 14:18 <cpaelzer> the next in the list was ec2-instance connetc

 14:18 <cpaelzer> I have reviewed that in the past

 14:18 <cpaelzer> and denied

 14:19 <cpaelzer> the old missing bits are not provided, it was expired and accidentially set back to new

 14:19 <cpaelzer> I clarified on the bug and set it back to incomplete

 14:19 <cpaelzer> done with new MIR bugs

 14:19 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:19 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:20 <cpaelzer> of these I just mentioned ec2-instance-connect

 14:20 <cpaelzer> that is ok

 14:20 <cpaelzer> further we have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyrsistent/+bug/1860422

 14:20 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1860422 in pyrsistent (Ubuntu) "[MIR] pyrsistent, required by python-jsconschema" [High,Incomplete]

 14:20 <cpaelzer> have you talked about this last week?

 14:20 <cpaelzer> doko: jamespage: this one seems between you two

 14:21 <doko> yep, I filed the incomplete one

 14:21 <jamespage> needs someone in u-openstack to fill in the details - I'll poke sahid and coreycb

 14:21 <cpaelzer> ok, so this one will make progress as well then

 14:21 <cpaelzer> all others are old and were handled int he past

 14:21 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:21 <cpaelzer> anything else by any of you?

 14:21 <cpaelzer> didrocks: jamespage: joeubuntu: doko ?

 14:21 <jamespage> o/

 14:21 <jamespage> yes

 14:21 <jamespage> one sec

 14:22 <joeubuntu> nothing for me

 14:22 <didrocks> (nothing particular for me)

 14:22 <doko> not from my side

 14:22 <cpaelzer> nothing (new) for server-team

 14:22 <jamespage> had I not had a launchpad timeout this AM

 14:22 <jamespage> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/masakari/+bug/1815991

 14:22 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1815991 in masakari-monitors (Ubuntu) "[MIR] masakari and masakari-monitors" [Undecided,New]

 14:22 <jamespage> would have been marked back as New rather than Incomplete

 14:23 <jamespage> I was reviewing MIR work for 20.04 deliverables and realised we had put that one on hold but now needs revisiting

 14:23 <doko> didrocks: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/1:6.4.0-0ubuntu2  this is an ugly thing, using the interncal copy ...

 14:23 <cpaelzer> jamespage: so you are looking for a reviewer on 1815991 now is that correct?

 14:24 <jamespage> yes please

 14:24 <cpaelzer> I can take a look tomorrow

 14:24 <didrocks> doko: can you mention it to marcustomlinson on #u-desktop or should I?

 14:24 <cpaelzer> jamespage: is this 20.04 material

 14:24 <didrocks> or even here, he‚Äôs around, do done :)

 14:24 <didrocks> so*

 14:24 <jamespage> yep

 14:24 <doko> didrocks: please do

 14:24 <cpaelzer> jamespage: joeubuntu left already, you might want to let him know per email then?

 14:25 <marcustomlinson> doko: no, I simply removed the dep, no internal copy used

 14:25 <jamespage> yep will raise it although I would think it won't require security review

 14:25 <doko> ahh, ok

 14:25 <didrocks> +# SYSTEM_STUFF += qrcodegen

 14:25 <jamespage> being yet-another openstack python daemon thingmy

 14:25 <didrocks> yeah :)

 14:25 <cpaelzer> jamespage: I'll need soem time to look at it and agree that no security is needed

 14:25 <cpaelzer> but I'm glad to know your expectation ...

 14:25 <cpaelzer> I have one more for desktop didrocks

 14:25 <cpaelzer> in the incomplete MIRs we have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061

 14:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 711061 in openjpeg2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] openjpeg2" [High,Incomplete]

 14:26 <cpaelzer> didrocks: this still needs a team subscriber

 14:26 <cpaelzer> and a security review

 14:26 <didrocks> cpaelzer: handling it

 14:26 <cpaelzer> didrocks: you might want to fixup both so it can go forward

 14:26 <didrocks> well, not the security part :p

 14:26 <didrocks> yep

 14:26 <cpaelzer> didrocks: but you can set the assigned team to ubuntu-security

 14:26 <cpaelzer> ok, it seems we are good for now

 14:26 <didrocks> doing

 14:26 <cpaelzer> jamespage: I'll let you know if I find anything discussion worthy

 14:27 <cpaelzer> in masakari

 14:27 <jamespage> thankyee

 14:27 <cpaelzer> I'll close the meeting if nothing else comes up in

 14:27 <cpaelzer> 10

 14:27 <cpaelzer> 5

 14:27 <cpaelzer> 2

 14:27 <cpaelzer> 1
