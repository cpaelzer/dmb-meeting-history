 19:19 * icey waves

 19:20 <rbasak> I'm going to break from tradition and not bother to ask icey to introduce his application since that's all clearly laid out on his wiki page

 19:20 <rbasak> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChrisMacNaughton/OpenStackDeveloperApplication

 19:20 <rbasak> Welcome icey :)

 19:20 <rbasak> Does anyone have any questions for icey?

 19:20 <icey> thanks rbasak!

 19:20 <rafaeldtinoco> need a mom

 19:20 <rafaeldtinoco> (ent) ?

 19:20 <rafaeldtinoco> =)

 19:21 <rbasak> icey: which previous meeting did you attend that failed to get quorum, OOI? I only see one devel-permissions@ post scheduling your application for just this meeting?

 19:22 <icey> I didn't attend the previous one, but I did read some of the meeting logs

 19:22 <rbasak> Ah OK

 19:22 <icey> I iwas just being sad that there was seeming trouble getting to quorum previously as well

 19:22 <icey> s/iwas/was

 19:22 <rbasak> Got it, thanks.

 19:22 <rbasak> Sorry I misunderstood you earlier.

 19:23 <rbasak> I have a question to get us started.

 19:24 <rbasak> What's the current situation with OpenStack's release schedule and its alignment with Ubuntu, and where would I find more information about that?

 19:25 <icey> For both the current and next releases, they are scheduled for just before the corresponding OpenStack releases. Victoria is scheduled for next week, and Wallaby is scheduled fairly close to the Ubuntu H release

 19:26 <rbasak> Sorry, I phrased that poorly. Let me try again. I mean with respect to Ubuntu's release schedule specifically, in terms of freeze and freeze exceptions.

 19:26 <icey> I'm apparently having trouble loading the pages but those are generally published at https://releases.openstack.org/victoria/schedule.html and https://releases.openstack.org/wallaby/schedule.html

 19:27 <icey> Ok - The OpenStack releases generally are fairly close to an Ubuntu release by release date, and generally have a freeze exception to cover the release

 19:27 <rbasak> In other words what changes can you upload Openstack package updates in the development release of Ubuntu and when?

 19:28 <rbasak> Do you know how this is coordinated in Ubuntu with respect to the release schedule, the freeze timeline and the release team?

 19:29 <icey> As I currently understand it, the OpenStack packages get updates to the development release untili the final OpenStack release. Last release (Focal + OpenStack Ussuri), OpenStack shipped the final release after the release which required a lot of coordination and discussion with the release team to ship the final release

 19:30 <icey> In terms of coordination, Corey generally starts a conversation with release timings to the release team via mailing list

 19:30 <ddstreet> as an example, let's say you wanted to have a new feature included in qemu in victora; how would you do that, if possible (assuming you start work on it today)?

 19:30 <icey> Broadly, I wouldn't.

 19:32 <icey> If there were something compelling enough to not do the general thing, I would try to start a discussion about the feasibility of a freeze exception in #ubuntu-release as well as on the mailing list

 19:32 <ddstreet> ok thanks

 19:33 <slashd> o/

 19:33 <ddstreet> hello, we have quorum! o/

 19:33 <icey> \o/

 19:33 <rafaeldtinoco> icey: and after uploading to devel, where would you check DEP8 issues if any ?

 19:34 <rafaeldtinoco> how would you know issue is intermittent ?

 19:34 * slashd catching up on the discusion (give me a moment to read)

 19:35 <icey> Whenever I get a notification about a build failure (or an autopkgtest failure), my first step is to attemp to reproduce it locally. If I cannot reproduce it locally, then I'd re-run the failing build / test

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> icey: do you know where to check if your failure is holding other packages migrations ?

 19:37 <icey> I would generally go look in https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/groovy/update_excuses.html (recently)

 19:37 <rafaeldtinoco> cool, tku

 19:39 <rafaeldtinoco> slashd: do you have any questions for icey ?

 19:39 <ddstreet> icey as an administrative question, just to be sure, you're applying for upload rights to the 'openstack' packageset, correct? https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/packagesets/groovy/openstack

 19:40 <ddstreet> i only ask to clarify, as it currently has no team, so we would need to create a team to add you to

 19:40 <icey> ddstreet: If that's the best option? I've been working with coreycb and jamespage on OpenStack packaging, but has generally included a lot larger set than just those packages

 19:40 <slashd> rafaeldtinoco: I'm good with the questionned already asked, I have nothing to add for now

 19:41 <ddstreet> icey yeah, i wonder if the 'openstack' packageset needs to be expanded

 19:42 <icey> ddstreet: I wonder if there's a better packageset to represent ubuntu-openstack (as referenced from a recent test rebuild: https://people.canonical.com/~doko/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20200728-groovy-groovy.html#ubuntu-openstack)

 19:42 <rbasak> Any more questions for icey?

 19:42 <rbasak> icey: that's the team package subscriber list I think, which is distinctly different from the packageset

 19:42 <rbasak> It's managed by the team, so I don't think it would be appropriate to drive ACLs from it.

 19:43 <icey> rbasak: indeed

 19:43 <rbasak> We need a DMB-managed list and that's the packageset.

 19:43 <rafaeldtinoco> (or seed changes ?)

 19:43 <rbasak> I don't think this packageset is automatic is it?

 19:44 <rbasak> We can carry on discussing the technicalities, but if there are no more questions, shall we move on to a vote?

 19:44 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: yes

 19:44 <ddstreet> no more q from me

 19:44 <ddstreet> slashd ready for vote?

 19:49 <ddstreet> congrats icey!

 19:49 <icey> thanks!

 19:49 <icey> and I'm excited to help with getting the seed / packageset updated :)

 19:50 <rbasak> Any volunteers to announce icey's successful application and to get the ACL changes made?

 19:50 <slashd> Congrats icey ;)

 19:50 <rafaeldtinoco> congrats!

 19:50 <rbasak> Is there any clarification on the ACL changes required in this case?

 19:50 <icey> thanks again :)

 19:50 <ddstreet> i can handle the acl and announcement

 19:50 <Bashing-om> ddstreet: For UWN: Do not ovelook to promulgamate the new addition to the mailing list :D

 19:50 <rbasak> Looks like we'll need to create a team, ask the TB to add that to the ACL, etc.

 19:50 <rbasak> Thanks ddstreet!

 19:51 <ddstreet> yep, i'll create the team and add him, then open a TB request

 19:51 <icey> I think (and Corey agrees) that the OpenStack packageset could definitely use some updating, and I'm happy to help with getting that done

 19:51 <rbasak> #action ddstreet to announce icey's successful application

 19:51 * meetingology ddstreet to announce icey's successful application
