 14:30 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Sep  8 14:30:26 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:30 <meetingology> 

 14:30 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:30 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: sarnold: didrocks: jamespage: doko: - Hi o/

 14:30 <sarnold> good morning

 14:31 <ddstreet> o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> doko: I'm not sure if you are fully back, let us know when you are around :-)

 14:31 <didrocks> hey o/

 14:31 <cpaelzer> hello, let us get started here ...

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:31 <cpaelzer> that one is easy, no previous items other than doing reviews of last week

 14:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:32 <cpaelzer> you'll see openstack showing up on "its own" now which is a change I did and jamespage agreed

 14:32 <cpaelzer> that isn't changing mismatches, just that we more clearly see where things come from

 14:32 <cpaelzer> jamespage: there is a whole bunch of octavia things that need some handling once you can get to it

 14:33 <cpaelzer> I thinke coreycb filed them, jamespage reviewed and they are not in the security queue

 14:33 <cpaelzer> other things in mismatches

 14:34 <cpaelzer> shim-canonical was mentioned in a discussion by xnox recently, that belongs to the boot process and should be rather new (didn

 14:34 <cpaelzer> 't exist last time)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> iüü-usb is ready but for the security review as well

 14:34 <cpaelzer> nice

 14:34 <cpaelzer> ipp-usb I meant

 14:34 <sarnold> :)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> the lintian->*perl is usually handled by doko/foundations

 14:35 * cpaelzer hopes he is back now or at least next week to do that

 14:35 <cpaelzer> didrocks: you wanted to check gnome-software last week

 14:35 <cpaelzer> found anything?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> it is still in mismatches

 14:35 <didrocks> cpaelzer: I investigated, one sec, need to find my notes :)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> :-)

 14:36 <cpaelzer> they didn't end up as comment on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-software/+bug/1536870

 14:36 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1536870 in gnome-software (Ubuntu) "[MIR] gnome-software" [Undecided,Fix released]

 14:37 <didrocks> the issue is that gstreamer1.0-packagekit Recommends 'gnome-software | apper | packagekit-installer'

 14:37 <didrocks> packagekit-installer is provided by ubuntu-desktop

 14:37 <cpaelzer> and you want that recommends reduced then?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> instead of a re-promotion

 14:37 <didrocks> he issue is that the feature is provided by snap-store but we don't have a way to tell apt or germinate about that snap

 14:37 <didrocks> t*

 14:37 <didrocks> so, we don’t want to introduce a delta, we are in sync with debian

 14:37 <didrocks> we don’t want it in main

 14:38 <didrocks> seb asked foundation for a blacklist of our tooling

 14:38 <didrocks> no answer AFAIK

 14:38 <didrocks> I will ask again

 14:38 <didrocks> or snap store providing those requirements :)

 14:38 <cpaelzer> didrocks: the platform .git has the blacklist

 14:38 <cpaelzer> just propose a MP against it right away

 14:39 <cpaelzer> https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/platform

 14:39 <didrocks> I will have a try there

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:39 <cpaelzer> logcheck - hmm

 14:40 <cpaelzer> server team needs to look after that one

 14:40 <cpaelzer> I'll pass that on

 14:41 <cpaelzer> nothing else surprisingly new there

 14:41 <cpaelzer> going on

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:41 <cpaelzer> didrocks: libostree was yours and got back to new

 14:42 <cpaelzer> is that on your todo list already?

 14:42 <didrocks> cpaelzer: yep

 14:42 <cpaelzer> ok

 14:42 <cpaelzer> and then due to your review on google-guest-agent telling them they need all golang deps

 14:42 <cpaelzer> we now have a bunch of gloang deps opened

 14:43 <didrocks> I can take some, but not all

 14:43 <sarnold> - Upstream makes no releases, Debian is behind by many upstream commits

 14:43 <cpaelzer> sarnold: is that for these glang things?

 14:43 <sarnold> ouch :(

 14:43 <didrocks> (I know quite well upstream code for protobuf and ini-ini)

 14:43 <sarnold> cpaelzer: yeah

 14:44 <cpaelzer> then didrocks why don't you take proto and ininit

 14:44 <cpaelzer> that is two

 14:44 <cpaelzer> I'd take kardianos (two)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> leaves tarm groupcache and logging

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: sarnold: jamespage: one each ?

 14:45 <sarnold> cpaelzer: better not, I've got a large security backlog to work through, sorry :(

 14:45 <cpaelzer> let us not talk about backlogs, but I understand

 14:45 <ddstreet> i can take 2

 14:46 <cpaelzer> logging is incomplete

 14:46 <cpaelzer> so take the other two

 14:46 <ddstreet> ack

 14:46 <cpaelzer> I assigned you

 14:46 <cpaelzer> ok, enough work from new :-/

 14:46 <cpaelzer> let us look at incomplete

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:46 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:47 <cpaelzer> well the same topic on google-* go things

 14:47 <cpaelzer> ipmitool is driven by server & foundations but not ready yet

 14:47 <cpaelzer> nftables waits on some more info

 14:47 <cpaelzer> yeah nothing in there requires work by us atm

 14:48 <cpaelzer> other opinions looking through thos?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> e

 14:48 <cpaelzer> we can still speak up in the next section

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:49 <cpaelzer> as I mentioned we landed several seed changes (what made openstack visible in mismatches)

 14:49 <cpaelzer> but we changed way more, I'm glad it didn't totally break everything

 14:49 <cpaelzer> :-)

 14:49 <sarnold> hehe, nice

 14:49 <cpaelzer> anything else for today?

 14:49 <didrocks> nothing for me

 14:50 <cpaelzer> well then take the 10 minutes we gained for something useful

 14:50 <cpaelzer> see you next week with all assigned MIRs reviewed :-)

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
