 14:32 <meetingology> 

 14:32 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:32 <didrocks> hey

 14:32 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:32 <cpaelzer> we have set up the new meeting time and added the fast path option to the wiki

 14:32 <cpaelzer> no new actions to check

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:33 <cpaelzer> there are a few new ones to quickly mention in there today :-/

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:33 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:33 <didrocks> appstream is handled on our side, could be just moving -doc to universe, so not a proper MIR needed

 14:33 <cpaelzer> nice

 14:34 <cpaelzer> doko: last week said the perl'y things are on them and they are gone

 14:34 <cpaelzer> thanks foundations

 14:34 <doko> done

 14:34 <cpaelzer> worth to mention is some openstack stuff jamespage

 14:34 <cpaelzer> masakari and deps as well as heat and deps

 14:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: do you have any details on those?

 14:35 <cpaelzer> and while we wait on that answer, does anyone feel responsible for paramiko->python-invoke ?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> well, jamespage seems to be unavailable today

 14:37 <cpaelzer> these packages won't move without some effort

 14:37 <jamespage> cpaelzer: sorry - multi-tasking

 14:37 <cpaelzer> but we don't have to sit and wait here

 14:37 <jamespage> but really multi-failing

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ah o/

 14:37 <cpaelzer> oO

 14:37 <jamespage> but here now

 14:37 <cpaelzer> jamespage: masakari and heat

 14:38 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yep new deps

 14:38 <cpaelzer> jamespage: what is the plan of action

 14:38 <jamespage> great

 14:38 <cpaelzer> will you file MIRs or modify the packages?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I'd think whatever it is we can leave that to you right?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> and I just relaized that "paramiko" is part of the same

 14:38 <jamespage> I'll get icey to look into that again

 14:38 <cpaelzer> python3-tempest -> paramiko -> pytohn-invoke

 14:38 <jamespage> I though we had dropped sqla-utils from masakari

 14:39 <cpaelzer> jamespage: would you add paramiko to the list to look at as well?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> jamespage: I agree, dropping it is what I remember

 14:39 <cpaelzer> can we leave that to you and next week these are either proprt MIRs or the mismatch is gone ?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> s/proprt/proper/

 14:41 <cpaelzer> jamespage: is multitasking again I guess

 14:41 <cpaelzer> let us consider this on him (and the openstack team) unless he tells us otherwise in next weeks meeting

 14:41 <cpaelzer> going on with the meeting

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:41 <cpaelzer> we have one new

 14:41 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:41 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mathjax/+bug/1878937

 14:41 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1878937 in mathjax (Ubuntu) "[MIR] mathjax" [Undecided,New]

 14:42 <jamespage> cpaelzer: yes

 14:42 <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage

 14:42 <cpaelzer> mathjax seems related to sphinx-doc

 14:42 <cpaelzer> anyone having a spre cycle to MIR-evaluate that one?

 14:43 <didrocks> I can have a look

 14:43 <cpaelzer> thank you so much didrocks

 14:43 <cpaelzer> assigned

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:43 <cpaelzer> I have checked, nothing new in here

 14:43 <cpaelzer> the last update is by me

 14:43 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:44 * cpaelzer is glad to have sarnold around now

 14:44 <doko> nothing from my side

 14:44 <cpaelzer> he didn't say a lot, but the times will come again when we have complex security questions

 14:44 <sarnold> thanks everyone for sticking around later :D

 14:44 <didrocks> great to see you around sarnold :)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> ok that will be it for this week then

 14:45 <cpaelzer> thanks everyone

 14:45 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
