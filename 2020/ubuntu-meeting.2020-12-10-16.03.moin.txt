 16:11 <waveform> * Testing experimental tryboot firmware on all supported models and archs (all successful so far, just Compute Modules to go)

 16:11 <waveform> * Onboarding and Core 20 boot meetings

 16:17 <doko> I'm inclined to give up on that. this doesn't look like a compiler problem, but a kvm problem

 16:18 <mclemenceau> ok, I would tend to agree on this.

 16:18 <mclemenceau> next bug 1902671

 16:18 <ubottu> bug 1902671 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "First time setup on raspberry Pi" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1902671

 16:18 <mclemenceau> I don't think we got more details on this one

 16:18 <mclemenceau> since last week

 16:19 <sil2100> Yeah, no action for now

 16:19 <xnox> changed to notfixing

 16:19 <xnox> next

 16:22 <mclemenceau> doko says it is fixed, so let's move to next one

 16:22 <mclemenceau> bug 1906078

 16:22 <ubottu> bug 1906078 in whoopsie (Ubuntu) "Whoopsie sends bug reports automatically without consent" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1906078

 16:23 <mclemenceau> Ok this one is alreaady carded and bdmurray has been working on it

 16:23 <mclemenceau> will remove the hh tag

 16:23 <mclemenceau> #topic Release incoming bugs (focal)

 16:23 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:26 <mclemenceau> definitely should be carded, seems that it should be looked at

 16:26 <sil2100> Yes, thanks!

 16:27 <mclemenceau> ok carded. next

 16:27 <mclemenceau> bug 1898026

 16:27 <ubottu> bug 1898026 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "interruption of dist-upgrade can leave you next release in sources.list" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1898026

 16:27 <mclemenceau> I had a talk with bdmurray yesterday about that one

 16:32 <mclemenceau> We won't card it just yet

 16:32 <mclemenceau> let's go see bionic

 16:32 <mclemenceau> #topic Release incoming bugs (bionic)

 16:32 <mclemenceau> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-bb-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs

 16:33 <mclemenceau> quite a few, but the latest is from 11/23

 16:33 <mclemenceau> bug 1905245

 16:33 <ubottu> bug 1905245 in systemd (Ubuntu Focal) ""Failed to parse bus message: Invalid argument" with Linux 5.8" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1905245

 16:33 <mclemenceau> I believe this one is under control and alreaady carded anyway

 16:35 <rbalint> i'm already working on the glibc one

 16:36 <xnox> or like it would be nice to sort by when tag was added (but that needs parsing the activity of each bug)

 16:36 <rbalint> +1

 16:36 <mclemenceau> Ok, let's move on, we'll go through the bionic queue later

 16:36 <mclemenceau> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 16:36 <mclemenceau> vorlon, you're on!

 16:37 <mclemenceau> #link http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:37 <vorlon> [LINK] https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 16:37 <vorlon> looking much healthier this week now that python3/perl/re2 have migrated

 16:37 <mclemenceau> wow 13! looking nice indeed

 16:37 <vorlon> fakeroot: bdmurray had this last week, will leave this with thim

 16:38 <vorlon> libmoo-perl vs libmongodb-perl

 16:39 <vorlon> anyone in particular want this?

 16:39 <slyon> vorlon: I can have a look

 16:39 <vorlon> slyon: thanks

 16:39 <vorlon> lintian... still blocked by MIR

 16:40 <vorlon> devscripts, autopkgtest regressions

 16:40 <vorlon> rbalint: would you like to take devscripts?

 16:40 <rbalint> sure

 16:42 <vorlon> ubuntu-meta: there's a component mismatch; I have no problem with moving these packages to restricted but there should be some resolution of the fact that this change to ubuntu-meta source means any of the metapackages could end up with a restricted dependency without feedback

 16:42 <vorlon> I'll take ubuntu-meta to follow up on the component mismatch at least

 16:42 <sil2100> vorlon: o/

 16:42 <vorlon> adduser, various autopkgtest regressions evident

 16:43 <vorlon> xnox: adduser?

 16:44 <vorlon> aptdaemon blocking xorg-server; flaky test, sometimes it runs in 9 minutes and sometimes it times out

 16:44 <vorlon> juliank: is this anything you would want to look at?

 16:45 <xnox> vorlon:  yes adduser on me.

 16:45 <juliank> haven't we gone over this a bunch of times by now?

 16:45 <juliank> I'm sure I said to force-badtest aptdaemon/armhf/all months ago

 16:46 <rbalint> i'm thinking about an IRC-> hints merge gateway :-)

 16:46 <vorlon> juliank: can you say it again somewhere the release team will pick up on it? (#ubuntu-release or an MP)

 16:46 <juliank> committer: Steve Langasek <steve.langasek@canonical.com>

 16:46 <juliank> branch nick: hints-ubuntu

 16:46 <juliank> timestamp: Thu 2020-07-23 08:45:18 -0700

 16:46 <juliank> message:

 16:46 <juliank> badtest aptdaemon/armhf

 16:47 <vorlon> juliank: ok, the hint got dropped because it was version-specific and the version in question was superseded by the next flaky version passing

 16:47 <juliank> seems it was removed again

 16:47 <vorlon> so, baseline testing

 16:47 <vorlon> would make this go away

 16:47 <vorlon> I will readd the hint

 16:48 <vorlon> node-jquery

 16:48 <vorlon> juliank: can you take this one?

 16:49 <juliank> I can try my best!

 16:49 <vorlon> pcre2, missing builds on most archs

 16:49 <vorlon> doko: can you look at pcre2?

 16:52 <doko> ok

 16:52 <vorlon> python3.8 is fun, I'm not sure why this only fails on ppc64el given that the autopkgtest code has a 'FIXME' that has failed to be commented out

 16:53 <vorlon> doko: do you want to take python3.8 too?  I could add an Ubuntu delta but it might be quicker for you to fix it upstream

 16:53 <doko> ok

 16:53 <vorlon> oh, but I'm looking at the wrong test result - this is about the release python3.8 blocking sqlite3

 16:53 <doko> will wait for 3.8.7 final, then remove it

 16:53 <vorlon> I'll take sqlite3

 16:54 <doko> well, then just hint it, i's not depending on 3.8 anymore

 16:54 <vorlon> sqlite3 has other blockers, I'll follow through

 16:54 <vorlon> coreutils regresses firefox, ok that's fun

 16:55 <xnox> just vendorize coreutils in firefox

 16:55 <vorlon> sil2100: do you want to look at this?

 16:55 <xnox> silence means acceptance

 16:56 <vorlon> and then gcc-10 is just waiting for test results

 16:56 <vorlon> so that's the list

 16:56 <mclemenceau> awesome! thx vorlon

 16:56 <mclemenceau> #topic AOB

 16:57 <mclemenceau> holidays are coming, who is here next Thursday?

 16:57 <xnox> Chistmas!

 16:57 <xnox> not i

 16:57 <waveform> I'll be around

 16:57 <vorlon> not me

 16:57 <rbalint> i'll be
