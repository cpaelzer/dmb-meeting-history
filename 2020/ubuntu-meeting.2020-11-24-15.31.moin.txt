 15:31 <meetingology> 

 15:31 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <cpaelzer> ddstreet: sarnold: jamespage: doko: didrocks: o/

 15:32 <cpaelzer> we had no previous action items other than review assignments for james page, so we can right away go to

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> mostly LGTM with one new entry

 15:32 <cpaelzer> mime-support -> mailcap -> media-types

 15:32 <cpaelzer> mime-support is foundations, is that known already doko?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> ... also giving everyone some time to see the ping and remember the meeting is now ...

 15:34 <cpaelzer> while we are waiting I can already pre-state that this week we have no-new MIR cases and no recently updated incomplete cases

 15:34 <cpaelzer> therefore once "mime-support -> mailcap -> media-types" is resovled we are done

 15:34 <cpaelzer> while waiting for doko everyone feel free to comment if you have anything for "Any other business?"

 15:34 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:35 <doko> mime-support synced/merged by vorlon, I'll ask him

 15:35 <cpaelzer> thanks doko

 15:35 <cpaelzer> that would be everything for today - \o/

 15:35 <cpaelzer> anything for the "open topic" section?

 15:35 * cpaelzer has nothing

 15:36 <sarnold> where'd that esmtp come from?

 15:36 <sarnold> (via logcheck)

 15:36 <cpaelzer> I think that was one of the known false positives

 15:36 <sarnold> logcheck has Depends: adduser, default-mta | mail-transport-agent .. and I can only spot postfix via default-mta

 15:36 <cpaelzer> whith alternative dependencies and germinate picking a random one

 15:37 <sarnold> aha

 15:37 <sarnold> then I've just got goldfish memory, okay :)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> we last talked about it on 15th Sept

 15:40 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/germinate/+bug/1895011

 15:40 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1895011 in germinate (Ubuntu) "virtual-packages do not pick a seeded package (ordering dependent)" [Undecided,New]

 15:40 <cpaelzer> you fail to see it as it only happens that (broken) way on i386

 15:40 <cpaelzer> goldfish refilled :-)

 15:40 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 15:41 <sarnold> lol, thanks :)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> np

 15:42 <cpaelzer> seems we are good for today then

 15:42 <sarnold> cool, thanks cpaelzer, cpaelzer :)

 15:42 <cpaelzer> letting everone back to the TG week

 15:42 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
