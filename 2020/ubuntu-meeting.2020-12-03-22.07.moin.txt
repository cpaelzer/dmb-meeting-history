 22:07 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 22:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 22:07 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Dec  3 22:07:12 2020 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:07 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 22:07 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 22:07 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:07 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:07 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:07 <Wild_Man> Got over excited

 22:07 <diddledan> :-p

 22:08 <bashfulrobot> The excitement shows... ü§™

 22:09 <bashfulrobot> I think we can kick off the applicant introductions now. üëç

 22:10 <madhens> Which of us is going first?

 22:10 <Wild_Man> Will madhens please start

 22:11 <Wild_Man> madhens , please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 22:12 <madhens> My name is Monica Ayhens-Madon, and I have been an Ubuntu contributor since late January of 2020. I am a member of the Ubuntu MATE core team (documentation), and I also help coordinate the official #ubuntu-flavors by coordinating quarterly meetings. I've felt very welcomed by the Ubuntu community since I started becoming more involved in 2019, and I'm applying for membership because I want to keep making a

 22:12 <madhens> meaningful impact. My Wiki is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/madhens and my LP is https://launchpad.net/~madhens

 22:14 <bashfulrobot> madhens: since I'm already familiar with certain components of your work. My questions revolve more around your future work. I'm curious to know 1) do you have any plans to get more involved in the overall Ubuntu community? I know that you have taken on the role to organize more of the flavor meetings. Plans to expand  Beyond that? And; 2) I'm familiar with the book club that you had organized with Jono on building

 22:14 <bashfulrobot> communities. Is that going to continue in cycles? Or was that a one-time thing?

 22:17 <diddledan> A Jono Bacon endorsement is like gold dust ;-)

 22:17 <bashfulrobot> I was going to say more like unicorn.

 22:18 <madhens> I very much want to keep working with the flavors, and find ways to integrate that cooperation into the broader Ubuntu community. For example, in our last meeting we brought up some issues with the testing channel, and it came up that that is really an issue for the newly reformed board. Also, I want to take an active role in onboarding and helping to rebuild the community, and making all members feel invested

 22:18 <madhens> and motivated and able to contribute more easily.

 22:19 <bashfulrobot> Some great ideas. I know when I came into the community if I had not had a particular individual mentor me, it would have been very difficult to get involved.

 22:19 <Wild_Man> Impressive

 22:19 <madhens> Also,  it's not certain yet, but even if it doesn't continue under Jono's auspices, this community book club has been an incredible learning experience that will keep going, in one form or another.

 22:19 <bashfulrobot> Good to hear!

 22:19 <madhens> There are some core people in the book club who don't want it to end, which is a good sign. :)

 22:20 <Bashing-om> madhens: Granted Membership - what will this spring-board you to accomplish ?

 22:20 <madhens> Same, Dustin. I was lucky enough to have people to help me get started, and without them I would not have made it this far, that's for certain.

 22:20 <bashfulrobot> I think the direction that you're heading in is a great one that we definitely need. And also applying your documentation experience to the overall project could be beneficial as well. Especially if you move it into the larger ecosystem.

 22:22 <madhens> I think that having the membership would give me recognition of my commitment, and the ability to volunteer for a range of leadership roles. But everything after that springboard is hard work and cooperation and empathetic listening.

 22:25 <wxl> congratulations, Monica!

 22:25 <lirrums> Wild_Man okay.

 22:25 <lirrums> Hello everyone, my name is Lina Castro, I have been part of the Ubuntu Colombia team since 2019 (where I am part of my team's LoCo Team Council) and since then I have supported my community in a large number of events and of dynamics throughout these two years, spreading and promoting the use of free technologies, we are currently working very hard

 22:25 <lirrums> on two very important projects for us, which the Latin American community has supported in the best way:Fridaydesktop -> fridayDesktopPodcast ubuntu colombiaIn both I am a leader and in both we have had a great reception, where we have received invitations from many communities throughout these two years, which has made us able to spread the use of

 22:25 <lirrums> technologies and free software in other communities and countries, in addition to We have received great invitations from the Ubuntu touch project where at the moment I am part of the core team as a mobile application developer for the Ubuntu touch team & I also support the initiative from the very foundation of Ubports.this is my LP:

 22:25 <lirrums> https://launchpad.net/~lirrumscode and this my wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/lirrumscode

 22:28 <bashfulrobot> lirrums: it's nice to see a loco that's actually in motion.

 22:28 <wxl> lirrums: how often does this podcast happen? and what is the friday desktop thing?

 22:29 <bashfulrobot> lirrums: it's cool to see some of the mobile development stuff sticking around in the community. What kind of applications are you currently working on? or are you working more specifically on the OS itself?

 22:31 <lirrums> @wxl This podcast occurs frequently every 15 to 20 days, where we have guests or talk about free current technologies.Desktop Friday is an initiative that emerged from Juan Febles, one of the great creators of Linux Podcast, where every Friday LInux users shared their desktop through a scrrenshot with the use of neofetch or screenfetch, at the

 22:31 <lirrums> moment we are motivating that more Latino users join in and thus break the stereotype of Linux, which has been quite great, we currently have more than 100 people supporting this dynamic from different parts of the world.

 22:33 <lirrums> in a group of telegram that has been created from the ubuntu colombia community and the twitters social media from ubuntu colombia too.

 22:34 <wxl> very cool, lirrums! do you have any plans for any events (virtual, i imagine) in the near future?

 22:36 <diddledan> this all looks excellent. I'm not sure if I can think of any pertinent questions that haven't been covered

 22:36 <lirrums> Yes, we have the flisol of the year 2021 that we hope can be held in person, where these dynamics will be held in our agenda, in order to further promote the use and dissemination of free software.

 22:36 <linaporras> She was involved in the FLISoL this year, and hope to have her in the 2021 season, which is in preparation...  Ubuntu Colombia has been participating in this event for many years!

 22:38 <wxl> excellent sounding stuff, all
