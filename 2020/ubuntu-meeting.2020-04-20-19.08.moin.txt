 19:08 <meetingology> Meeting started Mon Apr 20 19:08:31 2020 UTC.  The chair is teward. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 19:08 <meetingology> 

 19:08 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 19:09 <teward> Welcome to the DMB meeting today, April 20th, 19:00-ish UTC.

 19:09 <teward> #topic Review of previous action items

 19:09 <teward> we have quite a few.

 19:09 <teward> - tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:10 <teward> tsimonq2: has there been any change on this, or will this continue to be carried over?

 19:10 <tsimonq2> Carry over.

 19:11 <teward> #action tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:11 * meetingology tsimonq2 to better document what we expect applicants to know (carried over)

 19:11 <teward> - teward follow up with Erich Eickmeyer (flavor lead) RE: a 'core' team for them with upload rights

 19:12 <teward> We've established a new ubuntu-studio-uploaders group which will be the uploaders group for the UbuntuStudio packageset instead of individual uploaders assigned the packageset.  The group is made but access rights haven't been granted yet, pending the tooling being documented by rafaeldtinoco

 19:12 <teward> so that's going to stay as a separate follow-up item.

 19:12 <rafaeldtinoco> k

 19:12 <teward> #action teward to follow up with TB / packageset tooling on ubuntu-studio-uploaders being added to ubuntustudio packageset for upload rights

 19:12 * meetingology teward to follow up with TB / packageset tooling on ubuntu-studio-uploaders being added to ubuntustudio packageset for upload rights

 19:13 <teward> - teward follow up on packageset owning team for ubuntu-mate

 19:13 <teward> Carrying this over, I didn't get to this yet

 19:13 <teward> #action teward follow up on packageset owning team for ubuntu-mate (carried over)

 19:13 * meetingology teward follow up on packageset owning team for ubuntu-mate (carried over)

 19:13 <teward> - ddstreet set expiry time on identified flavor teams

 19:13 <ddstreet> yep, this is done, with 2 caveats

 19:13 <teward> great news!

 19:14 <ddstreet> 1) i adjusted the expiry time for the teams, but didn't adjust the expiry dates for existing members

 19:14 <ddstreet> i wanted to check if there were any objections here to adjusting the existing member expiry dates; if not, i'll do that as well

 19:14 <ddstreet> (i assume nobody will object, just wanted to check)

 19:14 <rafaeldtinoco> +1 from me

 19:14 <tsimonq2> +1

 19:14 <teward> +1 from me

 19:15 <ddstreet> ack, ok i can take action to do that

 19:15 <ddstreet> and 2) i didn't update the expiry time for the new teams for studio or mate

 19:15 <teward> #action ddstreet to adjust existing member expiration dates from packageset owning teams

 19:15 * meetingology ddstreet to adjust existing member expiration dates from packageset owning teams

 19:15 <teward> ddstreet: that's another thing you should probably go and do, even though studio is brand new.

 19:15 <teward> though i'm not sure mate has an owning packageset team yet

 19:15 <teward> again i haven't dug deep on that i ran out of cycles this past week

 19:16 <ddstreet> ack, i can take that action as well - tho as you said, mate will have to wait

 19:16 <teward> yep i'll add an action for studio for you, let me keep digging on MATE

 19:16 <ddstreet> ack, thnx

 19:16 <teward> #action ddstreet to apply team expiration times for studio packageset owning team

 19:16 * meetingology ddstreet to apply team expiration times for studio packageset owning team

 19:16 <teward> alrighty, next item

 19:16 <teward> - rafaeldtinoco to handle request "Expired MOTU membership" (carried over)

 19:17 <ddstreet> did you miss one?

 19:17 <ddstreet> lubuntu pkgset?

 19:17 <rafaeldtinoco> I did for dfiloni

 19:17 <teward> ddstreet: will get that next

 19:17 <ddstreet> ack sorry :)

 19:17 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: awesome :)

 19:17 <teward> and because I missed one

 19:17 <teward> - teward to handle request "Adding lubuntu-update-notifier to the Lubuntu package set" (carried over)

 19:18 <teward> waiting on the packageset documentation, but I think this was or will be handled by rafaeldtinoco with their pending set of reviews for handling the packageset changes this time round - think they were looking at this earlier today?

 19:19 <rafaeldtinoco> yep, tb discussed today

 19:19 <teward> cool then i'll keep that item in place until we get to that discussion during AOB

 19:19 <teward> #action teward to handle request "Adding lubuntu-update-notifier to the Lubuntu package set" (carried over)

 19:19 * meetingology teward to handle request "Adding lubuntu-update-notifier to the Lubuntu package set" (carried over)

 19:19 <teward> - ddstreet to handle request "Please add new printing-related packages to my upload rights into main" (carried over)

 19:20 <ddstreet> yep, this is done, and bug opened with TB, and email sent to TB

 19:20 <teward> great!  thank you for taking that one ddstreet!

 19:20 <teward> - ddstreet to write up a proposal for upload access expiry following some period of disuse (carried over)

 19:20 <ddstreet> carry over plz

 19:20 <teward> #action ddstreet to write up a proposal for upload access expiry following some period of disuse (carried over)

 19:20 * meetingology ddstreet to write up a proposal for upload access expiry following some period of disuse (carried over)

 19:20 <teward> - teward discuss edbuntu conversion to ppu with aklisg

 19:21 <teward> this discussion went well, alkisg indicated that of the packageset other than the two items we recently PPU approved they need tux{math,paint,type},x11vnc ppu'd for them as well which they have from the edubuntu packageset

 19:22 <teward> so i'll review and handle getting those PPU rights assigned, and then we can move forward on future dissolution of the edubuntu packageset.

 19:22 <rafaeldtinoco> lgtm

 19:22 <teward> #action teward to handle PPU rights of tux{math,paint,type},x11vnc for alkisg ahead of edubuntu packageset removal in the future.

 19:22 * meetingology teward to handle PPU rights of tux{math,paint,type},x11vnc for alkisg ahead of edubuntu packageset removal in the future.

 19:23 <teward> going out of order again...

 19:23 <teward> - teward request to add jsunit to the mozilla packageset (olivier.tilloy)

 19:23 <teward> this was done

 19:23 <teward> - rafaeldtinoco look at flavor packageset tooling re: update of ubuntukylin packageset, run tooling to update packageset

 19:23 <teward> and now we're onto the tooling heh

 19:23 <rafaeldtinoco> ok.. so on this..

 19:23 <rafaeldtinoco> I have ran the original tooling we have

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/6VsHCd6cnC/

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> this would be the changes currently

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> im thinking in going for it AND documenting the tooling

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> in this next cycle

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> (as this one was 20.04 last week and busy)

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> this need was born from ubuntukylin need to add ukui packages

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> i checked by hand and there was qt5-ukui-platformtheme missing

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> with the tool.. there are others needed as well

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> and it would update all other package sets with needed delta

 19:26 <ddstreet> so are you going to run the script before 20.04 release, or wait until after 20.04 release and then run the script?

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> open to discussion

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> maybe its too late for 20.04 ?

 19:26 <ddstreet> after 20.04 seems safer to me

 19:26 <teward> seb128: you requested that the packageset information be updated, is this something that needs done immediately or can we wait until after release?  I'm hesitant to apply major deltas during this release cycle/week

 19:26 <teward> (your email literally from today)

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> +1 on doing it later together with documentation

 19:27 <rafaeldtinoco> i thought there were too many changes

 19:27 <teward> doing this post 20.04 with full documentation on the tooling and its working is the safer option and right now I'm all for the safer option while the new DMB members (myself included) get familiar fully with the tooling

 19:27 <seb128> teward, after release is fine I guess

 19:27 <rafaeldtinoco> +1

 19:27 <ddstreet> +1

 19:27 <teward> +1 on after 20.04 release.

 19:27 <rafaeldtinoco> so you can document as a todo for me

 19:27 <rafaeldtinoco> documenting and discussing the delta

 19:28 <teward> #action rafaeldtinoco to complete documentation on existing packageset tooling, and discuss the current (large) delta in the packagesets that need adjusted

 19:28 * meetingology rafaeldtinoco to complete documentation on existing packageset tooling, and discuss the current (large) delta in the packagesets that need adjusted

 19:28 <rafaeldtinoco> tku

 19:28 <teward> yep.  Next order of business...

 19:28 <seb128> teward, just a side comment, but shouldn't those updates be done on regular basis?

 19:28 <rafaeldtinoco> seb128: i have this question too

 19:28 <teward> seb128: i don't disagree with you.  I believe they should during a cycle

 19:29 <rafaeldtinoco> we have some requests for packageset changes

 19:29 <rafaeldtinoco> (single packages)

 19:29 <teward> the tricky part I think is the DMB prior to the latest DMB election has had other duties and or other issues which prevented it getting updated.

 19:29 <rafaeldtinoco> should I drive those ?

 19:29 <seb128> sorry I didn't mean to derail the agenda, that was a side comment

 19:29 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: you can do that, if you wish, as part of the process of documenting the things.  I'll update that in the agenda post-meeting when I update the agenda

 19:30 <teward> seb128: no problem, it's a good time for it.  we'll bring it up as well and set a task for it to be regularly updated.

 19:30 <seb128> thx

 19:30 <rafaeldtinoco> k

 19:30 <teward> moving on...

 19:30 <teward> #topic Package Set / Per Package Uploader Applications

 19:30 <teward> We have two of these to review today.

 19:30 <seb128> :-)

 19:30 <teward> # info Olivier Tilloy for the mozilla package set (Monday 2020-04-20 19:00 UTC)

 19:31 <oSoMoN> \o

 19:31 <teward> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OlivierTilloy/MozillaPackageSetApplication

 19:31 <teward> oSoMoN: welcome!  Want to introduce yourself while we review your application?

 19:31 <teward> (and come up with any questions of course)

 19:31 <oSoMoN> sure

 19:32 <oSoMoN> I'm Olivier, I'm on the desktop team and most of my times these days goes into maintaining packaging for browsers and related software

 19:32 <oSoMoN> I took over the maintenance of firefox and thunderbird from Chris Coulson about 1.5 years ago

 19:33 <oSoMoN> I have upload rights for those due to my belonging to ~ubuntu-desktop, but I lack upload rights for enigmail and jsunit

 19:33 <oSoMoN> which are closely related to thunderbird

 19:33 <oSoMoN> and often need updating together with thunderbird

 19:34 <rafaeldtinoco> oSoMoN: from your wiki page I see another request (as an aside I would like to request/suggest that jsunit be added to the mozilla packageset, it's currently not in it)

 19:34 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: that was handled by me the past week or two, via edit-acl

 19:34 <teward> so jsunit is in the set now.

 19:34 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: good! tks

 19:34 <oSoMoN> teward, thanks for that!

 19:34 <teward> that was filed separately in the devel-permissions mailing list items ahead of this application in the last meeting

 19:35 <rafaeldtinoco> yep! i see it now

 19:35 <rafaeldtinoco> thanks!

 19:35 <teward> thanks for introducing yourself, oSoMoN!

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> +1, tku

 19:36 <teward> does anyone have any questions for oSoMoN on their application?

 19:36 <seb128> ,n

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> o/

 19:36 <seb128> no question, I just want to say that Olivier is awesome :-)

 19:36 <ddstreet> no q from me

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> I have just one.

 19:37 <teward> seb128: thank you for sharing your opinion and support for Olivier :)

 19:37 <teward> rafaeldtinoco: go ahead :)

 19:37 <rafaeldtinoco> oSoMoN: you mention bug triage as a pain in your application, mostly because it takes more time than you would like it to do. i confess sometimes this happens to me as well. what actions are you taking to triage bug in a better way ? have you come to any conclusions to make it more productive ?

 19:39 <oSoMoN> I'm trying different strategies, these days I just read bug reports as they come in, but refrain from properly triaging them everyday, instead I let them pile up for a few days and then do them in one pass

 19:39 <oSoMoN> this lets me focus on other tasks with less context switching

 19:39 <oSoMoN> seems to work well

 19:39 <rafaeldtinoco> sounds reasonable for a packageset.. tku!

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: no more questions from me.

 19:40 <oSoMoN> of course if a bug looks/sounds urgent I just interrupt what I'm doing to triage/investigate

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> oSoMoN: yep, its always tricky to balance.. pilling up a small set of packages is good indeed..

 19:40 <teward> thanks rafaeldtinoco :)

 19:41 <teward> any other questions for Olivier?  (I have none myself)

 19:41 <rafaeldtinoco> just a request for him to keep converting from bzr to git =)

 19:42 <oSoMoN> yes, will do :)

 19:43 <teward> tsimonq2: any questions from you?

 19:43 <teward> or are we ready to vote?

 19:43 <tsimonq2> No questions.

 19:46 <teward> #info Erich Eickmeyer for the Ubuntu Studio packageset (Monday 2020-04-20 19:00 UTC)

 19:47 <teward> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Eickmeyer/PPUApplication2

 19:47 <teward> Eickmeyer: welcome!  Please introduce yourself :)

 19:47 <Eickmeyer> Good evening everyone!

 19:47 <Eickmeyer> I'm Erich Eickmeyer, I'm the current leader of Ubuntu Studio. I've been with the project for two years now, and in that time I have introduced several packages and package updates to the Ubuntu archive.

 19:47 <Eickmeyer> I have upload rights on a handful of packages, but for other packages that are not part of that which may need updating I've been packaging and passing-off to teward for the upload.

 19:48 <Eickmeyer> Getting rights to the Ubuntu Studio packageset would offload some work from teward, who is definitely busy with other items, and would have him on the team to sponsor new packages as opposed to simply updating them.

 19:48 <Eickmeyer> Currently, Rosco2 has exclusive packageset rights, but for the continued life and stability of the project, we would like to have two uploaders, myself and Rosco2.

 19:48 <Eickmeyer> I have become proficient at packaging, but am bound to make one or two mistakes for which teward will gladly slap me upside the head.

 19:50 <teward> (that's not too far from the truth, metaphorically speaking heh)

 19:50 <teward> Thanks for introducing yourself, Eickmeyer!

 19:50 <Eickmeyer> :)

 19:50 <teward> any questions for Erich from DMB members?  (I already drill everything I ask questions on into Erich's head on a regular basis heh)

 19:51 <Eickmeyer> ^ Facts

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> dpf-plugins (1.3-0ubuntu1) eoan; urgency=medium

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> this was a merge with upstream, is that correct ?

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dpf-plugins/1.3-0ubuntu1

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> to make it easier Eickmeyer ^

 19:53 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: at the time, dpf-plugins wasn't in Debian, so no. It was a repackage of what was in the KXStudio repos (which are very, very dirty packages that need cleanup to go into Debian or Ubuntu).

 19:54 <Eickmeyer> rafaeldtinoco: The git repo for the packaging is here: https://git.launchpad.net/dpf-plugins/tree/

 19:55 <rafaeldtinoco> I see

 19:55 <Eickmeyer> Now that I think about it, I may have actually done that one from scratch.

 19:56 <Eickmeyer> Time gets blurry.

 19:56 <rafaeldtinoco> yep, changelog shows it from the beginning being an ubuntu only

 19:56 <rafaeldtinoco> but im glad you pointed the git

 19:56 <rafaeldtinoco> made it easier

 19:56 <Eickmeyer> Yep, I keep the changelog from other projects.

 19:57 <rafaeldtinoco> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hydrogen/1.0.0~beta2-0ubuntu1

 19:57 <rafaeldtinoco> this one was just added

 19:58 <rafaeldtinoco> ok

 19:58 <Eickmeyer> That one was originally from Debian, but they weren't moving quick enough to get the Qt5 moved out, so it had to be manually done. RikMills did beta1, teward did beta2.

 19:58 <Eickmeyer> Did = sponsored

 19:58 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: im good, no more questions

 19:58 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: thank you

 19:58 <teward> Eickmeyer: you also mention in your application a set of packages 'in lieu of the Studio packageset' - are these packages that should be included in the packageset, and if so do you intend to request these being added to the packageset?

 19:59 <teward> (if the answer is yes, then I'm considering them to be added to the packageset once we get the tooling fully fledged out and we can amend the packageset accordingly)

 19:59 <Eickmeyer> They are packages that, if they are not in the packageset, they should be in the packageset. I believe I sent you a list of packages I knew weren't in the packageset that should be included.

 20:00 <teward> I believe you did, but I'm not sure if you emailed devel-permissions with the request as well.  If you can, please send that list to devel-permissions and ask that it be added to the packageset (as you are the Studio lead currently).

 20:00 <teward> I have no more questions, any questions from ddstreet or tsimonq2?

 20:00 <Eickmeyer> I can, but you said you were doing that. :D

 20:00 <ddstreet> no q from me

 20:00 <tsimonq2> No questions.

 20:00 <teward> Eickmeyer: do it anyways :P

 20:00 <Eickmeyer> :P Fine. :D

 20:03 <teward> Congratulations, Erich!  I agree with rafaeldtinoco it'd be nice to see you expanding your package work as well but congratulations on the interim on your successful application!

 20:03 <RikMills> congrats

 20:03 <rafaeldtinoco> definitely! congrats!!!

 20:03 <rafaeldtinoco> and thanks for your work

 20:03 <RikMills> yes, motu next Eickmeyer

 20:03 <RikMills> :P

 20:03 <Eickmeyer> Thanks, RikMills

 20:03 <teward> who on the DMB wants to handle this one or do you want me to simply do it since I know the group in question that Erich needs added to?

 20:04 <rafaeldtinoco> go for it, you already sponsored a bunch of stuff for him

 20:04 <rafaeldtinoco> its like making the honors

 20:04 <teward> heh, true.

 20:04 <teward> We have no other applicants to process today.

 20:04 <teward> #topic Outstanding mailing list requests to assign

 20:04 <Eickmeyer> So, jus to clairfy, do you all think I'd be ready for MOTU now if I applied?

 20:05 <Eickmeyer> Sorry for the sidebar.

 20:05 <teward> Eickmeyer: I'd still like to sponsor some more things if you go outside the Studio packageset, but I think you're a good candidate for MOTU (I still want some more examples and checking but as you know from working with me I'm very thorough with checking things)

 20:05 <Eickmeyer> Ok, that sounds good. Thanks for the clarification. :)

 20:06 <rafaeldtinoco> id like to see universe packages being fixed/merged by you

 20:06 <teward> ^ this as well

 20:06 <rafaeldtinoco> Eickmeyer: going through universe bugs (specially those with patches already pointed out)

 20:06 <rafaeldtinoco> and doing the code work, packaging, test, etc

 20:06 <rafaeldtinoco> will give you good background

 20:06 <rafaeldtinoco> teward: sorry did not want to interrupt you

 20:07 <teward> alls good we can continue now

 20:08 <teward> so barring any objection, who would like to handle this one?

 20:09 <rafaeldtinoco> if all others are +1 (should we vote, I think we already talked about this recently)

 20:12 <teward> I didn't go over in depth the existing mailing list items, were there any ones that needed urgent addressing that I may have missed?  (I wasn't expecting to chair today heh)

 20:13 <rafaeldtinoco> i *think* there is some other packagetset change needs

 20:13 <rafaeldtinoco> but i can review those

 20:13 <rafaeldtinoco> together with the tooling

 20:15 <teward> sil2100 was supposed to chair today, then rafaeldtinoco after.  I'll bump sil and myself to the end of the list as I chaired today.  I was slated to chair the next meeting after sil today but I will be late to next DMB meeting

 20:16 <teward> so rafaeldtinoco is the chair next meeting

 20:16 <rafaeldtinoco> looks good
