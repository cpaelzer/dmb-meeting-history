 20:04 <Wild_Man> #startmeeting 20:00 UTC Membership Board Meeting

 20:05 <Wild_Man> Hello and welcome to the Membership Board meeting!

 20:05 <Wild_Man> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards. We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting.

 20:05 <Wild_Man> If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off. The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:05 <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:05 <Wild_Man> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:06 <Wild_Man> #topic philroche

 20:07 <Wild_Man> philroche , please introduce yourself to the board, and share a link to your LP and wiki

 20:07 <philroche> Hi all, I am a software engineer based in Ireland, I have been using Ubuntu since 2005 and I have been working for Canonical Ltd. since May 2016 on the Canonical Public Cloud team delivering Ubuntu images to public clouds.

 20:07 <philroche> I have been contributing to Ubuntu as part of my day job at Canonical which allows me to touch many parts of Ubuntu for the cloud. My goal as a member is to continue to do so and also contribute to parts of Ubuntu that are not specific to the cloud images.

 20:07 <philroche> My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/philroche

 20:07 <philroche> My LP page is https://launchpad.net/~philroche

 20:10 <bashfulrobot> philroche: what are the other areas of Ubuntu that interest you outside of the cloud images?

 20:12 <philroche> bashfulrobot: I have an interest in python packaging, snap packaging, testing, multipass and nvidia drivers

 20:12 <philroche> And promoting Ubuntu to all that I meet :)

 20:12 <wxl> philroche: you were contributing before joining canonical i presume?

 20:13 <tsimonq2> philroche: What are your favorite and least favorite parts about Ubuntu? (Preferably not related to your experience as a Canonical employee. :) )

 20:14 <philroche> wxl: Not in a direct way via code contributions but via testing, blog posts and helping on forums etc.

 20:14 <philroche> tsimonq2: Favorite is package manager and least favorite is graphics drivers

 20:15 <wxl> philroche: sounds pretty direct to me :)

 20:15 <bashfulrobot> that's cool. It's not always about code ( too rarely code). üëç

 20:15 <tsimonq2> Fair enough, thanks.

 20:15 <tsimonq2> No more questions from me, my vote is pretty clear.
