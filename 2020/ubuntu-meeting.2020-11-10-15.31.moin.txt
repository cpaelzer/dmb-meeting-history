 15:31 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:31 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Nov 10 15:31:35 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:31 <meetingology> 

 15:31 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:31 <cpaelzer> jamespage: didrocks: sarnold: doko: ddstreet: >ping<

 15:32 <ddstreet> o/

 15:32 <jamespage> o/

 15:32 <cpaelzer> we had no explicit action items of last week

 15:32 <cpaelzer> so we start at

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> only the one of proposed has new things

 15:33 <cpaelzer> python-croniter and python-django-compressor are on openstack teams trello borad

 15:33 <cpaelzer> board

 15:33 <cpaelzer> lintian is with doko as usual

 15:34 <cpaelzer> didrocks: you wanted to look as usb-modeswitc/tcltk-defaults

 15:34 <cpaelzer> any insight on these worth to share?

 15:34 <didrocks> I dealt with it this morning, probably missing some publisher cycle or so

 15:34 <cpaelzer> ok awesome

 15:34 <cpaelzer> jamespage: on the two for the openstack team - do you have any ETA?

 15:35 <cpaelzer> for this meeting (and anyone else checking mismatches) even a trivial stub bug would help

 15:35 <cpaelzer> if you intend to drop the dependencies (or MIR them) just open the stub and say what the plan is

 15:35 <cpaelzer> that helps to avoid anyone to "re-evaluate" them over and over

 15:36 <cpaelzer> could you create such stbs for python-croniter/python-django-compressor dependencies later?

 15:36 <cpaelzer> the rest in here are known cases and ok

 15:36 <cpaelzer> I'd go on to the next section

 15:36 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 15:36 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:36 <cpaelzer> empty :-)

 15:37 <sarnold> \o/

 15:37 <didrocks> nice!

 15:37 <cpaelzer> while a lot of transitions happen, notinth tiggers MIRs yet

 15:37 <cpaelzer> nothing

 15:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 15:37 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 15:37 <cpaelzer> recent updates are on known cases

 15:37 <cpaelzer> no action item on those

 15:37 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 15:38 <cpaelzer> it seems from the incoming queues we still have a calm time

 15:38 <cpaelzer> anything else we should discuss?

 15:38 <jamespage> nope

 15:38 <jamespage> nothing from me at least

 15:38 <didrocks> nothing for me, would be great to schedule time in the future to discuss about the golang thread you started

 15:38 <cpaelzer> I have nothing either

 15:38 <cpaelzer> oh yeah you are right didrocks

 15:38 <sarnold> yes, but please not today :) I'd still like to re-read the whole thing a few more times

 15:39 <cpaelzer> I'd also need to context switch that in what the right next step is

 15:39 <didrocks> yeah, security input is the most important part on that IMHO :)

 15:39 <cpaelzer> for now let us all take the action to re-read and make sure it is processed for your own Teams POV at least once

 15:40 <sarnold> debian folks are thinking of doing something to remove golang and rust 'library' packages from their lists in some fashion, to avoid end users needing to download megabytes of Binaries lists for packags they'll never have installed

 15:41 <sarnold> I don't know if tihs is something we'll want to mirror, or will need to adapt to in some fashion

 15:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold: give the thread a read, discuss it with the team and come back to us if it will work for you

 15:41 <sarnold> https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2020/11/msg00104.html

 15:41 <cpaelzer> atm I'm more concerned at over-and-over "burning many engineer-hours in the process to then give up"

 15:42 <sarnold> yes

 15:42 <cpaelzer> intersting sarnold

 15:42 * didrocks will read

 15:42 <cpaelzer> doko also had a great link replied to that thread

 15:42 <cpaelzer> worth a read as well

 15:42 <sarnold> and it does seem like because we always give up, we never get the benefits of shared efforts :(

 15:42 <cpaelzer> that is part of the story

 15:43 <cpaelzer> and that every step you distance from upstream puts upstreams-burden onto our shoulders

 15:43 <cpaelzer> thanks for keeping that active

 15:43 <cpaelzer> I think we are ok for today then

 15:43 <cpaelzer> anything else before we close?

 15:43 <sarnold> that's it for me, thanks

 15:44 <didrocks> same

 15:44 <cpaelzer> then thanks everyone, see you next week

 15:44 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
