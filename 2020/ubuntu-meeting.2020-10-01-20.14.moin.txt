 20:14 <diddledan> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board

 20:14 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu Oct  1 20:14:45 2020 UTC.  The chair is diddledan. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 20:15 <tai271828> \o/

 20:15 <diddledan> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1st October 2020. The wiki page for the Review Boards are available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 20:15 <diddledan> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 20:16 <diddledan> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 20:16 <diddledan> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 20:16 <diddledan> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 20:16 <diddledan> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the majority of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 20:16 <diddledan> Now, with any further ado, lets get started with the first applicant...

 20:16 <diddledan> #topic tai271828

 20:16 * tai271828 is reading

 20:17 <diddledan> Hi, tai271828, could you introduce yourself and link to your wiki page please? The board will take a moment to read through your page and then we'll get to questions

 20:17 <bashfulrobot> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tai271828 (have it handy)

 20:18 <tai271828> thank bashfulrobot

 20:18 <tai271828> I have been using Ubuntu since 2006 and it is 6.06 (Dapper Drake), and I have been working for Canonical Ltd. for 7 years since 2013.

 20:18 <tai271828> I was an experimental particle physic scientist to try to improve the measurement of the neutrino mass in the Dayabay collaboration. For loving science and FLOSS software, I spent a lot of my time to combine both of them. A good daily machine with a good distribution is a foundation to let me engage myself to devote my energy to work on them (FLOSS and science), so I would like to work on Ubuntu.

 20:18 <tai271828> and my wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tai271828 (re-paste again)

 20:19 <oerheks> impressive reading, tai !!

 20:19 <diddledan> yup, there's lots to like! :-)

 20:19 <bashfulrobot> super strong

 20:20 <tai271828> thank you very much : D

 20:20 <Wild_Man> Very impressive

 20:20 <Maik> nice one tai271828. respect.

 20:21 <diddledan> ok. I'll open the floor for any questions from the board delegates

 20:21 <Wild_Man> I have no questions looks very strong

 20:21 <diddledan> me too, I don't have any questions, either :-)

 20:21 <oerheks> I do know not all Canonical workers are member too, What makes you take this step today?

 20:22 <tai271828> oerheks: there are two reasons:

 20:23 <tai271828> 1) one for my daily job so I could triage public bugs on Launchpad more easily for working on arm server enablement recently if I am granted the ubuntu membership permission

 20:24 <tai271828> 2) The other is for my personal commitment. I regard myself as a member of Ubuntu community (at least for the local community) for years but not seriously take more actions besides giving some short and small knowledge, user experience, or best practice sharing with friends from my local community. I should and I could promote Ubuntu with a more proactive mindset. By getting the membership it means something

 20:24 <tai271828> ritual for me to make a commitment to myself and the community.

 20:26 <Wild_Man> Only candidate and board members should be asking questions or talking at this time please

 20:26 <bashfulrobot> I had read the wiki entry earlier today, and found it to be very comprehensive. So I have no further questions and I am ready to vote.

 20:26 <bashfulrobot> (not to rush things)

 20:27 <Wild_Man> I am ready to vote

 20:27 <diddledan> okie dokie.. if everyone's ready I'll fire off the voting bot
