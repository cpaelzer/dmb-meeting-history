 15:29 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 15:29 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Nov  3 15:29:55 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 15:29 <meetingology> 

 15:29 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 15:30 <cpaelzer> initial ping for jamespage didrocks1 ddstreet doko sarnold

 15:30 <didrocks1> hey

 15:30 <doko> hi

 15:31 <sarnold> good morning

 15:31 <cpaelzer> ok slowly we are a crowd :-) let us get started

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 15:31 <cpaelzer> none

 15:31 <cpaelzer> :-)

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 15:31 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 15:32 <cpaelzer> the normal one is rather clean still

 15:32 <cpaelzer> but the re-opening of auto-sync brought a bunch for -proposed

 15:32 <cpaelzer> ignoring the known non-issues

 15:32 <cpaelzer> we have a few to mention

 15:32 <cpaelzer> postgresql-13 - that is on me to prepare and eventually will not be a full MIR

 15:32 <cpaelzer> it will replace v12 with v13

 15:33 <cpaelzer> but really new and worth to bring up are the new deps for

 15:33 <cpaelzer> 1. python-django-compressor

 15:33 <cpaelzer> 2. golang-defaults

 15:33 <cpaelzer> 3. python.croniter

 15:33 <cpaelzer> 4. usb-modeswitch

 15:33 <cpaelzer> does any of them feel clearly at home within one team to own it?

 15:33 <cpaelzer> I'd assume golang will also just replace the former version once it is ready to transition

 15:34 <cpaelzer> doko:  do you happen to know more about golang?

 15:34 <didrocks1> not really at home, but I think I am the most familiar with golang here

 15:34 <doko> no, I pinged michael, but didn't get a reply yet

 15:34 <didrocks1> (not really on our packaging, but I can look)

 15:35 <cpaelzer> didrocks: yeah, but don#t overinvest on it right now

 15:35 <cpaelzer> just check the status and if anyone needs to be made aware

 15:35 <didrocks> ack

 15:35 <cpaelzer> on django

 15:35 <cpaelzer> I checked germinate

 15:35 <cpaelzer> that is in got

 15:35 <cpaelzer> for

 15:35 <cpaelzer> python3-django-compressor                                   | python-django-compressor                       | python3-django-openstack-auth

 15:36 <cpaelzer> so jamespage that would be up to you

 15:36 <cpaelzer> not seeing you writ here yet today, coreycb ^^ ?

 15:36 <cpaelzer> that would be three MIRs for python-calmjs -> python-calmjs.types and python-calmjs-parse (well might be one MIR)

 15:37 <doko> usb-modeswitch is desktop, the change by seb128 didn't have any effect. didrocks?

 15:37 <cpaelzer> being so early we can skip that one - but if e.g. next week we don't hear from jamespage or coreycb I'll writ e mail to make sure it is a known todo

 15:37 <didrocks> doko: which change, do you have context ?

 15:37 <cpaelzer> croniter is the same (openstack)

 15:37 <cpaelzer> germinate:

 15:37 <cpaelzer> python3-croniter                                            | python-croniter                                | python3-ceilometer

 15:37 <didrocks> happy to ping him if you point me to the right direction of what has been already discussed :)

 15:37 <cpaelzer> that leaves usb-modeswitch to discuss between doko and didrocks

 15:37 <cpaelzer> I also lack context here ...

 15:38 <cpaelzer> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-modeswitch/2.6.1-1ubuntu3

 15:38 <doko> the usb-modeswitch 2.6.1-1ubuntu3 upload

 15:38 <cpaelzer> talks about tcl

 15:38 <didrocks> ack, will track that

 15:38 <sarnold> it's written in tcl

 15:38 <cpaelzer> thanks didrocks

 15:38 <cpaelzer> that is ... tickling ...

 15:39 <cpaelzer> that is the fou cases we have for today in mismatches

 15:39 <cpaelzer> four
