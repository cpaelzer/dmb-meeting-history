 14:33 <meetingology> 

 14:33 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:33 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ddstreet: doko: didrocks: jamespage: ping

 14:34 <cpaelzer> we had no open actions of last week

 14:34 <cpaelzer> so we get to mismatches

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg

 14:34 <cpaelzer> I've seen james work on those for the openstack team

 14:35 <cpaelzer> doko: the lintian->perl things are on you still

 14:35 <cpaelzer> doko: as is the mdevctl review btw

 14:35 <cpaelzer> we see more and mroe come in via the raspi-common-seed, but so far waveform always filed bugs for them when they were ready

 14:35 <cpaelzer> no need to proactively do soemthing on them for us

 14:36 <cpaelzer> didrocks: I hate to ask but khronos ?

 14:36 <waveform> cpaelzer, I've forgotten the pi-bluetooth one again haven't I - bah, I'll get on that

 14:36 <cpaelzer> ok waveform

 14:37 <cpaelzer> ok didrocks, feel free to answer later

 14:38 <cpaelzer> the mission is clear get kernel to own it (I think that was the last state)

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:38 <cpaelzer> I've cleared a few oem bugs in there as we agreed last week

 14:38 <cpaelzer> what is eft is nfables that opened for 21.04

 14:38 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nftables/+bug/1887187

 14:38 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1887187 in nftables (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nftables" [Undecided,New]

 14:39 <doko> lintian is in the works, waiting for the MIR to be written

 14:39 <cpaelzer> This is an intentional "duplicate" so iptables/nftables will be in main together

 14:39 <cpaelzer> it is described in the bug that way

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: usually security is the biggest victim of too many "covers the same thing" in main, how are you on iptables+nftables

 14:40 <cpaelzer> after all it also is sort of a security program itself

 14:40 <sarnold> cpaelzer: I think this may be one of those things we've just got to do

 14:40 <cpaelzer> sarnold: foundations expects "I think the MIR preparations will be done by the Security Team, who will own nftables itself, too"

 14:41 <cpaelzer> sarnold: do you agree and will you "flesh out" the current MIR?

 14:41 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, yes, this was surprising news for the security team :)

 14:41 <cpaelzer> if so I'd mark incomplete and assign to you, once ready in your oppinion you can set it back and we assign it here

 14:41 <sarnold> cpaelzer: we're a director and two managers down, I can't imagine we'll have time for it this cycle

 14:42 <jamespage> o/

 14:42 <cpaelzer> I know /remote-hug - but it better stays with you until you are getting to it than in the new queue here

 14:42 <jamespage> previous overran apologies

 14:42 <sarnold> cpaelzer: heh, fair enough :)

 14:42 <cpaelzer> np jamespage, you did well last week on the OS-packages - you are excused :-)

 14:42 <jamespage> thanks teach :)

 14:43 <sarnold> :)

 14:43 <doko> sorry about mdevctl

 14:43 <cpaelzer> np doko, maybe you get to it this week - despite the rfreezes it isn't too late for promotions :-)

 14:43 <cpaelzer> sarnold: ok updated the bug

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:44 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:44 <didrocks> cpaelzer: sorry, got connection issues, back now

 14:44 * didrocks scrolls back

 14:44 <cpaelzer> wb didrocks, you only have khronos on your plate (as always)

 14:45 <cpaelzer> in "recent-incomplete" we have malcontent (reviewed by ddstreet) and google-guest-agent related things (not yet ready overall)

 14:45 <didrocks> cpaelzer: I escalated to my manager again without luck, I’ll try to bypass this week

 14:45 <cpaelzer> good didrocks

 14:45 <cpaelzer> furthermore we have nftables that we just moved there

 14:45 <didrocks> but it’s annoying, agree :/

 14:45 <cpaelzer> and a few lintian deps that are of doko ?

 14:45 <cpaelzer> reading the bug

 14:45 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/discount/+bug/1896786

 14:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1896786 in libtext-markdown-discount-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] discount, libtext-markdown-discount-perl (dependencies of lintian)" [High,Incomplete]

 14:46 <cpaelzer> doko: since you filed it incomplete - on what/who is this waiting?

 14:47 <cpaelzer> everything older is known and ok

 14:47 <cpaelzer> waiting for doko to answer if the bug I linked is "ok" in terms of "no action for the MIR team"

 14:48 <doko> cpaelzer: this is just an incomplete MIR template

 14:48 <doko> somebody from foundations needs to write the MIR

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ok and it waits on whom to continue on it?

 14:48 <cpaelzer> ah ok

 14:48 <cpaelzer> answered

 14:48 <cpaelzer> thanks doko

 14:48 <cpaelzer> well, thereby we are good with this list

 14:48 <doko> it's known

 14:48 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:49 <didrocks> nothing for me

 14:49 <cpaelzer> me neither

 14:49 <jamespage> nope

 14:49 <ddstreet> nothing from me

 14:49 <cpaelzer> and doko would have said above I'd guess

 14:50 <cpaelzer> so we are good then

 14:50 <cpaelzer> thank you all and see you next week

 14:50 <ddstreet> thanks, bye o/

 14:50 <cpaelzer> #endmeeting
