 14:03 <cpaelzer> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status

 14:03 <meetingology> Meeting started Tue Jan 14 14:03:39 2020 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 14:03 <meetingology> 

 14:03 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 14:03 <cpaelzer> can you repeat for the log jamespage?

 14:03 <jamespage> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ovn/+bug/1859601

 14:04 <jamespage> context is that we've split the ovn source package out of the openvswitch package (already in main).

 14:04 <cpaelzer> as I said this morning, you already have my ack jamespage

 14:05 <jamespage> the objective for 20.04 is to make OVN the default SDN for OpenStack on Ubuntu

 14:05 <cpaelzer> as its source was in main before it has had reviews and such already

 14:05 <jamespage> so I've seeded the required binaries into one of the server supported seeds

 14:06 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: you need to be the third vote to decide, do you agree that in such a case we can fast-path ack it to be promoted?

 14:06 <joeubuntu> +1

 14:07 <cpaelzer> jamespage: ok I'm setting the bug state

 14:07 <jamespage> ta

 14:07 <joeubuntu> for the reasons cpaelzer and jamespage  laid out.

 14:07 <cpaelzer> jamespage: only it is listed as "unsubscribed"

 14:07 <cpaelzer> jamespage: could you do the pkg-subscription for openstack team whie I change state

 14:07 <jamespage> I sorted that out this morning - might not have refreshed yet

 14:07 <cpaelzer> ah ok thanks

 14:08 <cpaelzer> jamespage: the update is done, you just need to get an AAs attention as usual

 14:09 <cpaelzer> other cases for discussion from you jamespage?

 14:09 <jamespage> ta - no rush I'll chase one down if it does not happne

 14:09 <jamespage> no - I think ceph-iscsi and nfs-ganesha are both with joeubuntu and the security team for review

 14:09 <cpaelzer> ok then topic switch - I have an own bug(s) to discuss

 14:09 * jamespage listens

 14:10 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/containerd/+bug/1819761 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runc/+bug/1817336

 14:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1819761 in containerd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] containerd" [Undecided,New]

 14:10 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1817336 in runc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] runc" [Undecided,New]

 14:10 <cpaelzer> last discussed on the engineering sprint

 14:10 <cpaelzer> let me summarize the background

 14:10 <cpaelzer> 1. plenty of golang dependencies

 14:10 <cpaelzer> 2. comes with the deps vendorized

 14:10 <cpaelzer> 3. we were tasked to anaylze the dependencies if some of them are packaged

 14:11 <cpaelzer> 4. this is a special case as runc/containerd will NOT stay at their version, they will get regular bumps to new major versions

 14:11 <cpaelzer> like we did with docker.io in the past

 14:11 <jamespage> and so their dependencies will change over time as well right

 14:11 <jamespage> ?

 14:11 <cpaelzer> yes jamespage, they will update

 14:11 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: no, technically not a member anymore

 14:12 <cpaelzer> cyphermox: :-/ but still o/

 14:12 <cpaelzer> therefore the decision in Paris was that we'd want dependencies that have extra packages alrady in main (e.g. due to LXD work in the past) to use these packages

 14:12 <cyphermox> cpaelzer: MIR is Canonical-specific, AFAIK; since I'm not Canonical anymore, I wouldn't necessarily be representing the best interests, but I'll be happy to give you my opinion on software when asked :)

 14:13 <cpaelzer> if on a bump the vendored dependencies are needed on a newer level we'd swicth from package to vendored dependency

 14:13 <cpaelzer> while the other vendored dependencies (since they'd move anyway and have no initial better review-path) can stay vendored

 14:13 <cpaelzer> now the analysis is complete and was added to the bugs

 14:13 <cpaelzer> TL;DR: none of the dependencies are in main already

 14:14 <jamespage> concern - both juju and lxd are no longer shipped in the archive so are they archive maintainers for the packages that have been split out

 14:14 <jamespage> ?

 14:14 <jamespage> they/there

 14:14 <cpaelzer> yes they are still

 14:14 <jamespage> I suspect the LXD team where probably doing some of them

 14:14 <cpaelzer> as usual with a MIR who brought it in owns it

 14:14 <cpaelzer> but they might have dropped to universe since then

 14:15 <jamespage> are they also in Debian?

 14:15 <cpaelzer> most, but not all are packaged in Debian/Ubuntu

 14:15 <jamespage> just considering that if they are Ubuntu only and end up with no reverse depends they might pop up on a potential to remove list

 14:16 <jamespage> TBH I struggle to hate vendoring - on the one side I appreciate that its not the distro model and muddies the view of the world

 14:16 <jamespage> on the other hand - its what upstream have tested with...

 14:16 <jamespage> that said we've taken a similar approach in ceph

 14:16 <joeubuntu> as long as we can  easily track the versions in the vendored code I am not against it.

 14:16 <jamespage> (and that's not go)

 14:16 <cpaelzer> jamespage: joeubuntu: what I'd want from you know is considering the above; the Paris discussion if you remember; and the bugs; then with me discuss/ack that we'll go forward on this case with the MIR and security review keeping dependencies vendored

 14:17 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: ^^ if you want to chime in as well

 14:17 <joeubuntu> I think we should proceed as planned in Paris .

 14:17 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: ahasenack were the ones working on prepping the MIRs and the package

 14:17 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: ok, that would mean since nothing is in main we keep all vendored then

 14:18 <jamespage> tbh I think that's the reality of where the packages would be in 6-9 months anyway

 14:18 <jamespage> so at least if we've reviewed whats vendored we have a know good startline...

 14:18 <doko> sorry, typing too much ...

 14:18 <joeubuntu> We've got the ability to track it on our end, so I'm cool with it.

 14:19 <cpaelzer> ok, I'd MIR ack the bugs then and "all that is left" is the security review then (a lot I know)

 14:19 <cpaelzer> it already is assigned to security and on their trello

 14:19 <cpaelzer> doko: anything to add since you are now with us?

 14:19 <cpaelzer> we can give you a few min to inhale all the backlog here :-)

 14:20 <joeubuntu> As an update we are down to 9 MIRs from a high of 14 in December.

 14:20 <doko> not from my side

 14:20 <kanashiro> do you mean a way to track the diff of vendorized deps between versions in both packages?

 14:21 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: joeubuntu and all of seucrity will need to track if containerd has dependency A at version 1.2.3

 14:21 <joeubuntu> kanashiro , if that is for me, we have the ability to track the version of vendorized code in all vendored packages

 14:22 <cpaelzer> in case 1.2.3 becomes known to be affected to know that we also need to change the package that vendorized it

 14:22 <joeubuntu> I can't recall the details of how... but the tools exist.

 14:22 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: have you added the result of the package anylasis to both bugs already runc and containerd?

 14:22 <cpaelzer> anylasis->analysis

 14:23 <kanashiro> cpaelzer, I just need to add a comment to containerd bug, but I have it in my notes

 14:23 <ahasenack> note we will have potentially two versions of vendor code in the archive: the package in universe, and the vendored code inside runc/containerd

 14:23 <cpaelzer> I only see it on the runc bug

 14:23 <cpaelzer> kanashiro: ok please add it there

 14:23 <kanashiro> runc ibug is ok

 14:23 <cpaelzer> ahasenack: yeah but that (two versions) is the natural consequence of vendorizing

 14:23 <ahasenack> yep

 14:23 <cpaelzer> ok I conclude that we are ok and will update the bug then

 14:24 <cpaelzer> lets go on with the tail end of the "normal" MIR meeting

 14:24 * kanashiro is copying and pasting his notes regarding containerd now

 14:24 <cpaelzer> #topic Review of previous action items

 14:24 <cpaelzer> I'm not aware of recent action items

 14:24 <cpaelzer> anything for you others?

 14:25 <cpaelzer> ok - I take that as a no, then ...

 14:25 <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

 14:25 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:25 <cpaelzer> there is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gamemode/+bug/1853830

 14:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1853830 in gamemode (Ubuntu) "[MIR] gamemode" [Undecided,New]

 14:25 <cpaelzer> from the Desktop team or Wimpress

 14:26 <cpaelzer> anyone having extra context on that one?

 14:27 <cpaelzer> didrocks: I know you are not here - but you'll read thids ping. Could you clarify if this is up for review or waiting on anything else?

 14:27 <cpaelzer> It is there quite some time for not being mentioned before, therefore a pre-check by someone close to desktop could be useful

 14:27 <cpaelzer> next list

 14:28 <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

 14:28 <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir

 14:29 <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usbguard/+bug/1816548

 14:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1816548 in usbguard (Ubuntu) "[MIR] usbguard" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:29 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: did you (=security) and any desktop member get further on this one?

 14:29 <cpaelzer> last was an update by jdstrand missing still some fixes

 14:30 <cpaelzer> seb128 isn't here, didrocks could you ask internally if Desktop wants to re-emphasize or drop the efforts on usbguard?

 14:31 <joeubuntu> cpaelzer It is still in progress by jdstrand

 14:31 <cpaelzer> should it move from incomplete to new then?

 14:31 <cpaelzer> as incomplete indicates waiting on the reporter

 14:32 <joeubuntu> Let me check with jdstrand when he comes back.

 14:32 <cpaelzer> ok, you have the powers to set tat state then if he agrees

 14:32 <joeubuntu> yup

 14:32 <cpaelzer> the last I see worth for discussion is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061

 14:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 711061 in openjpeg2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] openjpeg2" [High,Incomplete]

 14:33 <cpaelzer> had security review a) https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061/comments/62

 14:33 <cpaelzer> which let doko set it to incomplete

 14:33 <cpaelzer> then a lot of things happened

 14:33 <cpaelzer> and we got https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061/comments/71

 14:33 <cpaelzer> which is security review (b)

 14:34 <cpaelzer> doko: joeubuntu: Is that ready for promotion now?

 14:34 <cpaelzer> as (b) was an ack

 14:34 <joeubuntu> Yes it was acked. promote

 14:34 <cpaelzer> doko: or are you waiting on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061/comments/70 ?

 14:34 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 711061 in openjpeg2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] openjpeg2" [High,Incomplete]

 14:35 <joeubuntu> cpaelzer hold on,

 14:35 <cpaelzer> holing ... :-)

 14:35 <cpaelzer> +d

 14:36 <joeubuntu> I  may be wrong...

 14:36 <cpaelzer> I also don't see desktop-packages subscribed

 14:37 <joeubuntu> I thought it was done, let me check with the team and get back via email.

 14:37 <cpaelzer> joeubuntu: you could check with the team and then do a small update on the bug maybe?

 14:37 <cpaelzer> directly on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjpeg2/+bug/711061

 14:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 711061 in openjpeg2 (Ubuntu) "[MIR] openjpeg2" [High,Incomplete]

 14:37 <joeubuntu> will do

 14:38 <cpaelzer> thanks

 14:38 <cpaelzer> so I guess we unblcoked all we heard about

 14:38 <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?

 14:38 <cpaelzer> we had the two big discussion in the beginning

 14:38 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> ... no?

 14:39 <cpaelzer> 3
