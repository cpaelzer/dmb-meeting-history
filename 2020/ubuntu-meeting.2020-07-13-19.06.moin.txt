 19:11 <rafaeldtinoco> #title Outstanding mailing list requests to assign

 19:11 <rafaeldtinoco> oops

 19:11 <rafaeldtinoco> #topic Outstanding mailing list requests to assign

 19:12 <rafaeldtinoco> ddstreet: there is a req for a delegate team

 19:12 <rafaeldtinoco> to a list of packages.. I believe we have to ask AA for the team creation putting dmb as the administrator

 19:12 <rafaeldtinoco> like you did before, right ?

 19:12 <rafaeldtinoco> Request for delagate team for DKMS modules (Francis Ginther)

 19:13 <rafaeldtinoco> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2020-July/001539.html

 19:13 <ddstreet> we are able to create the team ourself, but creation of the packageset has to be sent to the TB, at least that's my understanding

 19:13 <rbasak> o/

 19:13 <rbasak> I think there are two separate requests here really.

 19:14 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: go ahead pls

 19:14 <rbasak> One is to create an appropriate packageset for DKMS uploads

 19:14 <rbasak> The other is to delegate membership management of that team.

 19:14 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 19:14 <rbasak> IMHO, it'll be easier if we treat them separately

 19:14 <rafaeldtinoco> sounds fair

 19:14 <rafaeldtinoco> need a volunteer for those

 19:15 <rafaeldtinoco> (as im already late for the pkgset scripts)

 19:15 <rbasak> They're both decisions that will need voting on by the board as a whole I think

 19:15 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: even if the given users

 19:15 <rafaeldtinoco> already have permissions ?

 19:15 <rbasak> One complicating factor here is that the DKMS fixing packageset can probably be expected to have quite a bit of overlap with uploaders of those packages

 19:15 <rbasak> rafaeldtinoco: I don't think they do?

 19:16 <rafaeldtinoco> yep likely not (perhaps colin only ?) but yep, they dont

 19:16 <rbasak> fginther: ^ am I right about that?

 19:16 <rbasak> overlap with uploaders of those packages> eg. virtualbox

 19:17 <fginther> rbasak, you mean folks like colin already having per-package upload rights to some of those? Yes, I think there will be a few cases of this.

 19:17 <rbasak> That may need coordination with people who generally upload that package.

 19:17 <rbasak> fginther: yes, but really I mean the inverse - are there people who cannot currently upload those packages?

 19:17 <rbasak> (in the proposed list of members)

 19:18 <fginther> Yes, some of the people on the list I proposed do not already have access to any of these packages

 19:18 <fginther> they have may uploads through sponsors only

 19:18 <rbasak> Thanks

 19:19 <rbasak> On the complicating factor I mentioned about, the complication in my view is that it seems odd to me that when an existing team is already close to a package, a separate team (eg. the DKMS maintainence team) would decide for themselves to add new people who can upload that package without reference to the team that generally maintains it.

 19:20 <rbasak> Though, to be clear, this is clearly a good thing that we want to enable :)

 19:20 <teward> oops i'm late

 19:20 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: what if we consider this a seed ?

 19:20 <rafaeldtinoco> "like a seed"

 19:20 <sil2100> Same here

 19:20 <rbasak> (that the people who volunteer to keep the DKMS packages in good shape not be blocked, that is)

 19:21 <rafaeldtinoco> and we can have voting in adding/removing ppl from the "seed"

 19:21 <rbasak> rafaeldtinoco: that's fine but it's the same difficulty as we already have with seeds I think. How overlaps are handled has never been very well defined

 19:21 <rafaeldtinoco> to gain rights etc

 19:21 <rafaeldtinoco> ppu rights would be still kept (per package basis)

 19:21 <rafaeldtinoco> the whole list would be managed as a pkgset

 19:21 <rafaeldtinoco> and we would vote to add new developers

 19:22 <rafaeldtinoco> just like ubuntustudio or xubuntu, etc

 19:22 <rbasak> Sure - I think that's the proposal :)

 19:22 <rafaeldtinoco> should a seed be created then (first ?)

 19:23 <rafaeldtinoco> with all those pkgs

 19:23 <rbasak> I'm not sure why we need a seed

 19:23 <rbasak> Can this just be a packageset?

 19:23 <rafaeldtinoco> well adding/removing pkgs from the seed

 19:23 <rafaeldtinoco> would turn this automatically managed

 19:23 <rbasak> "Packages that ship DKMS modules that need updating to support new kernel version"

 19:23 <rbasak> "Packages that ship DKMS modules that need updating to support new kernel versions"

 19:24 <rbasak> We can add/remove packages to a packageset just the same as we can to a seed

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> we do, yep

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> not automatically, but yep

 19:24 <rbasak> Changing seeds is also not automatic :)

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> ok

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> sounds good.. im 1/2 suggesting 1/2 asking

 19:24 <rafaeldtinoco> using your experience

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> #chair rbasak

 19:25 <meetingology> Current chairs: rafaeldtinoco rbasak

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> mind adding the actions ?

 19:25 <rbasak> We haven't decided anything yet!

 19:25 <rafaeldtinoco> to create the pkgset with all those packages

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> and then we would have to vote individually

 19:26 <rbasak> Sure - but we still need to decide on criteria and process for adding uploaders to that packageset

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> to add them to a team having rights

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> i see

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> having work sponsored ?

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> on dkms packages ?

 19:26 <rafaeldtinoco> (like MOTU ?)

 19:27 <rbasak> Sponsored by whom? Who is allowed to be a sponsor for these packages, and how do we decide who can do that? That's what we need to decide.

 19:27 <rafaeldtinoco> fginther: who has been sponsoring (majorly) the work ?

 19:28 <rbasak> That's a good question. Can the existing sponsors speak to the appropriateness of the request and the initial proposed member list?

 19:28 <fginther> I believe mostly Alberto Milone and Timo Aaltonen

 19:32 <rbasak> Can we ask them what level of endorsement they're willing to provide for the invididual proposed initial members to be uploading to these packages?

 19:32 <rbasak> That's how a normal PPU application would work, and it makes sense to me as a starting point for this more complex request.

 19:33 <rbasak> (I don't think a new delegate team has been created in at least ten years!)

 19:33 <rafaeldtinoco> rbasak: are you thinking on enabling sponsors/coredevs (to this delegate team) first

 19:33 <rafaeldtinoco> and then going 1 by 1 in the application according to their application ?

 19:33 <rbasak> rafaeldtinoco: core devs can already upload/sponsor these pacakges

 19:34 <rafaeldtinoco> yep, i know (just did a edit-acl query on both)

 19:34 <rbasak> Oh

 19:34 <rbasak> You mean for delegation decisions

 19:34 <rafaeldtinoco> yep

 19:34 <rbasak> Because of the complication I mentioned above, I'm not sure it even makes sense for the delegate team to the same as the uploading team in this case.

 19:34 <rbasak> It's not like it's a team responsible for their own product

 19:35 <rbasak> eg. if the kernel team makes a mess of kernel packaging, the kernel team have to clean up the mess

 19:35 <rbasak> But that's not necessarily the case if someone drives by fixing a DKMS issue (good) at the cost of the rest of the packaging (bad)

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> yep we have some crossed things here

 19:36 <rbasak> Here's what I propose

 19:36 <rbasak> to make progress

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> ohhh

 19:36 <rafaeldtinoco> dpdk should get out of this list

 19:36 <rbasak> We start by agreeing to create a packageset for this, though there's no reason to actually create it until we have uploaders.

 19:37 <rbasak> We ask existing sponsors for endorsements for an initial set of uploaders, and judge them by normal standards as we might for PPU.

 19:37 <rafaeldtinoco> asking sponsored uploads ?

 19:37 <rafaeldtinoco> (so we can check ?)

 19:38 <rbasak> I would add two requirements for uploaders acting under the privilege of this packageset: 1) that they coordinate as required by the teams that already handle these packages - if a non-trivial fix is required that has wider consequences than just the DKMS package, for example, that the maintaining teams get consulted first; and 2) no uploading of things not related to DKMS - regular sponsorship

 19:38 <rbasak> required

 19:38 <rbasak> rafaeldtinoco: yes

 19:39 <rbasak> Then we grant packageset uploaders initially without delegation

 19:39 <rafaeldtinoco> (1) merge reviews would satisfy that

 19:39 <rafaeldtinoco> (2) agreed

 19:39 <rbasak> (1) agreed, but I wouldn't want to require them. Some maintenance teams have other workflows. As long as the teams are satisfied that's what matters.

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> for (2) warning about migration and regressions as well (responsible until the migration happens)

 19:40 <rbasak> Yes - all the normal stuff about taking responsibility for uploads applies

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> ok

 19:40 <rbasak> Then we see how it goes, and can consider delegation later.

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> so you would do an initial

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> packageset + PPU ?

 19:40 <rafaeldtinoco> to each of them

 19:41 <rbasak> Yes - creation of a packageset and an uploading team initially managed by the DMB, and we consider adding members to that team individually.

 19:41 <rafaeldtinoco> based on the outcome of the sponsors feedback

 19:41 <rafaeldtinoco> and our voting

 19:42 <rbasak> Right

 19:42 <rafaeldtinoco> sounds nice

 19:42 <rbasak> fginther: how does that sound to you?

 19:42 <rbasak> And does anyone else have comments?

 19:43 <fginther> That sounds reasonable

 19:43 <fginther> Thanks for proposing this

 19:44 <rbasak> Thanks. Let me put a motion together

 19:44 <rbasak> rafaeldtinoco: why did you say that dpdk should be excluded?

 19:44 <rafaeldtinoco> i think cpaelzer takes care of it

 19:45 <rafaeldtinoco> not sure about the kernel modules

 19:46 <rafaeldtinoco> that can be checked/addressed with the pkgset creation

 19:46 <rafaeldtinoco> and taking in consideration that uploads will have to be synced with whoever is in charge of the package uploads usually

 19:46 <rbasak> IMHO, that wouldn't disqualify dkms from this packageset

 19:47 <rbasak> The packageset uploaders would be expected to coordinate with cpaelzer as required, which could mean that cpaelzer continues to take care of it.

 19:47 <rafaeldtinoco> y3p

 19:47 <rbasak> But if cpaelzer is out, the packageset uploaders would still be able to do what is required, which I think is the goal anyway

 19:48 <rafaeldtinoco> makes sense

 19:48 <rafaeldtinoco> i just have one concern

 19:48 <rafaeldtinoco> that is.. about enforcing that this coordination happens.. but we dont have a way to enforce among core devs currently, for example.. so it is the same.

 19:50 <rbasak> All we can do is set our expectations

 19:51 <rafaeldtinoco> ok.. so your suggestion does not require voting, but the upload rights will need

 19:51 <rbasak> Assuming good faith, we can steer people who we think are mismatching our expectations.

 19:51 <rafaeldtinoco> and one of the actions is to ask feedback from the current sponsors

 19:51 <rbasak> Ultimately the DMB can remove people from uploading teams.

 19:52 <rbasak> I think we should vote on the following motions

 19:52 <rafaeldtinoco> yes, and usually on upload conflicts/issues usually a conversation "please sync with me next time" is enough

 19:52 <rbasak> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YW4wTcB6V9/

 19:53 <rbasak> Any comments, suggestions, proposed amendements before I start a vote for these?

 19:53 <rafaeldtinoco> not sure we have quorum (and if we dont id suggest that we continue through the mailing list)

 19:53 <rafaeldtinoco> no questions
