 15:09 <bdmurray> Any questions on status?

 15:09 <bdmurray> Oh I have one!

 15:10 <bdmurray> vorlon: re nodejs I was testing some packages with a m1.large unit and they passed before the nodejs version was reverted. Should we still commit that big_packages?

 15:10 <rbalint> slyon, good job on iwd!

 15:10 <slyon> thanks! There is quite some feedback already

 15:11 <rbalint> bdmurray, i think if the likelihood of passing grows enough with large instances it is worth committing

 15:11 <vorlon> bdmurray: yes, since the new nodejs is coming back eventually

 15:11 <vorlon> (hopefully soon)

 15:11 <bdmurray> okay

 15:12 <bdmurray> #topic Release incoming bugs

 15:12 <bdmurray> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-gg-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:12 <bdmurray> bug 1876737 is new

 15:12 <ubottu> bug 1876737 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "GRUB refuses to boot a 32-bit kernel when in EFI mode" [Low,Invalid] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1876737

 15:13 <bdmurray> Well, juliank seems to have taken care of that.

 15:14 <vorlon> well that's easy enough, it's been marked invalid

 15:14 <juliank> Yup

 15:14 <vorlon> yeah

 15:14 <vorlon> (and I agree :)

 15:14 <bdmurray> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html

 15:14 <bdmurray> some ftbfs bugs have eneded up here

 15:15 <vorlon> curious

 15:15 <bdmurray> doko you did another test rebuild?

 15:15 <vorlon> were these failures present at release time?

 15:16 <doko> bdmurray: did you *read* my summary?

 15:16 <bdmurray> I was so focused on nodejs I must have missed it

 15:16 <doko> how would you know? they succeeded *brefore* the release

 15:17 <doko> there are clearly some ftbfs which were built using -proposed?

 15:18 <vorlon> strace and xz-utils were on the last test rebuild at https://people.canonical.com/~doko/ftbfs-report/test-rebuild-20200327-focal-focal.html#main, pycurl and cryptsetup were not

 15:18 <vorlon> vim was not

 15:18 <bdmurray> How should we prioritize these compared to the groovy ftbfs?

 15:18 <vorlon> they're lower priority

 15:18 <vorlon> but I think we should card them anyway

 15:19 <bdmurray> Okay, I'll do that later today.

 15:20 <bdmurray> bug 1888033 - you set this to critical

 15:20 <ubottu> bug 1888033 in Ubuntu " Check error with 20.04-desktop ISO" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1888033

 15:21 <vorlon> you is apparently xnox

 15:21 <bdmurray> you is always xnox

 15:22 <vorlon> I is?

 15:22 <rbalint> bdmurray, vorlon do we plan doing srus with the focal fixes?

 15:22 <bdmurray> rbalint: for the ftbfs?

 15:22 <rbalint> bdmurray, yes

 15:22 <vorlon> rbalint: these changes are suitable for staging in -proposed and using block-proposed-focal tags, per current SRU policy

 15:23 <vorlon> and this is fairly important so the security team doesn't have to chase build failures as part of doing a security update

 15:23 <bdmurray> Does the security team incorporate changes in -proposed?

 15:24 <xnox> vorlon:  bdmurray: i only respond to vous or You, not lowercase you.

 15:24 <vorlon> they will at least have the opportunity to look there for solutions

 15:24 <vorlon> Vy

 15:24 <bdmurray> xnox: what about YOUâ€½

 15:24 <xnox> bdmurray:  stop shouting, i am right here

 15:24 <bdmurray> vorlon: okay, but is it part of their process?

 15:24 <xnox> bdmurray:  yes

 15:25 <xnox> i can't remember what, but they did pick it up like that, from me for something

 15:25 <bdmurray> okay, cool

 15:25 <rbalint> vorlon, bdmurray  i do see the benefits, but compared to improving groovy i think it is so low in priority that it is not worth carding/fixing them in advance, just when an update is needed

 15:25 <bdmurray> xnox: so about bug 1888033

 15:25 <ubottu> bug 1888033 in Ubuntu " Check error with 20.04-desktop ISO" [Critical,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1888033

 15:26 <vorlon> rbalint: I'm on the fence about this; I have taken that position in the past, but here there are only 5 of them, I think it's worth putting them in the backlog

 15:26 <vorlon> (but then, I may be culling the backlog again soon)

 15:27 <vorlon> xnox: I don't agree with 'critical' here

 15:29 <xnox> vorlon:  i will respond to the bug soon

 15:30 <bdmurray> #topic Team proposed-migration report

 15:30 <vorlon> [LINK] https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs

 15:31 <vorlon> well it looks better than last week

 15:31 <vorlon> bdmurray: are you still on mpfr4 / python-gmpy2?

 15:32 <bdmurray> There is a new upstream version of python-gmpy2 which needs an NMU upload to Debian.

 15:32 <vorlon> but that doesn't block us from uploading it to Ubuntu in the meantime

 15:32 <bdmurray> I'm not a DD so could use help here.

 15:33 <vorlon> any DDs want to volunteer to NMU?

 15:33 <bdmurray> see debian bug 965001

 15:33 <ubottu> Debian bug 965001 in src:python-gmpy2 "strange version 2.1.0 beta4 fails tests with mpfr4 4.1.0" [Serious,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/965001

 15:33 <doko> well, do the upload in groovy first, and see if it fixes the issue

 15:34 <bdmurray> Okay

 15:35 <vorlon> doko: are you still handling the lintian stuff?  I believe you were taking it because promotions were requixred

 15:36 <doko> vorlon: yes, 2.89 just migrated. not sure what I can still do before my vacation

 15:36 <xnox> huray

 15:36 <vorlon> ah ok, so maybe this is all done

 15:36 <vorlon> xnox: python-werkzeug?

 15:36 <rbalint> lintian must be much better being a long test

 15:36 <vorlon> ah you're asking for a removal

 15:36 <vorlon> I'll follow up

 15:37 <vorlon> gce-compute-image-packages: rbalint: is this still blocked on MIRs?

 15:37 <xnox> vorlon:  needs removal. sadly.

 15:38 <xnox> yeah.

 15:38 <rbalint> vorlon, yes, i'm on it

 15:38 <vorlon> ok

 15:38 <vorlon> icu... still in progress, this should be all hands on deck for +1 maintenance...

 15:38 <vorlon> which takes us down to openjdk-8 blocking gcups

 15:38 <vorlon> cups

 15:39 <vorlon> doko commented before that it's wrong for britney to have a custom trigger here

 15:39 <vorlon> nevertheless, someone needs to fix something

 15:39 <vorlon> tdaitx: can you take a look and figure out what's needed?

 15:40 <tdaitx> vorlon: yeah, needs to be blacklisted

 15:41 <vorlon> lapack seems to be new vs last week

 15:41 <vorlon> waveform: would you like this one?

 15:41 <waveform> vorlon, sure

 15:42 <vorlon> libsereal-decoder-perl: maybe just needs a retest with new lintian?  I'll follow up

 15:42 <rbalint> vorlon, i retried

 15:42 <vorlon> rbalint: ok

 15:43 <vorlon> rbalint: but I'll claim it nevertheless for followup :)

 15:43 <rbalint> vorlon, :-)

 15:43 <vorlon> python-future depends on sphinx which has autopkgtest regressions

 15:43 <vorlon> slyon: would you care to take this one?

 15:43 <slyon> vorlon: yes I will

 15:43 <vorlon> (I'll retrigger the failing tests now)

 15:44 <vorlon> glibc blocking audit... rbalint, any insight?

 15:44 <rbalint> glibc test is broken, i file a hint

 15:44 <vorlon> ok

 15:44 <vorlon> systemd migrated

 15:45 <vorlon> gmp just migrated

 15:45 <vorlon> software-properties, ddstreet asked about it on IRC, it's an i386 entanglement; I'll take this

 15:46 <vorlon> and then I think that's it for now

 15:46 <ddstreet> vorlon re: software-properties, https://code.launchpad.net/~ddstreet/livecd-rootfs/+git/livecd-rootfs/+merge/389235

 15:47 * juliank brb

 15:47 <vorlon> ddstreet: I'm not a fan of bypassing modules we have to abstract this in favor of direct url parsing

 15:47 <vorlon> ddstreet: restoring binaries on i386 should be easy; I'll pursue that first

 15:48 <vorlon> bdmurray: anyway, done

 15:48 <bdmurray> #topic AOB

 15:50 <bdmurray> alright, let's wrap it up
