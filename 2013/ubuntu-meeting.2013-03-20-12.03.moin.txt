 12:03:21 <jared> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:03:21 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Mar 20 12:03:21 2013 UTC.  The chair is jared. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 12:03:43 <jared> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for March 20, 2013. The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:04:00 <jared> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:04:01 <jared> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:04:01 <jared> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:04:02 <jared> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:04:06 <jared> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:04:19 <amachu> jared: Hi

 12:04:35 <tvoss> jared, hi

 12:05:54 <jared> Ok, so looking at the page airurando is the first applicant off the ranks. While we read over your application page and wiki if you can please give us a brief introduction to yourself airurando that would be great.

 12:06:15 <airurando> Hi Everyone

 12:06:18 <jared> #subtopic airurando

 12:06:31 <airurando> My name is Mike O'Donohue and I am a very active member and administrator of the Ubuntu Ireland LoCo

 12:07:02 <airurando> my wiki page is located at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mikeodonohue

 12:07:12 <airurando> I am a passionate advocate for ubuntu here in Ireland

 12:07:21 <airurando> I am heavily involved in the organisation of, and participation in, the majority of Ubuntu Events held here in Ireland

 12:07:29 <airurando> Over the past 9 months I have lead the effort to reboot the Irish LoCo in an effort to rekindle greater activity within the team

 12:07:38 <airurando> My daughter is way more famous than me in Ubuntu circles.  Orla was the community pick winner of the inaugural Ubuntu Women Project World Play Day Competition in 2010

 12:07:47 <airurando> I'm a microbiologist by trade

 12:08:01 <jared> #link http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ie/

 12:20:38 <jared> #subtopic tvoss

 12:20:54 <tvoss> Hi all

 12:21:04 <jared> Now we move on to the second application, if you can please give us a brief intro tvoss while we read over the application

 12:21:14 <tvoss> jared, sure :)

 12:21:19 <tvoss> again: Hi all

 12:21:50 <tvoss> My name is Thomas Vo√ü and I have been using Ubuntu since the 4.10 days

 12:21:51 <jared> #voters cjohnston Destine Pendulum jared hggdh amachu

 12:21:51 <meetingology> Current voters: Destine Pendulum amachu cjohnston hggdh jared

 12:22:29 <tvoss> however, before joining Canonical around 11.10, I mostly used Ubuntu and advertised it to friends, family and co-workers.

 12:23:22 <tvoss> When joining Canonical, I spent my first few weeks on ramping up the QA efforts around Ubuntu in preparation for 12.04. I then focused on teaching Chromium pixel perfect scrolling

 12:24:20 <tvoss> before starting to work on the Ubuntu Touch project. There, I designed and implemented the platform abstraction layer that allows us to selectively reuse certain Android drivers and services.

 12:24:51 <jared> tvoss: Just out of curiosity, how long have you been involved in the Touch project?

 12:25:03 * k1l cheers up for tvoss \o/

 12:25:13 <tvoss> jared, in the Ubuntu Touch project (as in mobile)? From the very beginning

 12:25:24 * ogra_ joins k1l and pulls out his pompoms

 12:25:41 <jared> tvoss: cool, just never sure as projects that new it's hard to judge looking at launchpad team membership join dates.

 12:25:46 <hggdh> hi ogra_ :-)

 12:25:56 <cjohnston> What's Mir?

 12:25:58 <ogra_> (to cold here for a miniskirt, so bear with me :) )

 12:26:10 <tvoss> cjohnston, Mir is a next-generation display server

 12:26:24 <ogra_> cjohnston, the systemd of display servers ;)

 12:26:40 <tvoss> right now, I'm working as a technical architect at Canonical, focussing on unity and mir, working towards a cross-formfactor future

 12:26:47 <tvoss> k1l, ogra_ thanks :)

 12:27:04 <tvoss> and that's pretty much me

 12:27:33 <hggdh> tvoss: please give us a bit, discussing it

 12:27:46 <jared> tvoss: I like the inclusiveness of your goals.

 12:27:58 <tvoss> hggdh, sure :)
