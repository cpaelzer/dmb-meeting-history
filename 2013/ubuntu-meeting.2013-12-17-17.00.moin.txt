 17:03 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Trusty Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:03 <ogasawara> The master branch for Trusty remains rebased on the v3.12.4 upstream

 17:03 <ogasawara> stable kernel.  Our unstable branch has most recently rebased to

 17:03 <ogasawara> v3.13-rc4.  Again, we don't anticipate a v3.13 based upload for Trusty

 17:03 <ogasawara> until after the new year.

 17:03 <ogasawara> I would also like to point out that the 12.04.4 point release was pushed

 17:03 <ogasawara> out by 2 weeks from Jan 23 to Feb 6.  This will not have any impact on

 17:03 <ogasawara> the kernel, we will still plan on shipping with the kernel we currently

 17:03 <ogasawara> have going through -proposed.
