 16:00 <adam_g> hi all

 16:00 <adam_g> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <adam_g> arosales to carry out post-meeting procedure (minutes, etc) documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase for meeting of 25 June

 16:01 <adam_g> arosales, any update?

 16:01 <arosales> adam_g, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20130625

 16:02 <adam_g> arosales, cool.

 16:02 <adam_g> Daviey to speak to Percona about Saucy inclusion

 16:03 <adam_g> Daviey, any update on percona in saucy?

 16:03 <Daviey> adam_g: I have emailed them

 16:03 <arosales> adam_g, a couple of week late :-/ but finally got there.  I'll be sure to get it out to the list and blog next time I chair (apologies).

 16:03 <Daviey> awaiting response

 16:03 <Daviey> adam_g: feel free to remove that from the agenda

 16:03 <Daviey> it's inhand

 16:04 <adam_g> Daviey, ack

 16:04 <adam_g> rbasak to land delta report to lp:ubuntu-reports, Daviey to deploy

 16:04 <rbasak> I've got the script ready to go, just need to integrate with lp:ubuntu-reports now

 16:05 <adam_g> rbasak, cool. is there a merge proposal somewhere yet?

 16:05 <rbasak> No - Daviey took me through the code earlier so I know what to do now. You should see one this week.

 16:05 <Daviey> super

 16:05 <adam_g> sweet

 16:06 <adam_g> i'll leave it on the agenda

 16:06 <adam_g> #ACTION rbasak to land delta report to lp:ubuntu-reports, Daviey to deploy

 16:06 * meetingology rbasak to land delta report to lp:ubuntu-reports, Daviey to deploy

 16:06 <adam_g> zul has willfully volunteered to review and document what is blocking server related saucy-proposed migration excuses, with joy.

 16:06 <zul> no joy...apache2 is still making its way through debian and sqlalchemy needs to be done as well

 16:07 <Daviey> following -release channel, apache2 is making progress

 16:07 <Daviey> as is php5 (thanks to rbasak)

 16:08 <adam_g> ok, ill leave that there as well.

 16:08 <rbasak> php5 seems to have reverse build depends blocking migration to saucy now :-(

 16:08 <adam_g> moving on?

 16:08 <rbasak> Some may just need rebuilds

 16:09 <adam_g> #topic Saucy Development

 16:11 <Daviey> rrdtool is our problem

 16:11 <Daviey> Does someone want to volunteer to look at that?

 16:11 <Daviey> might be trivial...

 16:11 <jamespage> ill do it

 16:12 <Daviey> jamespage: maybe someone else? :)

 16:12 <yolanda> Daviey, if it's an easy one i can volunteer

 16:12 <jamespage> if no-one else can

 16:12 <Daviey> yolanda: Super!  Have a look at it and see what it involves?

 16:12 <yolanda> sure

 16:13 <adam_g> Daviey, should be good. both python-markdown and python-tidylib got promoted okay to main. just need a new cheetah that Depends on them, and dropping of our patch there

 16:14 <Daviey> adam_g: super, so next upload?

 16:14 <adam_g> Daviey, yup. stuff got promoted just recently, ill propose a new cheetah package todya

 16:17 <Daviey> smoser: are you looking at bug 1031680 ?

 16:17 <Daviey> Hello smoser.

 16:18 <rbasak> Hi smoser!

 16:18 <Daviey> jamespage: bug 1170393 ?

 16:18 <smoser> hi everyone.

 16:18 * jamespage waits for ubottu

 16:18 <jamespage> bug 1170393

 16:19 <jamespage> tap tap

 16:19 <jamespage> is this thing on

 16:19 <Daviey> jamespage: "Quantum services should be respawned by upstart if necessary"

 16:19 <jamespage> on my todo list still - want to get the neutron name change out of the way first

 16:19 <Daviey> Good thinking

 16:19 <jamespage> there are also some new agents to enable

 16:19 <Daviey> do we have a decent transition path?

 16:19 <zul> Daviey:  its in progress

 16:20 <jamespage> zul has made a start but its pretty ugly for existing configuration

 16:20 <Daviey> jamespage: ISTR you were looking at bug 1196979 ?

 16:20 <Daviey> jamespage: ugh

 16:20 <Daviey> "[MIR] libasm4-java (b-d of jarjar)"

 16:20 <jamespage> mhfjknjsnfdcs

 16:20 <jamespage> forgot about that one

 16:20 * zul hopes openstack will never rename a project again

 16:20 <jamespage> sorry

 16:21 <Daviey> super

 16:21 <jamespage> I think that will probably wash through in Debian first - I'll go talk with a few folks in the debian-java team

 16:21 <Daviey> Any other issues pertinent ?

 16:21 <jamespage> zul, you got the sqlalchemy stuff stored now

 16:21 <rbasak> I'd like to flag https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/1199318. I tried to target it for Saucy but apparantly I still can't do that unless I'm missing something.

 16:21 <jamespage> or is that still all held iup in proposed?

 16:22 <Daviey> rbasak: ugh, i think you need to be core to target.  How silly.

 16:22 <ubottu> bug 1170393 in quantum (Ubuntu Saucy) "Quantum services should be respawned by upstart if necessary" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1170393

 16:22 <jamespage> rbasak, approved

 16:22 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1199318 in apache2 (Ubuntu Saucy) "package apache2-utils 2.2.22-6ubuntu5 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite '/usr/share/apport/package-hooks/apache2.py', which is also in package apache2.2-common 2.2.22-6ubuntu5" [High,Confirmed]

 16:22 <zul> jamespage:  its still held up in proposed, but nova builds with 0.7.9+ now

 16:22 <Daviey> okay, i think we should see if that one is still an issue when apache finishes it's miration/

 16:22 <Daviey> migration*?

 16:23 <rbasak> We can wait. Although I have a suspicion the underlying cause will remain.

 16:23 <jamespage> I think it will be

 16:23 <rbasak> Unless Debian fix it first.

 16:23 <jamespage> what are we talking about now? apache2?

 16:23 <Daviey> yes

 16:23 <jamespage> thats the ubuntu apport hook

 16:23 <jamespage> so its our bug

 16:23 <rbasak> Ah

 16:23 <rbasak> Good point.

 16:23 <Daviey> right, but i wanted to see if it is still an issue when apache2 settles down

 16:23 <jamespage> just needs the right breaks/replaces

 16:24 <rbasak> How'd it manage to move from -common to -utils anyway?

 16:24 <jamespage> one second - it looks like its in both?

 16:24 <Daviey> lets defer it until next week, when the transition should be solved.

 16:24 <rbasak> AIUI, it was in -common before, and is in -utils now.

 16:24 <rbasak> And perhaps both though that's not clear.

 16:25 <rbasak> We probably want it in -common and not -utils?

 16:25 <Daviey> i suspect it did move, and Breaks/Replaces hasn't made sure the old one is uninstalled first.

 16:25 <roaksoax> yeah it seems to be a Breaks/Replaces issue

 16:25 <jamespage> anyway - lets let rbasak sort that one out

 16:26 <Daviey> super

 16:26 <Daviey> Move on?

 16:26 <adam_g> sure.

 16:26 <adam_g> blueprints!

 16:26 <adam_g> #link  http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-saucy/group/topic-saucy-servercloud-overview.html

 16:26 <adam_g> hmm. thats a bad link

 16:26 <Daviey> O RLY

 16:27 <Daviey> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-servercloud-overview.html

 16:27 <Daviey> for some reason aucy was removed... *sigh*

 16:27 <Daviey> adam_g: can you update the template please?

 16:27 <Daviey> (Agenda)

 16:27 <adam_g> Daviey, sure

 16:28 <Daviey> [james-page] Resolve OpenSSL licensing issues with upstream: INPROGRESS <-- is that now done, jamespage ?

 16:28 <jamespage> Daviey, almost

 16:28 <jamespage> first part is in

 16:28 <jamespage> just waiting for headers to appear on the relevant files

 16:28 <jamespage> mongodb MIR may prove problematic

 16:28 <Daviey> ok

 16:28 <Daviey> ugh

 16:28 <jamespage> I need to catchup with jdstand but I've been a bit busy

 16:28 <Daviey> understood

 16:28 <Daviey> rbasak: [racb] Complete and feed arm porting work back upstream: INPROGRESS ?

 16:29 <Daviey> and the other arm work..

 16:29 <rbasak> Oddly my double alignment patch doesn't seem to be needed any more. I need to double check.

 16:29 <rbasak> I very quickly spoke to Jon Masters about the other patch at Linaro Connect. It sounded like he'd be happy to get it upstreamed as-is.

 16:29 <rbasak> I need to follow up on both.

 16:29 <Daviey> oh groovy!  If that is something you can look at this week, that will help improve the blueprint completeness :)

 16:30 <Daviey> roaksoax: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms-ha-v2 ?

 16:30 <Daviey> progress, seems, erm, less than ideal.

 16:31 <jamespage> Daviey, we need to get the python redux out of the way first before we start adding new stuff

 16:31 <Daviey> utlemming / ivoks: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-webscale .. how is that looking?

 16:31 <Daviey> jamespage: what is the current status of redux?

 16:32 <jamespage> most shared code is now into charm-helpers trunk

 16:32 <utlemming> Daviey: with all the cloud stuff, I haven't even had a reasonable chance to look at it

 16:32 <jamespage> glance (roaksoax) cinder (adam_g) and openstack-dashboard (me) all in flight

 16:32 <jamespage> but looking good and working on juju-core

 16:33 <jamespage> adam_g, anything further to add?

 16:33 <adam_g> i expect the remaining python rewrites will all happen quickly with the shared code in one place and functional

 16:33 <jamespage> adam_g, agreed

 16:33 <Daviey> utlemming: would you be able to do a quick analysis by next week.. that is one work item, and may help guide the rest of the blueprint priority

 16:33 <ivoks> Daviey: uh

 16:33 <adam_g> with nova-cloud-controller being the most time consuming

 16:33 <jamespage> I did the openstack-dashboard one in a few hours this morning

 16:33 <utlemming> Daviey: sure, I'll take a look

 16:33 <Daviey> utlemming: thanks

 16:33 <adam_g> jamespage, cool!  i think swift-storage, nova-compute should be <2 hours easy

 16:33 <roaksoax> Daviey: yeah i been concentrated on other things

 16:33 <roaksoax> but I'll get there

 16:33 <jamespage> adam_g, yeah

 16:33 <Daviey> shall we set the goal of having the redux done by EOW/

 16:33 <Daviey> ?

 16:33 <ivoks> Daviey: sorry, ENOTIME

 16:34 <jamespage> actually while we are discussing

 16:34 <Daviey> ivoks: understood.. when do you think you will have time?

 16:34 <Daviey> ivoks: or should we drop it?

 16:34 <ivoks> Daviey: drop it for 13.10

 16:34 * jamespage defers

 16:34 <adam_g> Daviey, i expect the nova-cloud-controller charm to take a bit longer, there are *many* duplicmate variations that need good testing.

 16:34 <adam_g> Daviey, but the others + good progress on nova-c-c should be doable this week for sure

 16:35 <Daviey> adam_g: If we set the goal, can you help identify where other people might be able to help?

 16:35 <adam_g> uh s/duplicmate/deployment... but i like that new word, duplicmate

 16:35 <Daviey> It would be super if we could get it cracked out this week

 16:35 <adam_g> sure

 16:35 <jamespage> maybe without full test coverage

 16:36 <adam_g> ill sync with roaksoax later to see how he is doing on glance, and we can split up the remaning few charms between jamespage, roaksoax and myself

 16:36 <jamespage> works for me

 16:36 <Daviey> super

 16:36 <Daviey> jamespage: yeah, done in principle is the target i think

 16:36 <Daviey> QA & testing next week

 16:37 <Daviey> zul: milestone h-2 this thurs, how are we looking for uploads?

 16:37 <zul> Daviey:  better than yesterday nova is building locally with sqlalchemy 0.7.9

 16:38 <Daviey> zul: Are we expecting a fullu functional h-2 in saucy by eow?

 16:38 <zul> Daviey:  just trying to get people to look at them now

 16:38 <zul> neutron and neurtronclient needs to MIRed again i think dont they

 16:38 <Daviey> zul: what needs looking at?

 16:38 <zul> nova/cinder/python-ceilometerclent so far

 16:39 <Daviey> zul: I suspect neutron needs a ruber stamp, please can you reach out directly to mterry and check?

 16:39 <zul> Daviey:  yep

 16:39 <Daviey> zul: I'd really like to start getting it into UCA on Monday

 16:40 <Daviey> Any other BP stuff from anyone?

 16:40 <Daviey> adam_g: move on?

 16:40 <jamespage> one more thing BP related

 16:40 <jamespage> the one that never show up - ceph

 16:40 <Daviey> Ugh

 16:40 <jamespage> I stuffed a interim release into https://launchpad.net/~ceph-ubuntu/+archive/edgers

 16:40 <adam_g> ... the one that got away

 16:41 <jamespage> 0.66

 16:41 <jamespage> we are getting pretty close to the dumpling release now (august)

 16:41 <jamespage> so its an early preview for testing

 16:41 <jamespage> won't land in distro

 16:41 <Daviey> ok!

 16:42 <Daviey> jamespage: have the BP link to hand?

 16:42 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-ceph

 16:42 <Daviey> ta

 16:42 <adam_g> cool

 16:42 <adam_g> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:42 <adam_g> anything going on?

 16:43 <adam_g> OSCON is next week. i know jorge castro will be there, i will at least be at some of the night events and BoFS

 16:43 <Daviey> This Friday, openstack birthday being celebrated in London

 16:43 <adam_g> i believe there will be an ubuntu server related BOF @ OSCON. ill post the date next meeting

 16:44 <Daviey> (http://www.meetup.com/Openstack-London/)

 16:44 <adam_g> cool

 16:44 <adam_g> moving on?

 16:44 <adam_g> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:45 <psivaa> nothing much apart from this bug for us

 16:45 <psivaa> bug #1197484

 16:45 <ubottu> bug 1197484 in isc-dhcp (Ubuntu) "Connection requests to saucy server VMs from a hosts fail after fresh VM installs" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1197484

 16:46 <psivaa> impacting the server smoke tests. jdstrand is working on to reproduce that outside qa lab

 16:46 <psivaa> that's all from QA

 16:46 <adam_g> psivaa, sounds fun. thanks. let us know if theres anything we can do to help test

 16:47 <adam_g> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:47 <smb> Got Xen-4.3 mostly prepared and running and starting to annoy people with sponsoring requests. Started with some libvirt updates to fix xm stack regression and support 4.3 in the xen driver. Right now wondering about how to make upgrades a bit more seamless (fix paths in xend configs add a script to convert xend persistent definitions into libxl ones for libvirt).

 16:47 <adam_g> smb, o/

 16:47 <smb> Oh and one more thing about xen 4.3: upstream dropped support for i386

 16:47 <smb> on the hypervisor. So I dropped that from building. Not sure one can

 16:47 <smb> do more in order to give people more warning. In theory the combo of

 16:47 <smb> 64bit hypervisor and 32bit dom0 and tools should work but I don't know

 16:47 <smb> how that combo would be mapped to debian packaging..

 16:47 <smb> Apart from those minor details... any questions for me?

 16:48 <adam_g> smb, thanks for the xen update

 16:48 <adam_g> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:49 <adam_g> rbasak, anything new to report?

 16:49 <rbasak> Nothing new to report, really. mongodb ARM patch status as above.

 16:49 <rbasak> I have a golang fix in hand and will upload soon.

 16:49 <jamespage> \o/

 16:49 <Daviey> \o/

 16:49 <adam_g> cool

 16:49 <jamespage> apparently stripping go binaires breaks stuff

 16:49 <Daviey> oh?

 16:50 <rbasak> My reading of Debian policy is that stripping is "should" not "must" so we can drop dh_strip.

 16:50 <jamespage> yes

 16:50 <rbasak> golang upstream doesn't use the normal toolchain.

 16:50 <rbasak> And upstream don't support strip.

 16:50 <jamespage> some binaries where already selectively excluded - we are just increasing the scope a bit

 16:50 <rbasak> They say it breaks things. Evidently it does.

 16:51 <adam_g> #topic Open Discussion

 16:51 <rbasak> I think they might be Doing It Wrong, but I don't know enough to argue. They're upstream, it doesn't break policy so we might as well do what they say here. Given the other stuff we have to do with golang, this is trivial I think.

 16:52 <Daviey> zul, smoser, roaksoax, adam_g, matsubara: you are al rubbish
