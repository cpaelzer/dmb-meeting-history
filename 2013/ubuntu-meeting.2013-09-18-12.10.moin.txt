 12:10 <Destine> #startmeeting 1200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 12:10 <meetingology> Meeting started Wed Sep 18 12:10:46 2013 UTC.  The chair is Destine. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 12:10 <Destine> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 1200 UTC meeting for September 18, 2013.

 12:11 <Destine> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 12:11 <Destine> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 12:11 <Destine> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 12:11 <Destine> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 12:11 <Destine> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 12:12 <Destine> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 12:12 <Destine> So, is everyone ready?

 12:12 <bluesabre> Yes :)

 12:12 <mapreri> sure! :)

 12:12 <mihir> Destine: Yes

 12:12 <knome> most definitely

 12:12 <JackYu> yes

 12:12 <WebbyIT> yes :)

 12:12 <Destine> JackYu?

 12:12 <JackYu> Destine, hi

 12:13 <Destine> JackYu, please introduce yourself to us.

 12:13 <JackYu> Hello, everyone. I�m Jack Yu from China.

 12:13 <iulian> Hi there.

 12:13 <lderan> hello JackYu :D

 12:13 <JackYu> I started my Ubuntu contribution since 2011. I�m now the lead of UbuntuKylin, a flavor of Ubuntu.

 12:13 <JackYu> Here is my wiki:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JackYu

 12:13 <JackYu> lderan, :)

 12:14 <iulian> "Spread Ubuntu/UbuntuKylin to all around in China" -- China is a big country. :)

 12:14 <Jonaszhang> internet make the whole world small:)

 12:15 <jared> JackYu: quick question, what does Kylin translate to or stand for?

 12:16 <JackYu> jared, it's a legend in China.

 12:17 <jared> Ah ok, was doing a quick google and kept coming up with the Ubuntu variation rather than the actual details. Apparently google has learnt all my searching habits well.

 12:17 <JackYu> iulian, yes:)

 12:17 <Destine> JackYu, I think it is a holy animal in chinese legend.

 12:18 <Destine> #voters iulian jared Pendulum Destine

 12:19 <Destine> JackYu, please tell us about your contributions.

 12:20 <JackYu> Destine, sure. My contributions involve many aspects. I think the most important one is to spread Ubuntu to more Chinese.

 12:21 <JackYu> Destine, Firstly, I make it popular in my university.

 12:22 <JackYu> Destine, and then, I started to create a Chinese flavor, with my partners.

 12:22 <JackYu> Destine, and now, we are happily work on it.

 12:22 <Destine> JackYu, sounds good.

 12:22 <iulian> JackYu: Thank you for the information.

 12:25 * popey is here to cheer for WebbyIT

 12:25 <WebbyIT> Hi all, my name is Riccardo Padovani, (http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RiccardoPadovani) from Italy. I'm a studend of Computer Science at first year

 12:25 <WebbyIT> I'm involved in italian LoCo since 2012: I admin the italian website and I have founded 'Chiedi' a Q&A site likes AskUbuntu, but based on open-source software; in these days I'm organizing our meeting. I also collaborate with others project, likes weekly newsletter

 12:26 <WebbyIT> Since July I started to contribute to Ubuntu Touch core apps. Thanks to dpm, popey and boiko support now I am in ubuntu-calculator-app dev team, and I work also on others apps

 12:26 <popey> WebbyIT has been an excellent contributor to the Ubuntu Touch Core Apps project. Reliable, self-directed, motivated, friendly. Exactly the kind of person I'd like to see as a member.

 12:26 <WebbyIT> For the future I want to expand my contribute in ubuntu touch and continue commitments in my Loco. In these days I'm studing, with the rest of web team, a restyling of our site

 12:26 <WebbyIT> popey, thanks :)

 12:26 <mihir> He is committed and dedicated to his work all the time :)

 12:26 <mihir> he helps all the contributers all the time when needed

 12:27 <jared> popey: and the involvement has been sustained?

 12:27 <popey> jared: yup

 12:27 <dpm> I agree with popey: Riccardo has been a key part of getting the Calculator app for Ubuntu Touch to the near-1.0 release it's on now

 12:27 <popey> jared: more than we asked for.

 12:27 <jared> popey: awesome, always nice to see contributions being kept up.

 12:27 <dpm> he's communicative, has got initiative and learns really fast the quirks of Touch development

 12:27 <Trevinho> The involvement of WebbyIT in italian LoCo and event organization is also remarkable... His wiki testimonials already say it, but it's something I also want to remark

 12:27 <Destine> dpm, good to see you here.

 12:27 <jared> WebbyIT: nice wiki application by the way, you've been coached well

 12:28 <WebbyIT> jared, thanks :)

 12:30 <Destine> #subtopic mapreri

 12:30 <WebbyIT> popey, ahahha yeah, I have to open a blog :P

 12:30 <Destine> mapreri, you there?

 12:30 <mapreri> Destine: sure :)

 12:31 <mapreri> Hi! I'm Mattia, and 18-years-old Italian guy (wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MattiaRizzolo lp: https://launchpad.net/~mapreri). I mainly contribute through the Italian LoCo (since a couple of years ago, even if I ask for the ubuntu-it membership only in March) but recently I started to be involved in packaging, with the help of some ubuntu devs (like warp10, but also pitti sponsored a package I merged from debian). In my loco I take care of

 12:31 <mapreri> the translation if FCM and I write articles for the Italian newsletter (and publishing articles on the ubuntu-it website), aside from contributing in varius team (where I can help); I'm also one of the people that admin the social media releations of the LoCo (g+, fb and twitter). Of course I help the spread of Ubuntu all around me (and all around Italy, if possible) ;)

 12:31 <Destine> mapreri, please introduce yourself to us.

 12:31 <jared> WebbyIT: well done, thanks for making our job so easy. Like the others I look forward to reading your blog

 12:31 <mapreri> Destine: just done :)

 12:32 <iulian> mapreri: Do you plan to get more involved with the MOTUs?

 12:32 <warp10> Being one mentor of mapreri during his journey toward MOTUness, I'd wish to remark his committment and engagement. I was quite impressed by how fast he gained skills and his care for details, something important in the packaging world. Definitely a well-deserved membership

 12:33 <WebbyIT> I met mapreri in italian loco, he is very enthusiastic, he totally deserves the membership

 12:33 <mapreri> iulian: sure, but before applying I have to do a lot of more practice :)

 12:33 <iulian> mapreri: I haven't said that you should apply for MOTU membership. Just wanted to know your plans in the future. :)

 12:35 <mapreri> iulian: oh, it should be fine anyway ;)

 12:35 <jared> mapreri: how is the marketing going? Do you have a particular focus?

 12:36 <Trevinho> I can also confirm the mapreri involvment in Italian LoCo is strong and sustained

 12:38 <mapreri> jared: the social-media team (as you can read on my wiki page) it was founded in February and started to operate in March. For now there are not-so-many innovation, even if someone told us that they know Ubuntu thanks to us. The marketing team in Italy is something dead, as in whole, even if some sub-team (e.g socialmedia and newsletter) are still active. I hope we can get the team up again. For now I'm not focus in anything particular

 12:42 * knome quietly hums in the background: humhum, humptidum...

 12:42 <jared> knome: sorry, just reading up links, etc

 12:42 <knome> no problem; just entertaining the crows

 12:42 <knome> *crowd

 12:42 <jared> A crowd of crows perhaps?

 12:42 <knome> that.

 12:43 <knome> my chair sounds like one...

 12:43 <bluesabre> sounds dangerous

 12:43 <mapreri> umh...

 12:43 <jared> mapreri: just reading the links from your wiki to get a feel to ensure the contributions are sustained, sorry for the delay

 12:45 <Destine> #subtopic bluesabre

 12:45 <Destine> bluesabre, you there?

 12:45 <bluesabre> hello Destine :)

 12:45 <warp10> mapreri, WebbyIT: well done. And now I want the beers you bribed me with ;)

 12:45 * knome picks up the ratchet and starts making noise

 12:45 <Destine> bluesabre, please introduce yourself.

 12:46 <bluesabre> I'm Sean Davis (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeanDavis), a Xubuntu team member and developer, and contributor since 2011

 12:46 <bluesabre> I've been working with the Xubuntu team since the beginning of my contributions, when I first started reporting bugs

 12:46 <bluesabre> I've applied previously (a year ago), and now I'm back to try again: http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-09-06-22.12.log.html

 12:47 <bluesabre> Please let me know if you have any questions :)

 12:47 <iulian> Yeah, remember you. :)

 12:47 <iulian> "22:47:30 <bluesabre> Bummer.  Thanks everyone for your consideration, I'll be back sometime after Quantal comes out.  :-)"

 12:47 <iulian> And here you are. :)

 12:47 <knome> i'm the xubuntu project lead; sean has been very helpful from the beginning, and since he has picked up development, he has become even more significant contributor for xubuntu. i'm waiting to get to include pretty much everything sean has done to xubuntu, to make it better.

 12:48 <knome> including a light menu editor and an app to control user preferences

 12:48 <Unit193> I'm part of the xubuntu team as well, and he's quite helpful.

 12:48 <iulian> Very good.

 12:48 <ochosi> xubuntu artwork lead here, just chiming in on that ^

 12:48 <jared> bluesabre: good to see you weren't too dejected after the last attempt and have been open and honest about it now.

 12:49 * iulian nods.

 12:49 <iulian> Am really happy you came back.

 12:49 <bluesabre> jared, iulian: I enjoy working with everyone, couldn't really stay away :)

 12:49 <jared> knome, Unit193 and ochosi - is it fair to say bluesabre 's contributions have continued and not dropped off?

 12:49 <knome> we want to make bluesabre a package uploader, and i think being a ubuntu member is a nice step towards that as well

 12:49 <knome> jared, most definitely! and he's definitely delivering, not just planning and speaking!

 12:49 <Unit193> jared: Of course he has some real life stuff at times, but I'd be worried if he didn't. ;P

 12:50 <Destine> OK, let's vote.
