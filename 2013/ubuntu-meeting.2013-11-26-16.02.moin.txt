 16:04 <arosales> we have an alpha coming up I think . . .

 16:04 <arosales> Dec 19th

 16:04 <arosales> opt in for flavors

 16:04 <arosales> smoser, jamespage is server opting in?

 16:05 * arosales doesn't see utlemming for cloud image confirmation

 16:05 <jamespage> as a core flavor we don't normally opt in - I'm happy to stick with that for alpha1

 16:05 <arosales> jamespage, ack

 16:05 <arosales> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:05 <arosales> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:05 <smoser> jamespage, well, i like to create cloud images.

 16:06 <arosales> smoser, I think cloud images has done an alpha in the past .  . .

 16:06 <smoser> i'd like for us to opt in for alpha1 cloud images, with some actual targets.

 16:06 <jamespage> sure

 16:06 <smoser> the seed-review and gpt

 16:06 <smoser> jamespage, have you done a seed-review email ?

 16:07 <arosales> #action smoser sync with utlemming on building cloud images for alpha 1, targets = seed-review, gpt

 16:07 * meetingology smoser sync with utlemming on building cloud images for alpha 1, targets = seed-review, gpt

 16:07 <jamespage> smoser, urgh - not yet

 16:07 <jamespage> arosales, please action me todo that asap

 16:07 <arosales> will do

 16:07 <arosales> #action jamespage do seed-review email

 16:07 * meetingology jamespage do seed-review email

 16:07 <arosales> onto bugs :-)

 16:08 <arosales> got two high @ http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:08 <arosales> no critical

 16:08 <arosales> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1243762

 16:08 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1243762 in juju-core (Ubuntu Trusty) "[MIR] juju-core, golang" [High,Confirmed]

 16:08 <jamespage> that will stick on the report until either we decide not to or it gets in main

 16:09 <arosales> jamespage, ok, thanks

 16:09 <arosales> bug 1062336

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1062336 in nova (Ubuntu Trusty) "nova-compute expects libvirtd group" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1062336

 16:09 <arosales> zul ^

 16:09 <rbasak> We should perhaps track bug 1248283, since at the moment it seems to affect all MAAS/juju on Saucy, and presumably Trusty too. I don't know how much this needs to be tracked by us as opposed to juju upstream, though.

 16:09 <ubottu> bug 1248283 in juju-core "Juju deploy of Charm in MAAS fails because dbus fails" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1248283

 16:09 <arosales> nevermind jamespage looks like your marked won't fix

 16:09 <jamespage> zul, that will get fixed up under the kvm packaging review

 16:09 <zul> rbasak:  its been removed in trusty

 16:10 <rbasak> zul: what's been removed exactly?

 16:10 <zul> arosales: the xcp stuff has been removed in nova

 16:10 <zul> rbasak:  sorry not you :)

 16:10 <arosales> zul, thanks

 16:11 <arosales> rbasak, you are referring to https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1248283

 16:11 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1248283 in juju-core "Juju deploy of Charm in MAAS fails because dbus fails" [High,Triaged]

 16:11 <rbasak> Yes

 16:11 <arosales> good one to track

 16:12 <arosales> jamespage, which team to we add to get in on the bug tracking list?

 16:13 <arosales> ~ubuntu-server ?

 16:13 <arosales> smoser, ^

 16:14 <jamespage> no - dbus should not be on the server list

 16:14 <jamespage> raise a task for juju-core - I think that will do it

 16:14 <smoser> there is a task for juju-core thre.

 16:14 <arosales> juju-core has a task

 16:15 <arosales> while we work on that is there any other bugs we want to cover?

 16:15 <jamespage> juju-core in Ubuntu

 16:15 <arosales> there are a few other mediums and lows

 16:15 <jamespage> not upstream

 16:15 <rbasak> I think you might need a packaging task against a package that ~ubuntu-server subscribes to that also has a Trusty task.

 16:15 <rbasak> I'm not sure this is a good way to do it, mind.

 16:15 <arosales> jamespage, ah ok

 16:16 <jamespage> rbasak, is the bug in dbus?

 16:16 <rbasak> Debatable. I'd say the primary bug is in juju-core.

 16:16 <rbasak> (or perhaps the MAAS provider in juju if that's separate)

 16:16 <arosales> rbasak, could you add a task for juju-core in Ubuntu?

 16:16 <rbasak> dbus would ideally not fail, and ideally log a message explaining what happens when it does.

 16:17 <rbasak> But juju should not try to restart networking. It doesn't need to do that anyway.

 16:17 <jamespage> rbasak, raise a distro bug task for Ubuntu and target to trusty

 16:17 <jamespage> so we can track it

 16:17 <rbasak> ack

 16:17 <arosales> rbasak, thanks

 16:18 <arosales> any other bugs we should cover

 16:18 <rbasak> Done. Importance?

 16:18 <arosales> got the highs and critical ones done @ http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:18 <rbasak> I'll say Triaged/High.

 16:18 <arosales> rbasak, thanks for brining in one we needed to track too

 16:18 <arosales> ok we covered those

 16:18 <arosales> not the others on the list are openstack

 16:19 <arosales> less websockify

 16:19 <arosales> moving on

 16:19 <arosales> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:19 <arosales> jamespage, to my failing did you create a topic bp?

 16:19 <jamespage> yes

 16:19 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html
