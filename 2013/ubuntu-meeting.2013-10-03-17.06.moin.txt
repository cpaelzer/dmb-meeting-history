 17:07 <pleia2> o/

 17:07 <czajkowski> aloha and welcome to this weeks community council catch up :)

 17:07 <sabdfl> o/

 17:07 <cprofitt> hello

 17:07 <sabdfl> nice to see you all again

 17:07 <pleia2> so we didn't send a reminder email to kubuntu folks, so I think they might not make it

 17:07 <czajkowski> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda

 17:07 <czajkowski> #topic Kubuntu catch up

 17:08 <czajkowski> anyone from Kubuntu around

 17:08 <czajkowski> ScottK: Riddell ping?

 17:09 <sabdfl> nice to see the 10k taiwanese school deployment of kubuntu derivative ezgo recently

 17:10 <cprofitt> +1

 17:10 <pleia2> cool, I hadn't seen that

 17:10 <pleia2> http://dot.kde.org/2013/10/02/ezgo-free-and-open-source-software-taiwans-schools

 17:10 <czajkowski> impressive

 17:10 <sabdfl> yes, even aseigo was pleased ;)

 17:12 <sabdfl> shall we invite AOB in the interim, and wrap at :30 if we have no response from #kubuntu?

 17:12 <pleia2> #topic Any other business

 17:12 * elfy is hanging about waiting for AOB :)

 17:12 <pleia2> http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/governance has been updated for accuracy \o/

 17:12 <sabdfl> go ahead elfy

 17:13 <elfy> can we get some help with a couple of RT's - one of which I think I cc'd CC yesterday

 17:13 <elfy> https://rt.ubuntu.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=22858

 17:13 <elfy> https://rt.ubuntu.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=22990

 17:13 <sabdfl> yes, saw the CC

 17:13 <cprofitt> elfy: I believe czajkowski already pinged someone on them

 17:13 <elfy> one of the ones I cc'd I've seen movement on

 17:14 <elfy> cprofitt: that'll be why then :)

 17:14 <elfy> the remember me one is the real pain for people

 17:14 <elfy> I think what really upsets us is we never get any response till we start pushing via you

 17:15 * cprofitt nods

 17:15 <elfy> though I will say when we had a few of them in our irc channel - they were great to work with

 17:15 <elfy> czajkowski - thanks for doing that :)

 17:15 <pleia2> elfy: it's not just you, IS seems to have quite the backlog

 17:15 <cprofitt> I think it is a metter of building a good relationship with them... which it sounds like you are via the irc

 17:15 <pleia2> so it takes nudges to prioritize

 17:15 <elfy> yep I understand there are 60 minutes in an hour :D

 17:16 <pleia2> and I think the forums stuff is genuinely hard :)

 17:16 <elfy> pleia2: I don't doubt it

 17:16 <elfy> but as I said in the mail - elmo and I were discussing trying to get external help

 17:17 <elfy> then that's as far as it went ;)

 17:17 * pleia2 nods

 17:17 <elfy> I'm sure that if there are people around who can help they will

 17:17 <czajkowski> elfy: elmo is but one member of the IS team and does tend to be the firzt one pinged when in fact it may fall to someone else to fix

 17:17 <pleia2> if they are interested in open sourcing their sysadmin operation I can offer some pointers ;)

 17:17 <elfy> but mostly it's about communication - #can-sys isn't really somewhere to go chat with people

 17:17 <czajkowski> so it's always the best point of contact either

 17:17 <czajkowski> I'm glad it's getting fixed

 17:18 <sabdfl> word from IS is:

 17:18 <sabdfl> sabdfl: we're currently looking at Ubuntu RT #22950 for the forums folks

 17:18 <sabdfl> sabdfl: because we were told that was the priority; I'll make sure 22858 and 22990 are up next

 17:18 <elfy> czajkowski: I understand he's not the only one - but he was the one talking to me :)

 17:18 <elfy> sabdfl: ok - thanks - can we make sure that the next one they look at for us is the 22858 one then please

 17:19 <sabdfl> ok

 17:19 <elfy> thanks

 17:19 <elfy> that's the one we catch most flak for at the moment

 17:20 <sabdfl> ok, ack'd in that sequence

 17:20 <sabdfl> that team tends to flatline around release

 17:20 <sabdfl> but at least the sequence is agreed

 17:20 <sabdfl> that a wrap elfy?

 17:20 <sabdfl> AOB?

 17:20 <elfy> yep

 17:20 <pleia2> just so the community is kept updated - we're wrapping up the LoCo Council appointment process in the CC, so we should have news soon :)

 17:20 <elfy> thanks all

 17:21 <pleia2> and speaking of appointments, we're still looking for nominees to be on the CC itself: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/community-announce/2013-September/000013.html

 17:21 <sabdfl> and the TB, iirc

 17:21 <pleia2> so if you're great, or know of someone who is great, apply

 17:21 <pleia2> has the TB sent out their call for nominees yet?

 17:22 <pleia2> doesn't look like it, I'll make sure it makes it to planet when they do

 17:25 <pleia2> that's all I have AOB-wise

 17:25 <sabdfl> doesn't look like we'll get Kubuntu feedback this week

 17:25 <sabdfl> i'm going to step afk in prep for a call - good to see you all again

 17:26 <cprofitt> thanks sabdfl

 17:26 <pleia2> nice to see you, sabdfl :)

 17:26 <pleia2> we've chatted with kubuntu folks throughout the cycle, so I don't know that there is anything pressing there, and they know where to find us :)

 17:26 <cprofitt> +1

 17:26 <sabdfl-afk> (oh and here's to an excellent 13.10 in two weeks - am enjoying the phone and saucy desktop too, hope our various flavours are feeling good about the home straight)

 17:26 <pleia2> cheer

 17:27 <pleia2> :)

 17:28 <pleia2> ok, I think we can wrap this up then

 17:28 <pleia2> thanks everyone
