 22:00 <PabloRubianes> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for November 7, 2013.

 22:00 <PabloRubianes> The wiki page for the Review Board is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

 22:01 <PabloRubianes> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:01 <PabloRubianes> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:01 <PabloRubianes> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:01 <PabloRubianes> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:01 <PabloRubianes> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:04 <DanChapman> Well my name is Daniel Chapman I live in the UK and am currently studying CS at university. I've been using Ubuntu since 10.10 and have been getting involved in the community for the last 6-7 months

 22:04 <DanChapman> the link for my wiki page is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/dpniel and my launchpad page is launchpad.net/~dpniel

 22:05 <IdleOne> DanChapman: Your main focus has been on the QA team, are there any other parts of the Ubuntusphere you contribute in?

 22:07 <DanChapman> IdleOne, so far not really, I've spent most of my time writing tests for ubiquity, I plan to spread my contributions across the Ubuntusphere as time progresses, but my main focus atm is to get quality tests for ubiquity across all flavors :-)

 22:07 <IdleOne> Important work for sure.

 22:08 <hggdh> DanChapman: I see you proposed a humongous marge on ubiquity ;-)

 22:08 <xnox> I'd like to second DanChapman for Ubuntu Membership.

 22:08 <DanChapman> hggdh, It's still growing ;-p

 22:08 * xnox would have thought DanChapman would be applying via Developer Membership Board as a contributing member =)
