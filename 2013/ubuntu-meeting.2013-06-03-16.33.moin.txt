 16:33 * mdeslaur slaps ubotty

 16:34 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'll go first

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'll be testing the zillion X updates this week

 16:34 <mdeslaur> and that's about it

 16:34 <mdeslaur> I'm on community too

 16:34 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 16:34 <sbeattie> I'm focusing on apparmor stuff again this week

 16:35 <sbeattie> Specifically https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-s-appisolation-sdk

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'm currently hacking on the aa-easyprof bits

 16:35 <sbeattie> that's pretty much it for me.

 16:35 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:35 <tyhicks> I'm working on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-s-appisolation-dbus

 16:36 <tyhicks> This week, I plan on having all of the work items done except for the items related to pushing everything to the archive

 16:36 <tyhicks> There's also some minor cleanup and finishing touch type stuff that I'll end up doing to the dbus and apparmor patches

 16:36 <tyhicks> That's it for me

 16:36 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:37 <jjohansen> I'm focused on apparmor stuff as well

 16:38 <jjohansen> I'm still poking around for the correct bp so I'll just skip pasting that and say, its the continuation of the ipc work

 16:38 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: I have "signals and bits for IPC" and "extended conditionals" in last weeks meeting log

 16:38 <mdeslaur> jjohansen: is it a continuation of that?

 16:39 <jjohansen> mdeslaur: yep

 16:39 <mdeslaur> cool

 16:40 <jjohansen> that and I'll get the latest patchset out for more review

 16:40 <jjohansen> sarnold: your up

 16:40 <sarnold> I'm on triage on this week

 16:40 <sarnold> I'll also be poking at trying to unbreak the boucycastle test suite, or steal portions of it, for QRT

 16:41 <mdeslaur> sarnold: what's the status of your openssl updates?

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm not sure why I've been met with such failure trying to use the test suite, but I presume it's partly my fault for not 100% grokking modern java

 16:42 <sarnold> mdeslaur: at least saucy will need re-doing, I think there's a new version pushed into the archive in the meantime; I also need to ask your help in preparing updates for security-proposed or something to get testers first..

 16:42 <sarnold> .. at least, I think I'd really rather have feedback from users before pushing it to everyone

 16:42 <sarnold> granted, fedora's been using it for a few months, but perhaps their knowledge of hwat broke isn't logged in their bug report. :)

 16:42 <mdeslaur> sarnold: is it in the PPA yet?

 16:42 <sarnold> mdeslaur: no

 16:43 <mdeslaur> sarnold: ok, please create a tracking bug, and make sure the bug # is in the changelog before uploading

 16:43 <sarnold> mdeslaur: okay

 16:43 <mdeslaur> sarnold: so people know where to go if there's an issue in -proposed

 16:43 <sarnold> mdeslaur: do I then just upload to the usual ppa once that's done?

 16:44 <mdeslaur> sarnold: yes, as -security, and then we'll get an AA to pocket-copy it to -proposed

 16:44 <mdeslaur> (perhaps I can already do that, need to check)

 16:44 <sarnold> mdeslaur: cool, thanks :)

 16:44 <mdeslaur> sarnold: you done?

 16:45 <sarnold> mdeslaur: how much time do you think I should spend on trying to revive the bouncy castle tests before writing a handful of much less comprehensive tests myself?

 16:45 <mdeslaur> sarnold: half a day?

 16:45 * mdeslaur shrugs

 16:45 <sarnold> mdeslaur: cool, thanks. now done :)

 16:45 <sarnold> chrisccoulson: you're up :)

 16:46 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: dude, wake up

 16:46 <sbeattie> mdeslaur: he's gotta finish his beer first.

 16:47 <mdeslaur> ok, I'll mark down "web-y browser thingies"

 16:48 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:48 <mdeslaur> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:48 <mdeslaur> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> oops, sorry, was just finishing up dinner ;)

 16:48 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: hrm, sorry about the meeting being so late for you

 16:48 <chrisccoulson> that's ok

 16:49 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: maybe we should get you to go first next time

 16:49 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: what are you working on this week?

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> this week, i'm still working on client-1303-webkit-maintenance. i've been fleshing out architecture diagrams for the last few days. hopefully they'll be in a good enough state for me to make public on google docs this week

 16:50 <mdeslaur> cool

 16:50 <chrisccoulson> and then we'll have a good idea of what work needs to happen :)

 16:51 <mdeslaur> awesome

 16:51 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: done?

 16:52 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, yeah. there aren't any updates planned this week :)

 16:52 <mdeslaur> oh, good

 16:52 <mdeslaur> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 16:52 <mdeslaur> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:53 <mdeslaur> Thanks everyone!
