 16:11 <rbasak> Can we drop this from tracking in Saucy maybe?

 16:12 <rbasak> doko: I noticed you commented on bug 1162139 earlier. I had thought "pending" meant that Clint would upload to Debian soon.

 16:13 * rbasak assigns himself

 16:13 <doko> rbasak, just asking because gcc-4.4 ftbfs now, and I don't have any interest to fix that

 16:13 <rbasak> doko: server team. You're in the right place for that bug :)

 16:14 <doko> ohh, good =)
