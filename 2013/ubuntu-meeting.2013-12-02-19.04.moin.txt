 19:04 <micahg-work> Welcome to the DMB meeting

 19:04 <ScottK> I pinged barry on #u-devel.

 19:04 * barry waves

 19:05 <micahg-work> #topic Review of previous action items

 19:05 <Laney> the agenda is false?

 19:05 <micahg-work> yes

 19:05 <micahg-work> well

 19:05 <Laney> oh, the top says micahg-work and the bottom says ScottK

 19:06 <ScottK> Since micahg-work already started, he wins.

 19:06 <micahg-work> we skipped the last meeting due to no agenda

 19:06 <micahg-work> so, I thought it was my turn...

 19:06 <ScottK> Go for it.

 19:07 <barry> take it away, eric the orchestra leader

 19:07 <micahg-work> #subtopic micahg to restructure PPU teams.

 19:07 <micahg-work> carried

 19:07 <micahg-work> #topic Per Package Uploader Applications

 19:08 <micahg-work> #subtopic PPU for Timo Jyrinki

 19:08 <micahg-work> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimoJyrinki/DeveloperApplication-PPU

 19:08 <micahg-work> Mirv, care to introduce yourself?

 19:09 <Mirv> sure. it reads better on the wiki page, but a Debian Developer and Ubuntu Member currently working in integrating some of the Ubuntu Touch packages and also working on Qt 5 packaging

 19:09 <Mirv> ie. part of the 'landing team' who orchestrate what pieces of Touch land next to the archives

 19:10 <Mirv> and I added a sorted version of the package list today to the page, in case the Qt 5 package set would be wanted to be defined separately for other people after me

 19:11 <ScottK> I think it would be useful to discuss the application in terms of Qt5 and other stuff as I think they present different challenges.

 19:13 <Mirv> for the 'Other packages', all but qtcreator are part of the canonicalupstream2distro system, where I currently have privilege to have a new version copied to archives, but I currently need an 'ack' from core dev if there are any packaging changes

 19:13 <Mirv> which is the same deal as for the other non-coredevs on the team

 19:13 <ScottK> Qt Creator is a bit of a special case on it's own.

 19:15 <barry> Mirv: so, are you suggesting two package sets, with qtcreator* as separate?

 19:16 <barry> i.e. qtcreator* not in a package set

 19:16 <Mirv> barry: I wasn't sure how you prefer defining package sets vs. just listing a big list per developer. in the longer term it would make sense to have two package sets defined, one for Qt 5 and one for cu2d.

 19:16 <Mirv> and leave qtcreator out of those both sets

 19:17 <Mirv> since robru and sil2100 may be interested in the cu2d ones later, and mitya57 in the Qt 5 set

 19:17 <Laney> I was thinking about the idea of a cu2d set

 19:17 <Laney> Not sure what others would have to say about that

 19:18 <micahg-work> are they related in any way other than that they're in cu2d?

 19:18 <Laney> They impose consistent packaging

 19:18 <barry> certainly seems like the qt5 pkgset makse sense

 19:18 <Mirv> micahg-work: not otherwise but that Canonical is upstream for all of them. there are several stacks and also more packages besides those I've listed initially.

 19:18 <ScottK> I think Qt Creator should not be in the Qt5 package set, but a separate PPU right.

 19:19 <Laney> None of our tools would work for assessing contributions to them though

 19:19 <Mirv> and yes, cu2d packages have consistent packaging via bzr split mode, so bzr bd always works and packaging is included inline

 19:19 <micahg-work> so, cu2d is like a MOTU equivalent for Canonical upstream packages?

 19:20 <micahg-work> * a cu2d packageset

 19:20 <micahg-work> hrm, let's table that for now

 19:20 <Laney> umm, I only expect it would be appropriate for people on the team that wrangles that stuff

 19:21 <Laney> ok

 19:21 <Laney> would be interesting for someone to come back to us with a proposal on it I guess

 19:21 <micahg-work> yes, that sounds like a good idea

 19:22 <micahg-work> #info Anyone interested in a packageset for cu2d packages should feel free to make a proposal to the DMB

 19:23 <micahg-work> Mirv, so, have you had any issues trying to push the qt stuff through Debian?

 19:24 <ScottK> Fortunately he knows someone on the Debian FTP team so Qt5 stuff seems to make it through New pretty quickly.

 19:24 <Mirv> micahg-work: mostly it has worked fine so that I've eg. given basis of some module packaging, they've tweaked it further and I've synced back. they've obviously rejected some stuff they don't want, like we have a policy breaking qtbase multi-arch thing that was added part of the arm64 work.

 19:24 <micahg-work> that's always nice :)

 19:25 <ScottK> There's also issues with Canonical using private headers that Debian chooses not to expose.

 19:25 <Mirv> I just got people stop to use qtsensors-private so that can be again synced for Debian

 19:26 <ScottK> Excellent.

 19:26 <Mirv> qtbase and qtdeclarative private headers are going to stay in Debian too

 19:26 <ScottK> That's the kind of progress I like to hear about.

 19:26 <ScottK> (for the others - Debian is only packaging private headers needed to build other Qt5 modules).

 19:26 <stgraber> Mirv: are you subscribed to ubuntu-devel-announce?

 19:27 <ScottK> Also on the Ubuntu side, the packaging is maintained with the Kubuntu team in bzr branches in the Kubuntu namespaces using our normal processes.

 19:27 <micahg-work> that's good to hear as well

 19:27 <ScottK> AFAICT, Ubuntu - Kubuntu stuff is all good at the moment.

 19:29 <Laney> Cool, that all sounds nice

 19:29 <Mirv> stgraber: I should be, but I'm just subscribing my canonica address too since I think they might be filtered to a folder on my private e-mail

 19:30 <ScottK> Mirv: You said the Ubuntu SDK stuff is being split out of the Qt Creator source?

 19:30 <Laney> How did you choose which 'other' packages to list?

 19:31 <ScottK> When will that be done and where does it go?

 19:31 <Mirv> ScottK: yes, it's split now, qtcreator has no Ubuntu bits and the qtcreator-plugin-ubuntu source package uses qtcreator-dev that was crafted to the former

 19:31 <ScottK> Excellent.

 19:31 <Mirv> Laney: I went through the cu2d stacks and selected those I work often on (sdk stack like ui-toolkit) and those with Qt/QML modules

 19:32 <Laney> OK, and you say you got some Qt stuff in sync but https://launchpad.net/~timo-jyrinki/+synchronised-packages doesn't appear to list that

 19:32 <Laney> has it not happened yet?

 19:33 <Laney> (or did someone else do the actual syncing?)

 19:34 <Mirv> Laney: like synced from Debian as is? any *opensource-src packages that don't have ubuntu version number ar such.

 19:34 <Mirv> I've not requested any syncs as such, and used the word 'sync' also in the sense that I've synced the ~kubuntu-packagers branches to be identical or near identical to Debian packaging. I still need something to build the PPA packages from.

 19:34 <ScottK> I can vouch for the fact that a lot of work by Mirv and mitya57 has been done to sync or minimize differences.

 19:35 <ScottK> Also some of the work will need to wait for Qt5 5.2 to land.

 19:35 <ScottK> (nothing to do with packaging - some of the Canonical upstream stuff had regressions with 5.1)

 19:36 <Laney> ok then, thanks, was looking for things being uploaded to Debian & then synced

 19:36 <Laney> guess that will happen with time

 19:36 * Laney is done

 19:38 <stgraber> Mirv: some of the packages you're applying for upload rights for are seeded, how can you tell which image they are likely to impact and when to refrain from uploading?

 19:41 <Mirv> stgraber: well I think those are seeded in the touch images, and currently we're in full manual mode so the landing team meetings decide when to allow uploads or not. we also run tests on each package manually before upload (copy), and in case of some not listed like indicators the cu2d runs desktop tests always.

 19:41 <stgraber> that's not answering my question ;)

 19:42 <stgraber> soon enough some of those packages will be in images other than touch (if they aren't already), we have a tool that can let you know which, what is it?

 19:43 <Mirv> ah.. I've really only looked at lp:~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds branches when needed, rmadison I think does not list seed information

 19:43 <stgraber> correct, rmadison doesn't and ubuntu-seeds is a pain to parse if you're called germinate

 19:43 <stgraber> we have a tool called seeded-in-ubuntu for that

 19:43 <Mirv> nice, making a note

 19:45 <stgraber> in general we try to use proposed-migration blocks around milestones to prevent accidental changes to the images, it's however always a good idea to think twice when uploading around those times and use seeded-in-ubuntu to make sure your change won't affect one of the products that's about to release

 19:45 <micahg-work> While we've reduced the amount of time and packages that are frozen, cedrtain uploads freezes can still impact others, so it's good to check during those periods and be aware

 19:45 <micahg-work> *certain uploads during freezes

 19:45 <Laney> Even proposed blocks get annoying if you want to put a bugfix in and there's already an upload

 19:45 * Mirv continues writing notes

 19:46 <micahg-work> indeed

 19:46 <Laney> What happens with "allowing uploads" when Kubuntu wants to do a change?

 19:47 <Laney> Not strictly related to this application, I understand. ;-)

 19:48 <Mirv> and we already have this situation that was observed that xubuntu started including ubuntu-system-settings (not sure how intentionally) which pulls eg. ubuntu-ui-toolkit

 19:48 <Laney> well, they didn't want to make a change to it

 19:48 <Laney> I mean if there's some patch to cherry-pick or whatever

 19:49 * micahg-work wonders why Xubuntu did that (with his xubuntu-dev hat on), guessing it was pulled in by something else

 19:49 <Laney> some alternate recommends following thing

 19:49 <Laney> from an indicator IIRC

 19:50 <stgraber> micahg-work: yeah, we had a time where a bunch of indicators would recommend some packages in the wrong order which indirectly included ubuntu-system-settings

 19:50 <micahg-work> Xubuntu isn't pulling it in at the moment according to seeded-in-ubunut

 19:50 <stgraber> micahg-work: I had them fix those recommends and I believe it did the trick for most images, not sure if something was missing for xubuntu though

 19:50 <micahg-work> yeah, I hope to audit the Xubuntu seed sometime soon for stuff like that

 19:50 <Mirv> Laney: for this cycle Kubuntu is not going to have much interest yet in Qt 5, but that will definitely change in the next one. Qt uploads should probably be co-operated/acked, a discussion that should continue in the next UDS.

 19:51 <ScottK> Mirv: We do plan to start packaging KF5 modules this cycle, so we do need to be coordinated.

 19:52 <Mirv> ScottK: ok.

 19:52 <Laney> OK, can discuss that outside of the meeting

 20:07 <micahg-work> that's not quite right, motion not carried

 20:07 <Laney> I think you guys should work on a proposal for granting cu2d upload rights

 20:07 <Mirv> okay

 20:07 <Laney> we'll be quite happy to consider it

 20:07 <micahg-work> #info Vote on PPU for other packages did not pass (requires +4)

 20:08 <micahg-work> yes, please

 20:08 <Mirv> it's not very well formed indeed, especially since cu2d in itself is not that familiar to most. the idea is to reduce the need to get the 'acks'.

 20:08 <Mirv> I'll chat with didrocks

 20:10 <micahg-work> #topic any other business

 20:10 <micahg-work> we're already 10 minutes over, so anything else to discuss?

 20:10 <Mirv> (if you'll excuse me, I've pressure applied that I need to get to sleep)

 20:10 <barry> just thinking it would probably be best to skip the dec 30 meeting, but we can take that to email

 20:10 <micahg-work> Mirv, thanks, and congratulations

 20:11 <Mirv> thanks all, see you again with the cu2d at some point

 20:11 <tumbleweed> there's re-election, but that's still a way off

 20:11 <tumbleweed> just reminding people

 20:13 <Laney> oh yeah, that's interesting

 20:14 <Laney> can do the call first half of january though, so still a way off
