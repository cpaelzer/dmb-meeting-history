 15:10 <stgraber> oops, one sec

 15:10 <stgraber> Blueprint-related work:

 15:10 <stgraber> - Image based updates (BLUEPRINT: foundations-1305-image-based-updates)

 15:10 <stgraber> - Updated the specification on the wiki

 15:10 <stgraber> - Added phased-percentage support on the server side

 15:10 <stgraber> - Extended test coverage (still need tests covering the file generators)

 15:10 <stgraber> - Prioritized the work for the system-image clien in 13.10

 15:10 <stgraber> - Implemented the boot time hooks for touch (somewhere in the landing queue)

 15:10 <stgraber> - LXC

 15:10 <stgraber> - Moved all the bugs from sourceforge to github (well, fixed most of them rather than move them)

 15:10 <stgraber> - Code reviews

 15:10 <stgraber> - Some discussions with Google on cgroup management

 15:10 <stgraber> - Rewrote lxc-info to use the LXC API and show IP addresses by default.

 15:10 <stgraber> - Updated all the API based tools to check the user has control access over the container instead of failing in mysterious ways.

 15:10 <stgraber> 

 15:10 <stgraber> Other work:

 15:11 <stgraber> - Other

 15:11 <stgraber> - Quite a lot of queue reviews

 15:11 <stgraber> - Implemented a script to auto-accept unseeded packages into the archive

 15:11 <stgraber> 

 15:11 <stgraber> TODO (hopefully this week):

 15:11 <stgraber> - Get to 100% code coverage in the system-image server side tests

 15:11 <stgraber> - Write a slightly more user friendly tool to release an image from saucy-proposed to saucy

 15:11 <stgraber> - Spend some more time debugging the filesystem unmount sequence, fixing anything that needs fixing

 15:11 <stgraber> - LXC upstream work (some more bugs to move to github, website work, ...)

 15:11 <stgraber> (DONE)

 15:12 <xnox> ah.

 15:23 <ev> Short week. Was on holiday in ‘merica until Monday.

 15:23 <ev> Lots of time spent getting caught up after three weeks away.

 15:23 <ev> Mostly still helping Alex bootstrap the CI team.

 15:23 <ev> Got up to speed on the Cassandra failures. We had a massive Ceph outage which knocked over Cassandra, which obviously knocked over Daisy. Reports resend every two hours, so I don’t believe we missed out on anything, but I’m still waiting on access to the production database to confirm these sorts of things:

 15:23 <ev> https://rt.admin.canonical.com//Ticket/Display.html?id=63860

 15:23 <ev> We are *way* behind on the existing retracer architectures and we still don’t have an armhf retracer for Touch. There appears to have been some work done on this while I was away, but it looks like they dropped it again. I tried following up in #webops, but we are without a vanguard. I’ll touch base with James or Tom later.

 15:23 <ev> https://rt.admin.canonical.com//Ticket/Display.html?id=58019

 15:23 <ev> In anticipation of webops requesting it, I’m migrating the error tracker deployment over to juju-deployer.

 15:23 <ev> TODO:

 15:23 <ev> I need to find a replacement for gnetworkmonitor, as it waking up frequently on busy networks continues to piss people off:

 15:23 <ev> https://bugs.launchpad.net/whoopsie/+bug/991481

 15:23 <ev> I now have enough details from Acunu to finish implementing the improvements to the average errors per calendar day calculation.

 15:23 <ev> (done)

 15:23 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 991481 in Whoopsie "Constant dns traffic for daisy.ubuntu.com" [High,Confirmed]

 15:24 <ev> https://wiki.canonical.com/IncidentReports/2013-09-30-Ceph-Rebalance-Outage is the Ceph outage

 15:25 <stgraber> ev: bah, it's only causing around 20% of the requests to my DNS servers ;)

 15:25 <ev> hah

 15:25 <stgraber> 1 request every 15s per machine on the network and I apparently have a lot of those ;)

 15:25 <cjwatson> stgraber: And your own substation?

 15:26 <xnox> ev: anti-social =)

 15:26 <slangasek> ev: retracers> thanks - I think we need to get this sorted out ASAP, it's alarming that we have no errors data at all about the phone at this stage.

 15:26 <ev> slangasek: I couldn't agree more. Any help leaning on them would be greatly appreciated

 15:27 * slangasek nods

 15:27 <xnox> ev: what events do you actually want from gnetworkmonitor? you can have whoopsie e.g. start on net-device-up, then each time a connection is established, you can retry uploading reports.

 15:27 <stgraber> cjwatson: ;) I do occasionaly run LXC load testing with around a thousand container on the same machine, all running whoppsie, then those DNS queries are pretty much the only thing I see going through the network ;)

 15:27 <ev> Or telling the other Ubuntu Engineering teams to stop taking up all of webops' time

 15:27 <slangasek> ev: I would've yelled at last week's sync call about this had I realize it still hadn't moved :/

 15:27 <cjwatson> ev: *cough*

 15:28 <ev> xnox: from memory, I'm using gnetworkmonitor to know when we're really connected

 15:28 <ev> in my testing CONNECTED_ALL or whatever the NetworkManager state was didn't convey that

 15:28 <cjwatson> ev: Hopefully I've finished getting launchpad-buildd upgraded on things for, oh, at least a few weks

 15:28 <cjwatson> *weeks

 15:28 <cjwatson> (dear GOD is that process painfully manual)

 15:28 <slangasek> * helped with getting final beta out last week

 15:28 <slangasek> * discussions about how to do freeze management for phone packages so that we're not putting up additional roadblocks to phone development for 13.10

 15:28 <slangasek> * worked with Barry on testing system-image / ubuntu-download-manager so this could land in the phone images \o/

 15:28 <slangasek> * fighting with my network, which has decided to stop passing dhcp requests reliably following a power outage over the weekend

 15:28 <slangasek> * picked at the edges of the proposed-migration queue (insighttoolkit4)

 15:28 <slangasek> * followed through on SRUs for shim update in 12.04.4

 15:28 <slangasek> * got /etc/adjtime out of our live images, since it's not used in Ubuntu and just causes confusion

 15:28 <slangasek> (done)

 15:29 <bdmurray> bug triage of update-manager, ubuntu-release-upgrader, ubiquity bugs

 15:29 <bdmurray> recreated update-manager bug 1202754

 15:29 <bdmurray> reviewed and merged apt-check (update-notifier) merge proposal speeding it up

 15:29 <ubottu> bug 1202754 in update-manager (Ubuntu Saucy) "update-manager crashed with SystemExit in exit(): 0" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1202754

 15:29 <bdmurray> worked on click chroot code

 15:29 <xnox> ev: should we refactor start.ubuntu.com/network-connectivity check from ubiquity?! =) yeah, supporting states in upstart would help here, as upon network check we could run a quick check against start.ubuntu.com and emit the state of "connected"

 15:29 <bdmurray> worked on ubuntu-release-upgrader not needing gksu

 15:29 <bdmurray> uploaded procps bug fix for bug 1150413

 15:29 <xnox> for those jobs that care about htat.

 15:30 <ev> xnox: yes - networkmanager has support for something like this, but the tin foil hat crowd nixed it the last time matthieu brought it up

 15:30 <ev> if memory serves

 15:30 <slangasek> xnox: we could reimplement everything in Qt and use its network checking apis, I hear those work a treat

 15:30 <slangasek> (by which I mean, bug #1233435)

 15:30 <ev> xnox: what I'd really like is an API that I could register an address with. "Let me know when we're connected and you get this response from this URL"

 15:30 <stokachu> note: 1211876 is a high visibility bug going to mark it as high

 15:34 <stokachu> bdmurray: thanks man

 15:35 <slangasek> stokachu: bug #995719, you say there should be no regression.  So it's not possible that something will be relying on this behavior?

 15:36 <stokachu> slangasek: nothing should be calling it directly, think of it more like a background job keeping up the process names

 15:36 <stgraber> slangasek: yep, can do

 15:36 <slangasek> stokachu: so nothing can be relying on those process name changes?

 15:36 <stokachu> slangasek: nothing in puppet does, no

 15:37 <slangasek> well, but what about things outside of puppet?

 15:37 <slangasek> these are the questions we ask for SRUs :)

 15:37 <stokachu> its not an external api so nothing would be calling it directly

 15:38 <slangasek> but something external to puppet could be relying on the process name updates

 15:38 <stokachu> everyone ive interacted with either manually deletes this or has a puppet config that ensures that file doesn't exist

 15:38 <stokachu> even IS does it

 15:38 <stgraber> sto they all look good to me, will upload those 3 in a minute

 15:39 <stgraber> stokachu: ^

 15:39 <stokachu> stgraber: thanks man

 15:39 <slangasek> stokachu: that doesn't mean that /everyone/ does it, just the people who are smart enough to be in your friends list :)  we have to consider the SRU implications for those not following best practices, too

 15:39 <stokachu> slangasek: yea im trying to think of what kind of use case would do this

 15:40 <stokachu> slangasek: to help me pinpoint where there might be a problem

 15:40 <slangasek> anyway, we can follow up on that out of band

 15:40 <stokachu> do we have any puppet experts here?

 15:40 <stokachu> ok

 15:40 <slangasek> I'd try the server team for puppet expertise

 15:41 <stokachu> ok ill ask around and see

 15:41 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 15:41 <slangasek> any other topics?

 15:41 <stgraber> stokachu: all uploaded

 15:42 <stokachu> stgraber: thanks again

 15:43 <stokachu> stgraber: want me to unassign sponsors now?
