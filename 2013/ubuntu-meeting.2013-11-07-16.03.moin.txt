 16:10 <xnox> in)

 16:10 <xnox> (DONE)

 16:11 <cjwatson> Canonical client planning sprint.

 16:11 <cjwatson> Merged Brian's chroot management support into lp:click and got it working well enough for a sprint demo (which was well-received).  Generally updated people outside Foundations on our plan for cross-building/emulation for app testing.

 16:11 <cjwatson> Merged ben from unstable and ported transition tracker to new version in trusty, gaining us Depends: foo:any support, better level calculation, and a better index.

 16:11 <cjwatson> Working on FusionIO disk detection in GRUB (bug 1237519).

 16:11 <ubottu> bug 1237519 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "Grub2 fails to install to non-standard device path" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1237519

 16:11 <cjwatson> Some multiarch conversions to help with targeted cross-build situations.

 16:11 <cjwatson> LP adjustment to rely only on one other machine for running germinate rather than two (https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/launchpad/configurable-germinate-base/+merge/194340).

 16:11 <cjwatson> To do: finish FusionIO work, catch up on other GRUB OEM bugs, parallelise germinate across architectures in publisher, release new click version to trusty

 16:11 <cjwatson> ..

 16:11 <jodh> * upstart

 16:11 <jodh> - Reworked lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/bug-1238078 (now merged).

 16:11 <jodh> - Merged lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/bug-1235649

 16:11 <jodh> - Discussions with CI re Upstart DEP-8 testing.

 16:11 <jodh> - Wrote script to detect new Upstart jobs hitting the archive

 16:11 <cjwatson> oh, I also showed off the emulator in the sprint demo, albeit with a disclaimer about lack of graphics :-)

 16:11 <jodh> (with a view to reviewing jobs):

 16:12 <jodh> http://people.canonical.com/~jhunt/upstart/scripts/check_for_new_upstart_jobs.sh

 16:12 <jodh> Now, just need to find a way to automatically detect changes to

 16:12 <jodh> upstart jobs without having to parse trusty-changes. Ideas?

 16:12 <jodh> - Overcoming ptrace limitations: Fixed 2 bugs in preliminary branch.

 16:12 <jodh> Currently working adding additional ptrace tests to ensure expected behaviour.

 16:12 <jodh>  ù

 16:12 <barry> system-image: LP: #1217098.  system-image 2.0 testing (looking good - waiting on LP: #1215586 for u/i and landing slot).  nexus 10 installation and testing.

 16:12 <barry> vUDS: core-1311-python3-roadmap.  re-engaging with xapian upstream (lots of progress there recently).  started updating python3 porting plan for 14.04 (spreadsheets, wiki).  http://tinyurl.com/mtf9jrb

 16:12 <barry> other: LP: #1248417.  started looking at LP: #1165104.  python-coverage sponsorship in debian.  converted enum34 (0.9.19-1) to pybuild and updated LibraryStyleGuide for pybuild.  PEP 8 updates.  dmb meeting.

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1248417 in python3-defaults (Ubuntu) "Sync python3-defaults 3.3.2-17 (main) from Debian unstable (main)" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1248417

 16:12 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1165104 in oneconf (Ubuntu) "oneconf is only showing the pc you are on in raring and isn't sharing to other machines" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1165104

 16:13 <xnox> jodh: i thought we had deduplication running somewhere and possibly ability to fetch md5sums of files.

 16:14 <xnox> jodh: as it md5sums of all /etc/init/*

 16:14 <jodh> xnox: sounds great - just define somewhere! :)

 16:14 <xnox> jodh: conditional branch is out of range

 16:15 <slangasek> xnox: aha; the backtrace sergiusens first shared did look like it was pointing to a TLS problem, you've confirmed now and are making headway?  Is there anything I can do to help with that, or is the debugging env sufficiently arcane that I should just stay clear?

 16:15 <jodh> xnox: ?

 16:17 <xnox> slangasek: there is progress, needs recompiled bionic. I didn't try it yet myself. serge and rsalveti are on it.... they did tweak TLS slots before to make bionic work at all.

 16:17 <xnox> not bionic, for hybris to work.

 16:17 <slangasek> xnox: ahh, ok

 16:19 <slangasek> jodh: without parsing trusty-changes> grab Contents-i386.gz for the list of all packages containing jobs, and download Packages.gz to get the list of current versions; at interval of your choice, re-download the Contents and Packages; for each newly-introduced job file, or for each package version that's changed, download and compare

 16:20 <jodh> slangasek: ack - thanks!

 16:20 <cjwatson> note that Contents is only updated daily as it's pretty expensive to compute

 16:20 <slangasek> xnox: right, TLS for bionic + hybris is something special... the work they did there is actually quite scary ;)

 16:20 <jodh> cjwatson: ack

 16:21 <slangasek> xnox: hmm, I wonder if that work could actually be interfering with native thread support on the bionic side?  Since most of it *did* involve "neutering threads"

 16:21 <slangasek> * Client sprint last week, lots of discussions... won't try to give you a systematic update here, you'll certainly see the discussions reflected in the UDS sessions coming up in two weeks

 16:21 <slangasek> * good discussions about how to support go on the client, which we will see more of this cycle

 16:21 <slangasek> * dates set for the Ubuntu Core sprint, please get your travel approvals in :)

 16:22 <slangasek> * helped with upstart MP reviews, we finally have the queue under control (mostly due to xnox!) and will see a new upstream release soon

 16:22 <slangasek> * upstart discussions in Debian: the question of default init system has now gone to the Debian Technical Committee

 16:22 <slangasek> * was out sick Tuesday - too much travel is bad for the body

 16:22 <slangasek> * upcoming:

 16:22 <slangasek> * Monday is Veterans' Day

 16:22 <slangasek> * I'm up for jury duty on Tuesday (and possibly longer)

 16:22 <slangasek> * looking at the emulator, and possibly even helping

 16:25 <slangasek> any questions over the above?

 16:26 <slangasek> jodh: and nicely done, taking my ptrace branch off the floor and making it un-broken :)  Will be so nice to have that bug finally fixed

 16:26 <doko_> slangasek, did I miss any message about the sprint?

 16:26 <jodh> slangasek: thanks - most of the credit goes to you though :)

 16:26 <slangasek> doko_: what kind of message?  were you cc:ed on msm's mail?

 16:27 <cjwatson> 17025 N T Nov 05 Michelle Surtee        PLEASE READ: Ubuntu Core sprint - 27 - 31 Jan 2014 - London, Bluefin

 16:27 <cjwatson> (no comments on my lack of inbox zero please :-P)

 16:28 <xnox> slangasek: almost, there was broken commit on trunk. next set should be fine.

 16:28 <bdmurray> cjwatson: wow, that makes me feel better

 16:28 <doko_> slangasek, can't find it. forward would be appreciated

 16:28 <slangasek> xnox: whoops. whose commit was broken?

 16:29 <slangasek> doko_: does 'doko@canonical.com' reach you?

 16:29 <doko_> should

 16:29 <slangasek> doko_: forwarded

 16:31 <slangasek> jodh, xnox: does it actually make sense to do these upstart recipe builds across the set of releases we currently build for?  (raring,saucy,trusty?)

 16:31 <xnox> slangasek: integration issue. trunk & MPs passed everything, the combination of the two with new automake in trusty did not, however.

 16:31 <slangasek> ah

 16:31 <slangasek> ok, cool :)

 16:31 <slangasek> [TOPIC] AOB

 16:31 <xnox> slangasek: yes it does. I want to go back all the way to precise actually.

 16:31 <slangasek> anything else?

 16:32 <slangasek> now's a great time to discuss

 16:32 <slangasek> xnox: hmm.  I think we should build for precise, but not for raring

 16:32 <xnox> slangasek: ok.

 16:33 <xnox> slangasek: i'll check that it still works with quantal, then step down to precise, and then disable quantal & raring dailies.

 16:33 <slangasek> ok

 16:34 <cjwatson> are these recipe builds on devirt?

 16:35 <cjwatson> (either way, it's good to be economical with builder time, although the virt pool is worse off at the moment and probably will be until we get scalingstack)

 16:36 <xnox> cjwatson: well upstart is ~8minute build.

 16:36 <stgraber> we at least have one devirt PPA with builds, not sure if we still also have a virt one

 16:36 <cjwatson> xnox: sure, it does add up though

 16:36 <xnox> cjwatson: and armhf devirt has plenty of builders.

 16:36 <cjwatson> and it's easier to argue against builds that are genuinely abusive when we're more consistent :)

 16:37 <cjwatson> I agree it's not the worst problem by any means

 16:37 <xnox> ok.

 16:39 <slangasek> alrighty, guess we've exhausted our capacity for conversation today ;)
