 16:34 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:34 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:35 <jdstrand> I'm on community this week

 16:35 <jdstrand> I have some bug triage to finish up

 16:35 <jdstrand> I have pending updates I'm working on

 16:35 <jdstrand> I've also been bootstrapping appstore review scripts

 16:36 <jdstrand> I also hope to test/sponsor tyhick's pending apparmor/dbus upload

 16:36 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I'm in the happy place this week

 16:36 <mdeslaur> I start my holiday on wednesday, until the 3rd

 16:36 <mdeslaur> so I'll basically be upgrading my laptop to saucy today, and that's pretty much it

 16:37 <mdeslaur> and will possibly do some triage/research

 16:37 <mdeslaur> that's it for me, sbeattie

 16:37 <sbeattie> mdeslaur: enjoy your holiday

 16:37 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor this week

 16:38 <sbeattie> I'm focused on writing additional testcases for the regression tests, in particular IPC.

 16:38 <sbeattie> ... which is pretty much it for me.

 16:38 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 16:40 <sbeattie> oh wait, tyhicks is off today.

 16:40 <sbeattie> sarnold: I think you're up.

 16:41 <sarnold> I'm on triage this week, working on an embargoed update, and doing MIR audits

 16:43 <sarnold> I'm also playing with different published kernels to try to find one that does kvm / qemu / libvirt without any problems. some kernels run VMs fine but I'm having trouble creating VMs, which is a big necssary for the update I'm working on..

 16:43 <jdstrand> erf

 16:44 <sarnold> yeah. I kinda wish I had a precise machine around for this kind of stuff. :)

 16:44 <sarnold> oh well :) chrisccoulson, you're up :)

 16:44 <jdstrand> I don't see why a kernel would fail on creating a vm vs running it

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> hi :)

 16:44 <jdstrand> (well, unless running it causes problems, like 3.10 with vmvga)

 16:45 <sarnold> jdstrand: no, me neither, it might also be libvirt's fault.. :)

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> this week, i'm mostly working on a messaging API for oxide (to allow content scripts to pass messages to the application), so that i can finally start adding some proper tests

 16:45 <chrisccoulson> last week was quite a productive week :)

 16:46 <chrisccoulson> there's also a firefox 23.0.1 (which is already released actually). it's not a security driven update and from looking at the bug list, i'm not convinced it's worth spending time on to update

 16:47 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 16:49 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:49 <jdstrand> he Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:49 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.
