 22:02:13 <iulian> #startmeeting 2200 UTC Ubuntu Membership Board

 22:02:13 <meetingology> Meeting started Thu May  2 22:02:13 2013 UTC.  The chair is iulian. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.

 22:02:27 <iulian> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board for the 2200 UTC meeting for May 2, 2013.

 22:02:47 <iulian> We will attempt to get through all of the applicants that have added themselves to that list before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the entire list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

 22:02:57 <iulian> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

 22:03:11 <iulian> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page. After the introduction the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

 22:03:23 <iulian> During this time it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are most likely reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

 22:03:53 <iulian> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If the sum of those numbers is positive, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (feel free congratulate them!)

 22:16:03 <meetingology> Deadlock, casting vote may be used

 22:16:09 <IdleOne> sachy: You are doing great work and we want you to continue. Please don't be discouraged by this outcome.

 22:16:42 <sachy> ok, thank you

 22:16:51 <iulian> sachy: And please do come back!

 22:17:01 <iulian> Chauncellor: You're up next.

 22:17:01 <bkerensa> sachy:  Look forward to seeing you re-apply in six months!

 22:17:09 <Chauncellor> My name is Brett Cornwall. My wiki page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChauncellorUbuntuApplication. I started using Ubuntu in 7.04 and most of my contributions are mostly in bug work (and in previous years I maily gave support in IRC). I now work a lot on Compiz bug triaging/cleanup and go on AskUbuntu every so often to help with questions.

 22:17:24 <PabloRubianes> Me too sachy

 22:18:16 <Chauncellor> If Omer Akram is here I would be confident that he would endorse me

 22:18:43 <iulian> OK, thanks very much Chauncellor.

 22:18:55 <iulian> Any questions for Brett?

 22:19:24 <s-fox> Chauncellor:  you have a soulful history on ubuntu forums. can you please explain your infractions ?

 22:19:36 <s-fox> colourful

 22:19:49 <Chauncellor> Sure :)

 22:20:16 <Chauncellor> The first infraction was merely a playful code snippet that I was naive enough to publish - 'rm -rf'

 22:20:27 <Chauncellor> I used that to prove a point

 22:20:33 <IdleOne> you consider that "playful" ?

 22:20:37 <Chauncellor> ill-advised, of course

 22:20:49 <Chauncellor> it was meant as sarcasm, and not at all was a direction

 22:20:59 <Chauncellor> it was used as a poor example

 22:21:58 <Chauncellor> As for the second, I had a small squabble with a forum member on the ubuntu+1 development boards - I rose to his taunt, something I certainly should not have done

 22:22:18 <Chauncellor> if I do hit that rare occasion upon which I feel heated, I normally turn the monitor off and simmer for an hour before returning

 22:22:32 <Chauncellor> I am extremely unfortunate to have not done so at that point

 22:22:53 <Chauncellor> I do hope this can be looked past as a good deal of time has passed

 22:23:21 <Chauncellor> A regretful decision

 22:23:36 <IdleOne> How long ago was this?

 22:23:48 * s-fox is checking dates.

 22:23:49 <Chauncellor> A few years - 2010? I can go check

 22:24:34 <Chauncellor> I have a slow internet connection presently

 22:24:51 <IdleOne> s-fox: is looking it up

 22:25:01 <IdleOne> Anybody else have any questions while we wait?

 22:25:15 <s-fox> advising a member to remove /boot was may 19th 2010

 22:25:35 <lousygarua> AHHH I'M LATE SORRY

 22:25:39 <Chauncellor> I would like to once again claim that I did not advise any member to actually run that command

 22:25:42 <s-fox> using foul language towards a community member was july 20th 2010

 22:26:02 <iulian> Thanks for your comments, Chauncellor. We appreciate your honesty.

 22:26:05 <Chauncellor> I take full responsibility for both and have sent apologies

 22:26:15 <Chauncellor> We are on good terms now

 22:27:09 <iulian> IdleOne?

 22:27:13 <IdleOne> Chauncellor: you are aware that forum posts are public, the user it was directed at may not have run the command but who knows if some unsuspecting user could have. Our actions affect more than the person we are speaking to.

 22:27:45 <s-fox> Chauncellor:  contact ranch hand would be my advice.

 22:28:06 <IdleOne> I would encourage you to continue doing good work and come back at a future date, this won't be held against you forever.

 22:28:08 <hggdh> Chauncellor: this is the type of response that made us stop and -1 you...

 22:28:14 <iulian> lousygarua: Hello. Could you please introduce yourself?

 22:28:26 <lousygarua> hello

 22:28:32 <lousygarua> I'm Amir from Israel

 22:28:50 <lousygarua> Currently acting as the leader of the LoCo team, as no one else would take the lead

 22:29:28 <lousygarua> I've been Linuxing since 2006 and Ubuntuing since 2008. I've been an active member in the Israeli community for quite some time

 22:29:44 <lousygarua> helping in forums, drupaling on our websites, supporting on our IRC channel

 22:29:53 <IdleOne> lousygarua: could you link to your wiki page please

 22:30:12 <lousygarua> IdleOne, here, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AmirEldor

 22:30:28 <bkerensa> lousygarua: Is your LoCo been pretty active since you have led it? I'm trying to get a idea of how big your contribution is there

 22:31:14 <lousygarua> bkerensa, it's a small country, and we don't have many volunteers

 22:31:22 <iulian> lousygarua: When did you guys have the last LoCo meeting?

 22:32:18 <lousygarua> iulian, we don't have people to do effective LoCo meeting. We mainly communicate over the internet and coordinate tasks. Tomorrow I'm going to have some kind of 'LoCo' meeting with a guy who wants to help develop the loco

 22:32:50 <lousygarua> we will also advocate Ubuntu on an upcoming annucal Linux convention in August

 22:32:58 <IdleOne> loco meetings can be on irc, they don't have to be in person.

 22:33:06 <lousygarua> I do everything I can to keep the blood streaming throupgh our communities

 22:33:27 <lousygarua> When it's just one or two people, we prefer using the phone or our mailing list for decisions and discussions

 22:33:39 <lousygarua> Our LoCo is in bad shape

 22:33:54 <iulian> lousygarua: What are your future plans to fix that?

 22:34:19 <lousygarua> We plan to translate and contribute to the Ubuntu Advocacy Kit (by Jono Bacon if I'm not mistaken?)

 22:34:43 <lousygarua> continue support in our forums and site

 22:34:56 <lousygarua> we get a lot of hits from Windows users on our /download page

 22:34:57 <iulian> lousygarua: i see.

 22:35:03 <lousygarua> through analytics I've recently installed

 22:35:22 <lousygarua> with some effort and help we can help raise more awareness to FOSS in Israel

 22:35:53 <iulian> Any other questions?

 22:35:56 <lousygarua> Also, we need to make a better impression of Ubuntu Israel as well. Back on 2008 we had a bad LoCo lead which gave a bad impression on the Ubuntu LoCo to other LUGs

 22:36:01 <lousygarua> ok I will stop now :)

 22:40:06 <iulian> snwh: You're up next.

 22:40:12 <snwh> thanks

 22:40:14 <snwh> Well, my name is Sam Hewitt and I'm primarily an open-source designer. I've been using Ubuntu since 7.10 (if memory serves). In 2012, I helped found the open source development team: Freyja Development, where we work on projects for Ubuntu. The most familiar one being Unity Tweak Tool. Prior to that, I contributed to various smaller projects, where I could. Currently, I and the rest of the team are working on our next project; also,

 22:40:14 <snwh> I'm personally working on an open source icon and theme set. Wiki Page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/snwh

 22:40:16 <lousygarua> iulian, alright

 22:40:32 <iulian> lousygarua: Feel free to /query me if you have any questions or anything.

 22:40:41 <hggdh> lousygarua: we need 4 +1s to approve

 22:41:40 <snwh> I could throw in that I write for OMG Ubuntu I guess

 22:41:50 <bkerensa> snwh: that wont help here much ;)

 22:42:00 <snwh> bkerensa, worth a shot ;)

 22:42:04 <IdleOne> lol

 22:42:09 <IdleOne> that isn't true.

 22:42:17 <lousygarua> hggdh, It's ok, I see :)

 22:42:36 <IdleOne> our personal opinions of a website doesn't deminish the fact that you still do write about ubuntu

 22:42:52 <iulian> Any questions for snwh?

 22:42:58 <PabloRubianes> lousygarua: and if you need help with your loco you can ask to the lococouncil for ideas

 22:43:16 <snwh> I have personal opinions about the site as well :)

 22:44:48 <nik90> Hello everyone, I am Nekhelesh Ramananthan. My wiki page is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nekhelesh%20Ramananthan.

 22:44:53 <nik90> I have been using Ubuntu since 8.04. My first real inspirations to contribute started with quicklist support for applications in 12.04 and also the Muktware Ubuntu Manual 12.04. I then expanded to other areas like blogging, helping new users and coding for the Ubuntu Touch Clock app project.

 22:45:50 <nik90> I have been helped by Michael Hall, and now I am trying to return some of that back to the Ubuntu Community.

 22:46:13 <lousygarua> PabloRubianes, how should I message the council? By email or in an IRC channel?

 22:47:52 <IdleOne> lousygarua: email would be best
