 16:00 <smoser> welcome to this weeks' exciting adventure of the Ubuntu Server Team meeting.

 16:00 <jamespage> o/

 16:01 <smoser> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Meeting

 16:01 <smoser> that link above is for all who are playing along at home.

 16:01 <smoser> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <smoser> * gaughen file bug with status.u.c to get ubuntu server topic tracking in there (carry over)

 16:02 <smoser> gaughen, is that http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html ?

 16:02 <jamespage> we appear to still be missing quite a few bp's - I'm not sure whether its status of what

 16:02 <smoser> I think it is, so if no one objects i'm calling that one done. if someone does object, bother me later. moving on.

 16:03 <smoser> missing bps ?

 16:03 <smoser> oh, yeah, we do.

 16:03 <smoser> hm..

 16:03 <smoser> well, i'll carry that over then.

 16:04 <smoser> #ACTION gaughen or jamespage or smoser: get all server blueprints represented at /topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:04 * meetingology gaughen or jamespage or smoser: get all server blueprints represented at /topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:04 <smoser> * everyone look at grep-merges output and merge/sync as much and early as possible

 16:04 <smoser> if you've been doing the above, please continue. if you've not, please start looking atmerges.

 16:05 <smoser> merges are a good way to get started with ubuntu development and someone (smoser) can help you if you want to get started and need to find osmething that would make a good target for that.

 16:06 <smoser> * jamespage to send email on server seed [carry over)

 16:06 <jamespage> done

 16:06 <smoser> that looks to me to be done at done at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2013-December/037849.html

 16:06 <smoser> #topic Trusty Development

 16:06 <smoser> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule

 16:06 <smoser> we do have an alpha1 coming up on the 19th

 16:07 <smoser> and we're planning on alpha1 cloud images.

 16:07 <smoser> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:07 <smoser> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:07 <smoser> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-t-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:09 <smoser> i dont really want to walk through stuff there.

 16:10 <smoser> please just take a look at those bugs and if you *should* be working on them, do , and if you want to help out, pleease feel free for that.

 16:10 <smoser> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:10 <smoser> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-t/group/topic-t-servercloud-overview.html

 16:10 <smoser> as pointed out, we need to get that list updated.

 16:11 <smoser> jamespage and I and gaughen went through the list last week, and go tmost into reasonable order.

 16:11 <hallyn_> we might want https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/core-1311-cgroup-manager tracked there

 16:12 <smoser> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?searchtext=servercloud-1311

 16:12 <smoser> please follow up with gaughen to get that done, hallyn.

 16:13 <caribou> did someone had a chance to congratulate hallyn_ on making lwn.net's first page with that topic ?

 16:13 <smoser> :). lets hold that to the open discussion.

 16:13 <caribou> smoser: sorry, I coudln't resist

 16:13 <smoser> so for blueprints, the work item there is that you should work on your blueprints and the material they reference.

 16:14 <smoser> jamespage, or i or gaughen or jcastro maybe will make sure they get into that pretty tracker

 16:14 <smoser> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:14 <smoser> caribou, now its your turn to talk.

 16:14 <caribou> smoser: nothing on my end, thank you

 16:15 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (psivaa)

 16:15 <smoser> psivaa,

 16:15 <psivaa> smoser: no updates from us

 16:15 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:15 <smb> Nothing exiting from here. Finally completed the Xen MRE updates, starting with security, maybe return with more MRE. Xen from libvirt in Trusty currently broken. Looking at zul's ppa of 1.2.0 still seems to come up blank. ;) Started to look on bug 1258631.

 16:15 <ubottu> bug 1258631 in linux (Ubuntu Trusty) "instances fails to register GPT partition entries on virtio devices" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1258631

 16:16 <smoser> yeah, thanks for that smb

 16:16 <smoser> also, sforeshee did a bit of investigation for me on viability of a "server" kernel

 16:17 <utlemming> smoser: is there a bug for tracking that investigation?

 16:17 <smoser> the end goal would b to have a cloud image and default 'server' kernel that were the same. and that would give us a cloud image that "just worked" on most server hardware also.

 16:18 <smoser> this would likely cost us some size in the cloud image, but would make us more functional.

 16:18 <smoser> investigation continues.

 16:18 <smoser> utlemming, there isn't a bug. i can forward you (and anyone else) what sforeshee sent me on it.

 16:18 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:19 <rbasak> Nothing to report. Any questions for me?

 16:19 <smoser> #topic Open Discussion

 16:20 <smoser> #subtopic congratulations to the super rock star hallyn_

 16:20 <hallyn_> sigh

 16:20 <smoser> https://lwn.net/Articles/575672/

 16:20 * rharper claps

 16:20 <hallyn_> all right all right

 16:20 <smoser> hallyn_, why can't you just use systemd ?

 16:20 * smoser ducks

 16:20 <hallyn_> smoser won't let me

 16:21 <smoser> touche

 16:21 <smoser> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:21 <smoser> anyone have any thing here?

 16:21 <smoser> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:23 <smoser> the next meeting will be held in this same place exactly 603403 seconds from now.

 16:24 <caribou> smoser: is that octal or decimal ?

 16:24 <rbasak> caribou: base 10.

 16:24 <caribou> rbasak: roger that

 16:24 <smoser> hmm..

 16:25 <smoser> $ echo "next meeting is in: $(($(date +%s --utc --date="Dec 17 16:00") - $(date +%s))) seconds"

 16:25 <smoser> next meeting is in: 603313 seconds

 16:25 <smoser> caribou, feel free to fix that to do binary if you'd like.

 16:25 <smoser> next meeting:

 16:25 <smoser> Tue Dec 17 16:00:00 EST 2013
