 15:01:44 <slangasek> stgraber: hi :)

 15:02:06 * stgraber waves

 15:02:14 <stgraber> First report in a month or so. Been traveling, releasing 13.04, sprinting and finally back home.

 15:02:17 <stgraber> Feature work:

 15:02:19 <stgraber> - Image based updates (BLUEPRINT: foundations-1305-image-based-updates)

 15:02:22 <stgraber> - Finalized design of the whole solution during the sprint, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ImageBasedUpgrades

 15:02:25 <stgraber> - Implemented early proof of concept server-side at: https://phablet.stgraber.org (sprint channel)

 15:02:28 <stgraber> - Got a working test client at: lp:~stgraber/+junk/resolver-sprint-demo

 15:02:31 <stgraber> - Started rewriting the current server code to move from squashfs to tar.xz and run without privileges

 15:02:34 <stgraber> - Opened RT ticket for the server infrastructure

 15:02:36 <stgraber> - Trying to get the next steps for the GPG side of things sorted

 15:02:39 <stgraber> - Mobile sync and provisioning (OMA)

 15:02:42 <stgraber> - Spent some time discussing with Tony Espy about state of OMA CP in Android and how the ofono/android driver will deal with that

 15:02:44 <stgraber> Other work:

 15:02:47 <stgraber> - Merges. isc-dhcp merged, netbase synced, started looking at ifupdown and ifenslave-2.6

 15:02:50 <stgraber> - Changed dependencies of ltt-control as we now have lttng in the Ubuntu kernel

 15:02:53 <stgraber> - Bugfixes/SRU for LXC, cherry-picking high priority bugs into 13.04

 15:02:55 <stgraber> - Upstart in saucy now has user sessions enabled by default. The only Xsession script that had to be ported was gpg-agent.

 15:02:59 <stgraber> - Some work on the QA tracker to allow product leads to trigger rebuilds

 15:03:01 <stgraber> - Reinstalled my usual set of test machines on saucy

 15:03:04 <stgraber> TODO:

 15:03:06 <stgraber> - Continue porting the image based server side code to python3-tarfile

 15:03:09 <stgraber> - Get some kind of UI and API on the new rebuild feature of the QA tracker

 15:03:12 <stgraber> - Continue with the remaining merges

 15:03:14 <stgraber> (DONE)

 15:05:47 <stokachu> stgraber: that pattern matching for dhcp worked awesome

 15:05:51 <stokachu> thanks for that

 15:06:49 <slangasek> doko: around?

 15:07:24 <stgraber> stokachu: yay! should have thought of that before I applied that patch to 13.04, we could have save ourselves that patch entirely ;)

 15:09:15 <slangasek> ev: go ahead

 15:09:20 <ev> very short week - sprint last week, holiday Monday and Tuesday

 15:09:21 <ev> Stagingstack deployments of the entire infrastructure now exist as of the sprint - https://errors.staging.ubuntu.com/

 15:09:21 <ev> Spending my time getting the final bits done on the charms so we can go live on prodstack (OOPS reporting to a central server, handling our various cron jobs, etc)

 15:09:28 <ev> (done - iknowright?)

 15:09:52 <barry> :-o

 15:10:26 <slangasek> !

 15:10:38 <ev> ha

 15:11:05 <slangasek> * in Oakland last week - lots and lots of planning meetings :)

 15:11:05 <slangasek> * these will feed into the public discussions at vUDS next week - many of the relevant blueprints have already been registered

 15:11:08 <slangasek> * doing merges for saucy; merged kexec-tools, then ran into a terribly knotty acpica-unix NMU that needs serious fixing before getting merged

 15:11:11 <slangasek> * working on syncing Debian/Ubuntu on the upstart architecture

 15:11:13 <slangasek> * on vacation next week, so will miss UDS for the most part... if you have any sessions you need me at, be sure to ping me directly and I'll see if I can make it

 15:11:16 <slangasek> (done)

 15:11:19 <slangasek> xnox on vacation

 15:11:20 <slangasek> barry:

 15:11:35 <barry> - recovering from the sprint (i.e. getting my inbox to below 500 messages ;)

 15:11:40 <barry> - merging in and refactoring resolver fixes from the plane ride and stgraber's demo branch.  switching gpg code over to python3-gnupg which provides a somewhat more straightforward api (despite missing an necessary feature, easily hacked around).

 15:11:44 <barry> - lp:~barry/+junk/resolver is the canonical location and should now be up-to-date

 15:11:48 <barry> - lots of TODOs described in the branch.  top priorities include checking image zip signatures and plumbing through the reboot initiation.

 15:11:52 <barry> done.
