 20:23 <czajkowski> also to note I won't be voting in this application :)

 20:23 <SergioMeneses> welcome ubuntu irish team

 20:23 <PabloRubianes> Welcome to the Irish team

 20:23 <SergioMeneses> hey Laura appears in the picture jeje

 20:23 <czajkowski> thanks for coming airurando

 20:23 <czajkowski> photos do exist of me :)

 20:24 <SergioMeneses> nice

 20:24 <czajkowski> so airurando care to tell us how the irish team is doing ?

 20:24 <airurando> As our Team POC has forgotten I'll fill in

 20:24 <airurando> When compared against our activity up to June 2011 the last two years have been considerably quieter in the Irish Team.

 20:24 <czajkowski> no worries

 20:25 <airurando> Having said that there is still some significant activity in our LoCo.

 20:25 <SergioMeneses> airurando, does your team only have 4 ubuntu members?

 20:26 <airurando> SergioMeneses: yes I believe so.  2 former Ubuntu members appear to have let their membership lapse.

 20:26 <czajkowski> airurando: nods so teams do go through phases of being very active to being active in various ways

 20:27 <czajkowski> the very fact you guys care so much and are here today shows us the team is active

 20:27 <airurando> I became an Ubuntu Member earlier thus year

 20:27 <czajkowski> \o/

 20:27 <airurando> so net reduction is only 1

 20:27 <airurando> :-)

 20:27 <SergioMeneses> airurando, ok

 20:27 <airurando> lots of Ubuntu hours and release parties.

 20:27 <tdr112> airurando: has startes to do a lot of work to give thw loco some much needed cpr

 20:27 <tdr112> started

 20:27 <czajkowski> airurando: so what do you think is the best thing that works for the team, is it social events or just being there to support one another?

 20:28 <zmoylan> agreed

 20:28 <SergioMeneses> your wiki is pretty nice and a lot of information appears on it... airurando do you have some problems or ideas about your team that you want to share with us?

 20:28 <airurando> THe social events have worked great in the past but attendance has dwindles

 20:29 <tdr112> i think we have found it hard to get new blood

 20:29 <airurando> Aye, A lot of goodwill for the ongoing reboot effort.

 20:29 <airurando> The only real struggle is turning that good will into participation and acitvities.

 20:29 <PabloRubianes> tdr112: many teams have that problem

 20:29 <czajkowski> nods there does seem to be interest in the team, but sometimes it's hard to get people to step up.

 20:29 <SergioMeneses> tdr112, always is hard to find new blood

 20:30 <czajkowski> But a lot of teams find that so don't be disheartended

 20:30 <airurando> we have had some highlights over the last two years

 20:30 <SergioMeneses> czajkowski, ++

 20:30 <airurando> we will never get disheartened

 20:30 * czajkowski hugs airurando excellent

 20:31 <tdr112> thats true only last week we had a great ubuntu hour

 20:31 <airurando> indeed

 20:31 <tdr112> with some guests from the usa

 20:31 <costales> tdr112, great

 20:31 <airurando> Pete and Amber Graner were in town!

 20:32 <airurando> We had a good chat at that Ubuntu Hour

 20:32 <SergioMeneses> airurando, awesome, maybe some day I'll join to one

 20:32 <airurando> SergioMeneses: would love to have you over!

 20:33 <costales> airurando, Could we help you in something?

 20:33 <airurando> costales: not sure

 20:33 <tdr112> we would take some advice on getting new people

 20:33 <airurando> we have held and continue to hold straight talking meetings

 20:34 <airurando> tdr112 is right.

 20:34 <SergioMeneses> I think we are ready to vote

 20:34 <airurando> that is really what we need

 20:34 <costales> tdr112, It's complicate that point ;) A lot of teams have that problem

 20:34 <czajkowski> costales: perhaps give an example how your team gets new people

 20:34 <czajkowski> SergioMeneses: PabloRubianes same for you  guys :)
