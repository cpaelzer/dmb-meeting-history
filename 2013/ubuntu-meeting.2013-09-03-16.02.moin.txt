 16:11 * hallyn_ defers

 16:12 <jamespage> good oh

 16:12 <arosales> smoser, jamespage did vUDS allow for some good BP updates?

 16:12 <jamespage> looks like everything might have had a good catchup after uds last week

 16:12 <arosales> ah ok

 16:12 <jamespage> roaksoax, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms-ha-v2

 16:12 <jamespage> any updates?

 16:13 <jamespage> bah - we are stuck on the hard stuff - active/active rabbitmq and active/active mysql

 16:13 <roaksoax> jamespage: nope, I'll start this week to work on the charms (cause got distracted last week with toher stuff) right now in training

 16:13 <jamespage> I started to look at charming percona/cluster using upstream repositories

 16:13 <jamespage> it feel fragile still

 16:13 <jamespage> anyway..

 16:13 <smoser> arosales, i did a far amount of bp updates. if nothing else, vuds did give a reasonable time slot for that.

 16:14 <jamespage> smoser, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-simplestreams

 16:14 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-cloud-init

 16:15 <jamespage> so s'ok

 16:15 <smoser> jamespage, simplestreams is in correct state.

 16:15 <jamespage> zul, please can you update and re-plan https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-havana against remaining milestones

 16:15 <smoser> cloud-init i'm updating now.

 16:15 <zul> ack

 16:16 <zul> jamespage:  will do so this afternoon

 16:16 <jamespage> I don't think mongodb will make main this cycle - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-mongodb

 16:16 <jamespage> but hopefully we can figure out something with upstream for 14.04

 16:16 <zul> arrgh

 16:16 <jamespage> that said we are now ship-shape on OpenSSL + AGPL linking exceptions

 16:17 * jamespage thanks MongoDB for doing that

 16:17 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-s-openstack-charms

 16:17 <jamespage> adam_g, I think that needs an update post UDS session please; with milestones etc...

 16:19 <jamespage> thanks

 16:19 <smb> jamespage, thought I did update the bp

 16:19 <jamespage> smb; so you did - my mistake

 16:20 <jamespage> arosales, want to touch on the juju blueprints?

 16:20 <jamespage> I'm not so close to those...

 16:21 <jamespage> nope -OK

 16:21 <jamespage> looks like not to many issues anyway

 16:21 <jamespage> hallyn_, back to you

 16:21 <arosales> jamespage, I think we are good for this week

 16:21 <hallyn_> jamespage: thanks, moving on,

 16:21 <arosales> plus looks like I lost my chance :-)

 16:21 <jamespage> arosales, lol

 16:21 <jamespage> blink and you miss it

 16:21 <hallyn_> :)

 16:21 * arosales too slow

 16:21 <hallyn_> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:22 <hallyn_> plumber's is comgin up with several mini-confs (lxc, virt, security...)

 16:22 * smb will be there

 16:22 <hallyn_> any more coming up?

 16:22 <arosales> charm school this friday

 16:22 <arosales> https://juju.ubuntu.com/events/

 16:23 <arosales> How to use Charm Helpers

 16:23 <arosales> 1700 UTC (1pm EDT) 6 September

 16:23 <arosales> #juju on Freenode

 16:23 <hallyn_> and maybe what charm helpers are? :)  /me should consider listening in

 16:23 <hallyn_> ok, moving on,

 16:23 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:23 <arosales> yes if you don't know what charms are please join us and find out :-)

 16:23 <jamespage> charm helpers help you write charms in less code +10000

 16:23 <zul> lol

 16:24 <hallyn_> plars: psivaa: \o

 16:24 <hallyn_> we can come back if need be,

 16:24 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:24 <psivaa> hello

 16:24 <smb> too late ? :)

 16:24 <psivaa> no updaes from us btw :)

 16:24 <hallyn_> psivaa: ok thanks :)

 16:24 <smb> So just for that kvm bug mentioned before...

 16:24 <smb> I cannot say more than that is seems to be some regression with 3.11 (maybe 3.10 already). I just managed to write a lengthy email to the kvm mailing list this morning as I am not sure how to drill down further. Basing on 64bit Precise  and 64bit Saucy on level 1 for a level 2 should be mostly working but adding more saucy to deeper nesting is likely prone to fail.

 16:25 <hallyn_> smb: so 3.9-under-3.9 wouldn't have had this problem?

 16:25 <hallyn_> (I thought jodh was having trouble iwth earlier kernels, but maybe i mis-remember)

 16:25 <smb> hallyn_, I think only 32bit user-space in level 1 seems to have been broken a bit longer

 16:26 <hallyn_> oh. right.  we have multiple bugs?

 16:26 <smb> Likely

 16:26 <hallyn_> lovely

 16:26 <hallyn_> ok so, we're waiting on community to jump in.  this can be rperoduced with fedora or some other distros i assume?

 16:26 <smb> I hope but I have not tried

 16:27 <hallyn_> ok.  (mahbe i'll try later this week)  any other questions for smb

 16:27 <hallyn_> if not, we can move on to...

 16:27 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:27 <rbasak> Nothing new from me. Any questions?

 16:28 <hallyn_> (waiting 30 secs for responses)

 16:28 <hallyn_> great, let's move on to

 16:28 <hallyn_> #topic Open Discussion

 16:29 <hallyn_> anything?

 16:29 <rbasak> In case anyone is unaware, http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/triage-report.html needs some love.

 16:29 <hallyn_> oh yeah - can we do any automated cleanup of the likewise-open bugs?

 16:30 <hallyn_> jamespage: ^ that looks like yoru ba

 16:30 <hallyn_> bag

 16:30 <jamespage> golly

 16:30 <jamespage> yes

 16:30 <jamespage> I'll take a look

 16:31 <jamespage> but if the rest of the team can have a dirge on bug triage this week/next that would be helpful

 16:31 * jamespage holds up his hand for being a little neglegent on triage duty recently

 16:31 <hallyn_> jamespage: ok, thanks :)  i looked at some by hand, and actually they looked like not all the same causes - but it's hard to tell bc i don't know the package that well

 16:31 <hallyn_> i'd also like to consider taking all < 1000000 numbered likewise-open bugs and marking them all dups or something

 16:32 <hallyn_> but ok, let's say

 16:32 <hallyn_> [ACTION] everyone spend extra time triaging bugs this week

 16:32 * meetingology everyone spend extra time triaging bugs this week

 16:32 <hallyn_> so we can move on to

 16:32 <hallyn_> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:32 <hallyn_> Should be Tuesday Sep 10 at 16:00 UTC, with the magnificent roaksoax chairing

 16:33 <hallyn_> thanks everyone \o

 16:33 <hallyn_> #endmeeting
