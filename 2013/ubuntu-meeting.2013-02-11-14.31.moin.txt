 14:32:50 <bdrung> #meetingtopic Developer Membership Board

 14:33:28 <micahg_mobile> Didn't we do that already?

 14:34:23 <bdrung> #topic Ubuntu Contributing Developer Applications: Christopher Arges

 14:34:35 <arges> o/

 14:34:37 <bdrung> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/christopherarges

 14:34:53 <bdrung> micahg_mobile: just in case something's left.

 14:35:13 <bdrung> arges: hi. can you introduce yourself?

 14:35:32 <arges> ok

 14:35:51 <tumbleweed> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/christopherarges/CoreDevApplication

 14:35:57 <tumbleweed> ^ that's more useful

 14:36:13 <arges> yea that's pretty much what I was going to type

 14:36:23 <barry> arges: the link to your lp page on your application 404s.  what's your lp id?

 14:36:36 <arges> so as an FYI, I started with a core-dev application, but have changed it to a UCD application

 14:36:45 <arges> barry: launchpad.net/~arges

 14:36:59 * Laney finds signed advocacies amusing

 14:37:01 <barry> arges: thanks.  when you get a chance, please update your wiki page

 14:37:30 <Laney> arges: will we see you back applying for core-dev sometime soon?

 14:37:31 <arges> barry: ack

 14:37:32 <tumbleweed> Laney: esp because they only validate if you copy from teh source

 14:37:39 <arges> Laney: yes,

 14:38:16 <Laney> how are you finding the +1-maint stuff?

 14:38:34 <arges> Laney: great. I've done +1 twice, and the second time it felt a lot more natural

 14:39:02 <Laney> great

 14:39:08 <arges> Learning quite a bit about debian packaging and the process. I think I finally felt confortable towards the end of my last plus one where I would create a debdiff and feel extermely confident this was upload material

 14:40:09 * Laney has no more to ask ;-)

 14:40:42 <Laney> I was surprised when I saw you change your application - hope to see you come back soon

 14:40:59 <tumbleweed> on that topic, any idea when you'll be back for core-dev?

 14:41:07 <arges> Don't worry I will. : ) I'll get a few more uploads under my belt before then.

 14:41:59 <tumbleweed> I see you've been regularly sponsored by a few other people whose arms you can twist for endosrements

 14:42:32 <arges> tumbleweed: yup. I spoke with infinity about this, and he recommended I wait on the core-dev app which is primarily why I changed it

 14:43:02 <arges> But I also only emailed 3 people, and should bug more people for my next app

 14:43:09 <tumbleweed> yeah

 14:43:12 <tumbleweed> no more questions from me

 14:43:24 <stgraber> I'm ready to vote

 14:43:56 <bdrung> arges: do you forward your fixes to upstream/Debian?

 14:44:03 <arges> bdrung: absolutely

 14:44:09 <arges> submittodebian is my friend

 14:44:14 <tumbleweed> heh

 14:44:35 * Laney coughs

 14:44:39 <Laney> at least it's got one friend

 14:44:45 <bdrung> :)

 14:44:49 <arges> heh

 14:45:26 <bdrung> let's vote or does anyone have a remaining question?

 14:50:28 <stgraber> wendar: ping

 14:50:42 <bdrung> wendar: hi, please introduce yourself.

 14:50:59 * Laney loves http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/

 14:55:11 <Laney> ho hum

 14:56:41 <stgraber> I pinged her in private 25min ago without a reply, so looks like she's not around :(

 14:57:22 <bdrung> wake up, wendar

 14:57:50 <Laney> 2 minutes left :P

 14:57:53 <bdrung> The DMB has you.

 14:58:54 <bdrung> okay. let's defer her application to the next meeting on 2013-02-25.

 14:59:04 <stgraber> sounds good

 14:59:23 <stgraber> it'll also be later in the day so should work better for her (IIRC she's on PST)

 14:59:29 <bdrung> should we discuss the decoupling of the PPU from Ubuntu membership or end this meeting on time?

 14:59:40 <stgraber> I'd prefer we end the meeting

 14:59:47 <Laney> yeah

 14:59:54 <Laney> plus micah is gone and heh loves this topic

 14:59:59 <stgraber> ;)

 15:00:00 <Laney> he

 15:00:06 <bdrung> okay. thanks for coming. now i can use this command correctly:

 15:00:10 <bdrung> #endmeeting
