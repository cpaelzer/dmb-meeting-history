 16:33 <sbeattie> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Meeting

 16:34 <sbeattie> Since jdstrand and mdeslaur are off today, I'm chairing.

 16:35 <sbeattie> There's no announcements or actions to review this week.

 16:35 <sbeattie> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'll go first.

 16:35 <sbeattie> Once again I'm focused on apparmor stuff this week.

 16:35 <sbeattie> I'll be working on the items for the security-s-appisolation-sdk blueprint.

 16:36 <sbeattie> I also have a bit of stuff for upstream, including irritating jjohansen with design discussions.

 16:36 <sbeattie> That's pretty much it for me. tyhicks: you're up

 16:36 <tyhicks> I'm focused on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-s-appisolation-dbus-performance this week

 16:37 <tyhicks> I've got a little more benchmarking that I should finish up today

 16:37 <tyhicks> then I'll push the dbus rule syntax discussion a little more to completion

 16:38 <tyhicks> and I may also get started on the aa_log() libapparmor function

 16:38 <tyhicks> that's it for me

 16:38 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 16:38 <jjohansen> well I am chipping away at my blueprints as well

 16:38 <jjohansen> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/appdev-s-appisolation-signals-ipc-ptrace

 16:38 <jjohansen> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-s-appisolation-extended-conditionals

 16:39 <jjohansen> and of course arguing with sbeattie ;)

 16:40 <jjohansen> hopefully we can get the dbus, and default profile discussions completed this week and move onto the next set of arguments

 16:40 <jjohansen> sarnold: your up

 16:40 <sarnold> I'm on triage this week

 16:41 <sarnold> I've also got a back-burner project to take the fedora zlib environment variable thing for openssl -- some pci auditors are failing folks with postfix and tls for the flaw, and just providing them a way around rather than arguing seems like the best move

 16:42 <sarnold> local packages are built, just need some testing and building with the intention of aiming for -security-proposed, I believe

 16:42 <sarnold> front-burner is apparmor patch review for whoever can feed me patches :) (I think I've still got ~12 left from john's most recent patch flood)

 16:42 <sarnold> chrisccoulson: your turn

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> this week, i'm mostly focusing on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/client-1303-webkit-maintenance

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> i shouldn't need to do any updates this week \o/

 16:43 <sbeattie> yay

 16:43 <chrisccoulson> er

 16:43 <jjohansen> sarnold: I'm sorry your queue is getting low I'll make sure to top it up again

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> actually, there will be a fix for bug 1180227, but that's trivial

 16:44 <ubottu> bug 1180227 in firefox (Ubuntu) "Missing AppArmor rule for Firefox 21" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1180227

 16:44 <chrisccoulson> that's me :)

 16:44 <sbeattie> cool

 16:44 <sbeattie> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 16:44 <sbeattie> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 16:44 <sbeattie> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 16:45 <sbeattie> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 16:45 <sbeattie> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 16:45 <sbeattie> 

 16:45 * micahg-work will save his ranting about Chromium for another week perhaps

 16:45 <sbeattie> heh.

 16:47 <sbeattie> Alright, doesn't look like it.

 16:47 <sbeattie> ChrisCoulson, jjohansen, sarnold, tyhicks: thanks!
