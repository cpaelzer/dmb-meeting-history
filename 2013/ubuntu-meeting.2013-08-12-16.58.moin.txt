 16:58 <jdstrand> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Meeting

 16:58 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Announcements

 16:58 <jdstrand> Colin Watson (cjwatson) provided debdiffs for precise-raring for putty. Your work is very much appreciated and will keep Ubuntu users secure. Great job! :)

 16:59 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Weekly stand-up report

 16:59 <jdstrand> I'll go first

 16:59 <jdstrand> I'm on triage this week

 16:59 <jdstrand> I've got openstack updates to do

 16:59 <jdstrand> I need to test the latest upstart-app-launch

 16:59 <jdstrand> I want to implement the xdg user dir support in apparmor

 17:00 <jdstrand> I need to sync up with sarnold on code audits and give some to him since he is actually pretty good at completing them :)

 17:00 <jdstrand> I have a number of follow-ups on application confinement discussions

 17:00 <jdstrand> and patch piloting

 17:00 <jdstrand> mdeslaur: you're up

 17:01 <mdeslaur> I'm on community this week

 17:01 <mdeslaur> I have a couple of updates that need testing

 17:01 <mdeslaur> so I'll be doing that to try and get them released

 17:01 <mdeslaur> I'll also try and get the list down a bit since I go on vacation next week

 17:01 <mdeslaur> that's it for me

 17:01 <mdeslaur> sbeattie: you're up

 17:02 <sbeattie> I'm on apparmor again this week

 17:02 <sbeattie> I'm currently trying to sort out what's going on after being gone on holiday and at black hat

 17:02 <sbeattie> I have a bug or two in click-apparmor to fix

 17:02 <jdstrand> sbeattie: we should sync up

 17:03 <sbeattie> I also have a couple of black hat related items (expenses, trip report) to do

 17:03 <sbeattie> jdstrand: yeah

 17:03 <sbeattie> so that's pretty much it for me.

 17:03 <sbeattie> tyhicks: you're up

 17:03 <jdstrand> sbeattie: I took the liberty of making a few small changes to click-apparmor in support of the MIR request that I filed last week

 17:03 <sbeattie> jdstrand: kewl

 17:04 <tyhicks> This morning, I'll be preparing debdiffs against apparmor and dbus for AppArmor D-Bus mediation

 17:04 <jdstrand> sbeattie: you might want to pull 0.1.0 from the archive into your branch and review (btw, is there an official home for it?)

 17:04 * tyhicks pauses

 17:04 <sbeattie> jdstrand: not really outside of the +junk tree I have

 17:05 <sbeattie> we can move it to a more formal location under the security team

 17:05 <jdstrand> I think we may want to have it live somewhere, but we can talk somewhere else

 17:05 <jdstrand> yeah

 17:05 <sbeattie> yeah, sounds good

 17:05 <jdstrand> tyhicks: please proceed

 17:05 <mdeslaur> help the homeless

 17:05 * sbeattie presses play on tyhicks

 17:05 <tyhicks> :)

 17:05 <tyhicks> This morning, I'll be preparing debdiffs against apparmor and dbus for AppArmor D-Bus mediation

 17:05 <tyhicks> (yeah, yeah, you've heard that before but it is for real this time :)

 17:06 <mdeslaur> hehe

 17:06 <tyhicks> jjohansen will be pushing a kernel patch out that enables it for all Saucy users - until then, the dbus-dev PPA kernel will still be needed for mediation to be enabled

 17:06 <jdstrand> tyhicks: you mean fr saucy upload?

 17:06 <tyhicks> jdstrand: yep

 17:06 <jdstrand> \o/

 17:06 <mdeslaur> jdstrand: don't celebrate yet, it's a trap :P

 17:06 <tyhicks> hehe

 17:06 <mdeslaur> :)

 17:06 <tyhicks> Then I'll be working on my content-hub work items

 17:06 <jdstrand> you'll want to be prepared for everyone saying you broke everything :P

 17:07 <tyhicks> yeah, I'll probably need to plan in some support response time

 17:07 <jdstrand> probably a good idea

 17:07 <tyhicks> I imagine there will be questions

 17:07 <tyhicks> hopefully not too many bugs

 17:07 <tyhicks> After that, I'll work with jjohansen to add necessary APIs to libapparmor that allow trusted helpers to operate on AppArmor label sets

 17:07 <jdstrand> well, there may be no bugs-- doesn't mean you won't get blamed :P

 17:08 <tyhicks> true :)

 17:08 <tyhicks> Finally, I need to revise the dbus regression tests in the apparmor source tree for upstream approval and I also need to add tests for proper apparmor delegation when passing fds over dbus

 17:08 * jdstrand was referring to that scenario in his initial comment :)

 17:08 <tyhicks> I think that's it for me

 17:08 <tyhicks> jjohansen: you're up

 17:08 <jjohansen> I'm on apparmor again as well,

 17:08 <jjohansen> I've got to finish fixing a bug in the replacedby logic that is causing crashes when we enable compound labels,

 17:08 <jjohansen> I need to: look into the 3.11 flink/linkat changes http://lwn.net/Articles/562488/, push the kernel patch for the label query that dbus needs, deal with bug 1202161, prepare for tuesdays apparmor meeting, and then perhaps get back to the current apparmor work items

 17:08 <ubottu> bug 1202161 in linux (Ubuntu) "seccomp filter: execve(): Operation not permitted" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1202161

 17:09 <tyhicks> jjohansen: Good! I've been meaning to make sure you're aware of flink/linkat

 17:10 <tyhicks> I couldn't think of any potential problems for apparmor, but I'm sure that you can :)

 17:10 <jjohansen> tyhicks: well I remember seeing it, and making my self a note that got lost in all the other notes

 17:11 <jjohansen> yes it is going to rework some work around our link rules

 17:11 <jjohansen> but, I need to trace the security hooks because I don't think they are sufficient to mediate it

 17:12 <jjohansen> or more correctly currently only the inode hook is, mediating it

 17:12 <tyhicks> ah

 17:13 <jjohansen> anyways that it from me sarnold your up

 17:13 <jdstrand> sarnold: hold on a sec

 17:14 <jdstrand> jjohansen: I didn't recognize the IPC work items in your list this week-- would it be helpful/possible to shuffle some work around to free up some time?

 17:15 <jjohansen> jdstrand: sorry that is the "current apparmor work items" bit

 17:15 <jdstrand> jjohansen: related: flink/linkat is for 3.11-- are we going to ship 3.11 in 13.10 and if not, is that something we can/should put on the backburner for a bit?

 17:15 <jjohansen> jdstrand: saucy will be 3.11

 17:15 <jdstrand> ok

 17:16 <jjohansen> that isn't to say I won't go only as far as getting the info to file a bug on this item for this week, and deal with it later

 17:16 <jdstrand> oh, why was I thinking we had 3.10 still

 17:17 <tyhicks> I think the switch just happened

 17:17 <jdstrand> oh, hah, cause it happened today :)

 17:18 <jjohansen> jdstrand: no the switch happened last week when tim rebased to -rc4

 17:19 <jjohansen> we had issues in the 3.11 kernel where I couldn't even get the machine to boot in -rc2, and the kt was shaking out a couple issues in -rc3

 17:19 <jdstrand> maybe-- but I see 3.10.0-6.17 was only superceded a little while ago

 17:20 <jdstrand> (in saucy release)

 17:20 <jdstrand> anyhoo, doesn't matter

 17:20 <jdstrand> superseded

 17:22 <jdstrand> jjohansen: so, aiui, you've got the stuff you listed and you don't think it will take an inordinate amount of time (something that will take longer will be planned/done later) and you plan to work on ipc still?

 17:22 <jdstrand> is that accurate?

 17:22 <jjohansen> jdstrand: yes

 17:22 <jdstrand> ok, cool, thanks. sorry if I was being dense :)

 17:22 <jdstrand> sarnold: you're up

 17:24 <sarnold> I'm in the happy place the week; I've got (at least one) MIR audit (click-apparmor), and I've grabbed an update for maas to do. I may steal some of jdstrand's MIR audits as needed.

 17:24 <sarnold> and of course, if there are apparmor patches posted, reviewing them will be my top priority.

 17:25 <sarnold> I believe that's me

 17:25 <sarnold> chrisccoulson: you're up

 17:25 <chrisccoulson> hi

 17:25 <chrisccoulson> last week, i got firefox and thunderbird out. everything's been pretty quiet since then, which I'll assume is a good thing :)

 17:25 <jdstrand> \o/

 17:26 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: did you see my critical firefox bug?

 17:26 <sarnold> \o/

 17:26 <chrisccoulson> also, i added support for multiple browser contexts to oxide, which hopefully means that it's possible to have webviews with different profile folders now :)

 17:26 <jdstrand> neat :)

 17:26 <sbeattie> \o/

 17:26 <mdeslaur> \o/

 17:27 <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: that reminds me, I owe you and ubuntu-devel@ an email regarding oxide

 17:27 <sarnold> very cool :)

 17:27 <jdstrand> (that was one of the things I was planning to follow-up on this week)

 17:27 <chrisccoulson> i'm still working on the user script support, which i plan to continue this week. i wanted to get the browser context stuff out of the way first, as i'm making user scripts per-context rather than per-webview, and i didn't want to have to refactor everything later on :)

 17:28 <chrisccoulson> i'm  not sure if anyone has been following https://code.launchpad.net/~chrisccoulson/oxide/oxide.trunk ?

 17:28 <sarnold> sorry, no

 17:28 <chrisccoulson> that's ok ;)

 17:28 <chrisccoulson> i think that's me done

 17:28 <mdeslaur> chrisccoulson: wow, a lot of work in there

 17:29 <chrisccoulson> mdeslaur, yeah, it's slowly getting there :)

 17:30 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Highlighted packages

 17:30 <jdstrand> The Ubuntu Security team will highlight some community-supported packages that might be good candidates for updating and or triaging. If you would like to help Ubuntu and not sure where to start, this is a great way to do so.

 17:30 <jdstrand> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures for details and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-security. To find out other ways of helping out, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/GettingInvolved.

 17:30 <jdstrand> [TOPIC] Miscellaneous and Questions

 17:31 <jdstrand> sarnold pointed out that the community supported drupal7 packages could use some attention on earlier released (particularly 12.04). See http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/drupal7.html for details.

 17:31 <jdstrand> Does anyone have any other questions or items to discuss?

 17:37 <jdstrand> mdeslaur, sbeattie, tyhicks, jjohansen, sarnold, ChrisCoulson: thanks!
