 16:05 <hallyn> also not server i'm guessing

 16:06 <hallyn> ok, so nm the critical ones - anything you wanted to bring up here, Daviey?

 16:06 <Daviey> Nope. :)

 16:06 <Daviey> Things seem to be progressing well.

 16:06 <Daviey> Just really, make sure bluepritns are totally nailed. :)

 16:07 <hallyn> are there any that are worrying you?

 16:07 <Daviey> And do add WI's as more stuff appears

 16:07 <Daviey> hallyn: not specifically

 16:07 <hallyn> hm, yeah i might have some WIs to add...

 16:07 <hallyn> ok, do you want an action to do one more once-over on all our blueprints,?

 16:08 <hallyn> #action everyone look over blueprints one more time

 16:08 * meetingology everyone look over blueprints one more time

 16:08 <hallyn> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:08 <hallyn> anything coming up?

 16:08 <Daviey> Nothing I can think of..

 16:08 <Daviey> arosales: know of anything?

 16:09 <hallyn> ok, moving on

 16:09 <hallyn> #tpic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:09 <hallyn> bleh

 16:09 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:09 <hallyn> plars: all well?

 16:09 <plars> nothing big from me at the moment, there were some failures late last week with the server image

 16:09 <plars> but all is well now

 16:09 <plars> except the floodlight test still of course

 16:09 <arosales> Daviey, for events just oscon coming up

 16:09 <hallyn> awesome.  questions for plars?

 16:09 <plars> kernel team has a kernel to bisect for that

 16:10 <plars> going to try to get to it this week if I can, but the other guy that does production qa (psivaa) is out right now

 16:10 <plars> so I'm covering a lot at the moment

 16:10 <plars> will get to it as soon as I can

 16:10 <hallyn> thanks, plars

 16:10 <Daviey> plars: Thanks for the update

 16:10 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:10 <smb> Kernel is good (until we slap in 3.10 at least). Questions?

 16:10 <hallyn> your irc comment pasting reflex time may be better than the brake reflex time of most drivers around here

 16:10 <Daviey> smb: Are kernel uploads being regression tested against dkms packages yet?

 16:11 <smb> Daviey, Have you told us which?

 16:11 <smb> Officially I mean

 16:11 <smb> Or better plars

 16:11 <Daviey> smb: When this was last discussed, i suggetsed all dkms packages

 16:12 <hallyn> *

 16:12 <plars> smb: jibel mentioned yesterday that he has a prototype of this, not sure on the details other than that

 16:12 <Daviey> At least having a documented history of when the regression was introduced has value.

 16:12 <smb> This would be a few and maybe not all with a naming scheme to detect and not necessarily server related

 16:12 <Daviey> plars: Oh splendid.  Can you find out the details for next weeks meeting please?

 16:13 <plars> Daviey: why wait a week? I'll either send smb an email, or have jibel do it since he's closer to the action on that piece

 16:13 <Daviey> smb: Right, it's not actually that many.  Listing the reverse dependencies of dkms itself should suffice

 16:13 <smb> plars, Sounds good

 16:13 <hallyn> no action needed for that?

 16:14 <hallyn> ok, moving on

 16:14 <Daviey> plars: pls keep me in the loop

 16:14 <hallyn> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:14 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. Any questions for me?

 16:14 <hallyn> hi rbasak

 16:14 <jamespage> rbasak, is the go 1.1 issue in saucy resolved now?

 16:14 * jamespage is being lazy

 16:14 <rbasak> Oh, good question. I don't think there's been any progress on it. I need to follow up.

 16:15 <Daviey> rbasak: How are the arm saucy images looking?

 16:15 * rbasak makes a note

 16:15 <hallyn> #action rbasak to follow up on go 1.1. saucy arm issue

 16:15 * meetingology rbasak to follow up on go 1.1. saucy arm issue

 16:15 <hallyn> thanks, moving on in 3,

 16:15 <hallyn> 2, 1,

 16:15 <hallyn> #topic Open Discussion

 16:16 <hallyn> anything?

 16:16 <rbasak> \o

 16:17 <rbasak> Just a note for meeting chairs, while they're all here.

 16:17 <rbasak> There's been some confusion lately about what needs to be done after a meeting.

 16:17 <Daviey> good thinking

 16:17 <hallyn> There's a good list in the Knowledgebase

 16:17 <rbasak> I just wanted to point out that the steps are enumerated at the bottom of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/KnowledgeBase

 16:17 <rbasak> Right.

 16:17 <hallyn> yes, everyeone please follow that and fill in if anything is missing

 16:18 <hallyn> I think we've done a good job of keepign it uptodate

 16:18 <hallyn> thanks rbasak.  is there anything in particular that isn't being done?

 16:18 <hallyn> (regularly)

 16:18 <Daviey> specifically, "move yourself to the back" hasn't been done for a while it seems

 16:18 <rbasak> Sometimes minutes aren't being done also.

 16:19 <rbasak> It causes confusion in subsequent meetings, since action items go missing or are from older meetings that have already been resolved.

 16:19 <hallyn> i think it might help if we say it should be done by either thu or friday

 16:19 <rbasak> I think it's just due to all chairs not knowing that the process is documented.

 16:19 <rbasak> So now it's documented :)

 16:19 <hallyn> once it gets into monday, i think ppl feel that it's too late

 16:20 <hallyn> but i'll wait for someone else to recommend that :)  moving on?

 16:20 <rbasak> I think part of the problem is that individually we chair quite infrequently

 16:20 <Daviey> +1

 16:20 <hallyn> feels frequent to me :)

 16:20 <rbasak> A reminder at the end of the meeting might help. Perhaps we could add it as a standing action item in the agenda?

 16:20 <Daviey> rbasak: Fancy being the resident chair? :)

 16:21 * hallyn takes a step back and admires rbasak's team spirit

 16:21 <hallyn> :)

 16:21 <rbasak> As resident chair, I delegate the task of doing this week's minutes to hallyn :-P

 16:21 <hallyn> rbasak: a remidner at most should consist of a pointer to the wiki page

 16:21 <Daviey> +1, super

 16:22 <Daviey> remember, moin minutes are generated courtesy of meetingology.

 16:22 <hallyn> yeah but i prefer manually generated, actually meaningful notes

 16:22 <hallyn> moin generated ones aren't actually helpful imo.  just to fill in a chekcmark in your todo list

 16:22 <Daviey> True.

 16:22 <rbasak> I use the moin notes as a starting point

 16:23 <rbasak> But one step at a time. Step 1: do something for the minutes. Anything.

 16:23 <Daviey> The chair can take care to word their action points suitably to make a more useful autogenerated moin output

 16:23 <hallyn> #action rbasak consider telling hallyn to add a todo item to meeting checklist to remind meeting chair about the wiki page checklist.

 16:23 * meetingology rbasak consider telling hallyn to add a todo item to meeting checklist to remind meeting chair about the wiki page checklist.

 16:23 <rbasak> I'll do it now :)

 16:23 <hallyn> INVALID

 16:23 <hallyn> all right, moving on,

 16:23 <hallyn> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:24 <Daviey> same time, same place?

 16:24 <hallyn> That'll be next tuesday, June 18 at 16:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.

 16:24 <hallyn> thanks, everyone.

 16:24 <arosales> thanks for charing hallyn :-)

 16:24 <Daviey> thanks for chairing hallyn

 16:24 <hallyn> #endmeeting
