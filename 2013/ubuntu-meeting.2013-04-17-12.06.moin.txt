 12:11:02 <freeflying> Pendulum: thanks

 12:11:03 <pietro98-albini> Pendulum, yes

 12:11:24 <Pendulum> #topic Pietro Albini's Application for Membership

 12:11:38 <Pendulum> pietro98-albini: please introduce yourself :)

 12:11:56 <pietro98-albini> Hello everybody, sorry for my bad english :)

 12:12:13 <pietro98-albini> I'm Pietro Albini, a 14 years old italian boy

 12:12:47 <pietro98-albini> I started to contribute to the Ubuntu community in may 2012, into the Italian LoCoTeam

 12:13:22 <pietro98-albini> I manage the Ubuntu italian LoCoTeam website (http://www.ubuntu-it.org/) since may 2012

 12:14:02 <pietro98-albini> I made a lot of pages in the website, and with new Ubuntu release I release new site brand

 12:15:06 <pietro98-albini> I had the Ubuntu italian LoCoTeam membership since january, and since march I write for the LoCoTeam newsletter

 12:15:29 <pietro98-albini> When I've some free time I triage some bugs (very few)

 12:16:05 <jared> Thanks for the introduction, we're just reading over your application

 12:16:12 <jared> Is there anyone here to cheer pietro98-albini ?

 12:16:33 <pietro98-albini> jared, i don't finish yet

 12:16:40 <pietro98-albini> :)

 12:16:45 <jared> Sorry, please continue

 12:17:29 <pietro98-albini> The italian LoCoTeam is going to launch a new support system (the italian version of askubuntu) and I help to realize it

 12:17:45 <pietro98-albini> Probably I will admin or mod

 12:17:57 <pietro98-albini> https://launchpad.net/~pietro98-albini

 12:18:01 <pietro98-albini> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PietroAlbini

 12:18:06 * pietro98-albini finished

 12:18:33 * wickedpuppy claps , very good intro pietro98-albini  , well done!

 12:19:13 <smartboyhw> Erm I always appreciate (or push) teenage contributors to get Ubuntu membership, and I think pietro98-albini deserves it:)

 12:19:22 * smartboyhw is same-aged as pietro98-albini after all.

 12:19:36 <jared> pietro98-albini: you mention that most of your contributions are to your loco but launchpad shows you only joined in January this year, is that correct?

 12:20:32 <smartboyhw> jared, um that's a bit different (if you look at Launchpad)

 12:20:42 <pietro98-albini> jared, Ubuntu Italian LoCoTeam have two teams, ~ubuntu-it with all contributors, and ~ubuntu-it-members with members

 12:21:43 <pietro98-albini> pietro98-albini, I entered in ~ubuntu-it when I entered in ~ubuntu-it-www, and I entered in ~ubuntu-it-members in january

 12:21:57 * pietro98-albini finished

 12:22:15 * pietro98-albini cannot use correctly quoting

 12:23:28 <Pendulum> pietro98-albini: is there anyone around who could come cheer in support of you and how long you've been working other that the person who wrote your wiki testimonial?

 12:23:49 <pietro98-albini> hallino1 ?

 12:24:25 <jared> I just don't know what is involved in the other items you have listed on the wiki (other than the newsletter posts) and without more testimonials it's difficult to know how involved it is.

 12:30:10 <warp10> I'd like to speak in favor of Pietro. I met him within the Italian LocoTeam, and despite his age I have been impressed by his skills. I definitely recommend Pietro for the membership

 12:31:13 <micahg> warp10: can you speak to his level of contribution in the past before January?

 12:32:10 <warp10> micahg: sure, I met him in person during the ubuntu-it meeting in october 2012 (and he was already active in the community)

 12:32:50 <Pendulum> I think we're ready to vote

 12:32:59 <almaidinajad> I'd like to speak in favor of Pietro, too. I work with him in the Italian team that is responsible for the website. He never stop of working and everytime I'm in trouble there he is. I reccomend Pietro for the membership.

 12:33:05 <Pendulum> #vote

 12:33:05 <meetingology> Please vote on:

 12:33:05 <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, +0 or -1 in channel, (private votes don't work yet, but when they do it will be by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0 to me)

 12:34:15 <Pendulum> +0 I'd really like to see you come back in a couple months with more testimonials for how long you've been contributing.

 12:34:45 <jared> +0 I would like to see more detail about the sustained contributions to the Italian Loco website. I'm unable to see much activity earlier than January and there is very little detail in the small number of testimonials.

 12:35:20 <Destine> +0 more testimonials would be better.

 12:36:01 <freeflying> +0 if coming with more testimonials would make the application more persuasive

 12:36:22 <micahg> +0

 12:36:35 <Pendulum> #endvote

 12:36:35 <meetingology> No vote in progress

 12:37:11 <jared> pietro98-albini: I don't think we're saying you haven't contributed but it's hard for us to determine with the application as it currently is. If you'd like to hang around after the meeting we can provide more specific pointers but essentially, we need to be able to easily identify significant and sustained contributions.

 12:37:45 <Pendulum> next applicant. warren-hill are you around?

 12:37:47 <warren-hill> Here: launchpad https://launchpad.net/~warren-hill, Wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Warren-Hill

 12:37:56 <warren-hill> I'm a design engineer. I develop embedded systems

 12:37:58 <Pendulum> #topic Warren Hill's application for Membership

 12:38:07 <warren-hill> I'm mainly active on the Luaunchpad Ubuntu Answers site and I have found and confirmed a few bugs, but can be found on AskUbuntu, and occasionally Ubuntu forums too.

 12:38:15 <warren-hill> In Launchpad I'm currently 11th for karma on Ubuntu overall and 3rd for answers

 12:38:23 <warren-hill> More rarely I'm here in #ubuntu trying to help out.

 12:38:37 <warren-hill> What else do you want to know?

 12:39:32 <jared> warren-hill: we'll just read over and ask some questions :) Good work on the multiple testimonials from existing community members btw.

 12:39:58 <warren-hill> thanks

 12:40:35 <jared> warren-hill: so your design engineering I assume is not for Canonical?

 12:41:13 <warren-hill> No I develop electronic test equipment.  Some Linux based but most no OS

 12:41:38 <jared> warren-hill: no worries, just checking. I know they work on that stuff to a degree.

 12:42:49 <warren-hill> If interested this is the sort of equipment I work on

 12:42:51 <warren-hill> http://www.tti-test.com/products-tti/psu-main.htm

 12:43:41 <wickedpuppy> can I ask what programming language is used? Assembly?

 12:43:54 <wickedpuppy> C?

 12:44:15 <warren-hill> A mix of ARM assembly and C mainly, but some DSP assembly too

 12:44:38 <freeflying> warren-hill: why are you on the no-canonical team? just curious :)

 12:45:42 <warren-hill> you mean not canonical? Just because in the past some people have assumed I am a Conanical employee on Launchpad

 12:46:45 <freeflying> warren-hill: ic, thanks

 12:47:06 <jared> warren-hill: I've had a browse through your answers and read the testimonials, thanks for that.

 12:47:23 <jared> warren-hill: on a side note, how do you find the state of LP answers these days?

 12:47:41 <warren-hill> Generally OK why

 12:48:14 <jared> warren-hill: just curious, there were those who thought it declined a little when askubuntu came around, etc.

 12:49:24 <warren-hill> You get some poor questions but then many people are new.  AskUbuntu can be intimidating to some users as they can get told there is already an answer when they need more hand holding

 12:49:39 <Pendulum> Okay, I think we're ready to vote

 12:49:49 <warren-hill> My AskUbuntu page is here http://askubuntu.com/users/107450/warren-hill

 12:52:39 <Pendulum> #topic Billy Aung Myint's application for membership

 12:52:45 <wickedpuppy> thats me

 12:52:49 <Pendulum> wickedpuppy: Please introduce yourself :)

 12:52:56 <wickedpuppy> let me intro . thanks Pendulum

 12:53:29 <wickedpuppy> Hi everyone , I am 30 years old male in Singapore

 12:53:44 <wickedpuppy> I started using Ubuntu in late 2005 ,

 12:53:53 <wickedpuppy> https://launchpad.net/~wickedpuppy

 12:54:35 <wickedpuppy> I am one of the initiators of Ubuntu-SG loco team and administrator of the team @ launchpad

 12:54:48 <wickedpuppy> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sg-team/+members#active

 12:55:15 <wickedpuppy> I am also irc admin for #ubuntu-sg ( /msg chanserv access #ubuntu-sg list )

 12:55:37 <wickedpuppy> I am also moderator for Ubuntu-SG loco subforum on ubuntuforums.org

 12:55:55 <wickedpuppy> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=433

 12:56:01 <wickedpuppy> I am also mailing list administrator

 12:56:12 <wickedpuppy> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-sg

 12:56:25 <wickedpuppy> I am also the facebook page administrator

 12:56:31 <wickedpuppy> https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntu.sg/

 12:56:36 <wickedpuppy> you can see me there

 12:57:06 <wickedpuppy> I am also the web and domain administrator of ubuntu.sg

 12:57:25 <jared> Similar to the first applicant at the meeting, I'm struggled to be able to determine the significant and sustained contributions required to be a member. It's not that you haven't possibly done that but there isn't enough information available for me to draw that conclusion.

 12:58:08 <wickedpuppy> Sorry but being administrator and maintainer for local community isn't contributing enough?

 12:59:04 <jared> wickedpuppy: depends on the local community, if you can get some of the members to provide information on your contributions and length that would be the sort of thing I'd be looking for.

 12:59:26 <wickedpuppy> jared: we only have less than 200 members

 12:59:36 <wickedpuppy> only one ubuntu member , hyperair

 12:59:43 <wickedpuppy> we nearly died

 13:00:10 <wickedpuppy> we have just revived recently and are trying to get more members to the team

 13:00:22 <jared> wickedpuppy: I'm not suggestion they all need to :) Just with loco contributions it's really hard to guage involvement without some testimonials

 13:01:07 <wickedpuppy> I agreed. after all I could be hiding in the basement after registering the group

 13:01:11 <Pendulum> THey also don't need to be from ubuntu members. It helps if they're ubuntu members, but we do consider all testimonials.

 13:02:03 <wickedpuppy> then I think my chance are essentially 0. everyone would be too busy to come to irc even

 13:02:17 <jared> wickedpuppy: hyperair wouldn't be able to add a quick note to your wiki page?

 13:02:25 <jared> A couple of the others wouldn't be able to do the same?

 13:02:25 <hyperair> ohai.

 13:02:31 * wickedpuppy spanks hyperair

 13:02:34 <wickedpuppy> say something

 13:02:39 <hyperair> er

 13:02:40 <Pendulum> Testimonials don't need to be in English, btw.

 13:02:49 <jared> Gday hyperair , we're trying to ascertain wickedpuppy's contributions for Ubuntu Membership

 13:02:54 <wickedpuppy> lol .. something like wo ai ni :P

 13:03:32 <jared> They currently have no testimonials so I was saying it's hard to guage significant and sustained contributions to a loco without some sort of testimonial

 13:03:40 <hyperair> Pendulum: yeah well, i don't speak any other language as good.

 13:03:42 <warren-hill> They should not need to come on irc. Take a look at my wiki page can't you get a few users who know you to say similarly complementary things?

 13:03:59 <hyperair> well, what can i say, when i came to singapore, wickedpuppy was the ubuntu-sg team leader

 13:04:18 <Pendulum> hyperair: I menat that more in general about testimonials :)

 13:04:21 <hyperair> he led us for the SFD preparations since 2008

 13:04:21 <wickedpuppy> warren-hill: if they have wiki page account i would be very surprised ... Singapore team has less than 200 members in facebook and less than 20 active members

 13:05:05 <hyperair> wickedpuppy: well standard operating procedure for applying for membership -> wikipage writeup with testimonials.

 13:05:26 <wickedpuppy> hyperair: i know .. but you also know that would mean asking people to register for accounts

 13:05:34 * hyperair went through it for my MOTU application as well.

 13:05:44 <jared> wickedpuppy: they can also send emails to the membership board if they would prefer

 13:05:46 <hyperair> yeah well, can't be helped.

 13:06:20 <Pendulum> Also, if any of them want to continue to contribute long enough to become members themselves, they'll need the wiki account eventually.

 13:06:24 <jared> wickedpuppy: or, if you have write ups of the SFD events you organised, providing links to those on your wiki page. Along with other links of events that you've helped organise, run, attended, etc

 13:06:46 <wickedpuppy> Pendulum: they are not interested

 13:07:25 <wickedpuppy> We just had a meetup with Jouni Helminen

 13:07:33 <wickedpuppy> one of the lead designers of Ubuntu Touch

 13:07:38 <wickedpuppy> guess how many came?

 13:07:41 <wickedpuppy> less than 30

 13:07:51 <wickedpuppy> and mostly none ubuntu-sg members

 13:08:26 <jared> wickedpuppy: it's not the number that's important. It's the effort involved. I have had less than 20 attend release parties myself.

 13:08:35 <wickedpuppy> that is on facebook

 13:08:59 <wickedpuppy> jared: we havn't have any release parties for ... actually we never had

 13:09:03 <hyperair> we had once

 13:09:06 <wickedpuppy> once?

 13:09:07 <hyperair> many years ago

 13:09:09 <hyperair> chew hosted it

 13:09:12 <wickedpuppy> ah

 13:09:14 <hyperair> you were there...

 13:09:16 <hyperair> wait, were you?

 13:09:19 <hyperair> i remember heidir

 13:09:21 <wickedpuppy> no idea

 13:09:29 <hyperair> okay if you don't remember then you probably weren't there.

 13:09:40 <wickedpuppy> yah

 13:09:46 <hyperair> we also had an ubuntu-sg release party at NTU under the NTUOSS

 13:09:48 <jared> wickedpuppy: I'm just using that as an example though. I'm just saying it's difficult for use to gauge the required significant and sustained contributions when there is just a description of what you've done.

 13:10:23 <wickedpuppy> jared: I understand. I am not saying its unfair. I am just saying it would be almost impossible.

 13:12:33 <wickedpuppy> well I think in that case the conclusion seems to be foregone. Perhaps I will try again future

 13:12:37 <wickedpuppy> Pendulum: pls

 13:13:03 <warren-hill> There may be another option testimonials can be e-mailed to: ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com  according to this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership.  So users don't need a Wiki page to let the board know how good you are

 13:13:21 <warren-hill> but they still need testimonials

 13:13:25 <hyperair> i think we need some of the older members to come out and talk about wickedpuppy.

 13:13:33 <Pendulum> wickedpuppy: we'd like to see you come back with more testimonials and more links to show what you've done. I'd suggest talking to hyperair since he's been through the process.

 13:13:40 <jared> hyperair: even some links to recent events/efforts/etc

 13:13:45 <wickedpuppy> Pendulum: thanks

 13:13:55 <wickedpuppy> jared: Thanks too!

 13:13:57 <Pendulum> we really do want you to come back when you have more info for us. We just don't have enough as is to make a decision :)

 13:13:58 * hyperair was pretty new to the team -- we only met less than 10 times before the team more or less died out.

 13:14:09 <hyperair> then we came back once a year for software freedom day

 13:14:21 <hyperair> but last year the SFD committee disappeared

 13:14:25 <Pendulum> Okay, we're over time so I'm going to end the meeting.

 13:14:45 <Pendulum> Thank you everyone for coming
