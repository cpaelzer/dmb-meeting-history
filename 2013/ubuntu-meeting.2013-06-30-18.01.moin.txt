 18:11 <AlanBell> #topic Open items in the IRCC tracker

 18:13 <AlanBell> don't think we have any

 18:13 <AlanBell> and no pending emails

 18:14 <AlanBell> #topic Review Bugs related to the Ubuntu IRC Council

 18:14 <AlanBell> we need to do another review of expired members, I should file a bug for that

 18:15 <AlanBell> Unit193 pointed out the script was returning a few results to review, I went through some of them but there is a bit of a list to sort out

 18:15 <AlanBell> but other than that, no current bugs filed

 18:16 <AlanBell> #topic Replace floodbot kick+ban behaviour for webchat users who flood - tsimpson

 18:16 <AlanBell> we had a chat on this topic last meeting, not sure if any progress has been made since then, or if it is still an active proposal

 18:18 <AlanBell> I was going to mail the list about it, I will do that after this meeting

 18:18 <Tm_T> didn't freenode do some changes related to webchat?

 18:19 <AlanBell> Tm_T: yeah, which might mean some of the ban behaviour could change

 18:19 <Tm_T> ml good, yes

 18:19 <AlanBell> #topic Any Other Busines

 18:20 <AlanBell> anyone have any comments or questions?

 18:21 <AlanBell> ok, thanks everyone o/
