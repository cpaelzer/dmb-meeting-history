 16:00 <adam_g> o/

 16:00 <smoser> hello all and welcome to this weeks exciting adventure that we like to call the Ubuntu Server Team Weekly Meeting.

 16:01 <smoser> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:01 <smoser> wow. we had no shortage of actions from last weeks meeting

 16:01 <smoser> arosales to update Juju blueprints

 16:02 <smoser> no arosoles atm, moving on

 16:02 <smoser> roaksoax to clean-up iscsitarget packaging for 12.04.3

 16:02 <smoser> hallyn_ to confirm iscsitarget packaging done

 16:02 <smoser> roaksoax, hallyn_ ?

 16:02 <hallyn_> jamespage did that :)

 16:02 <hallyn_> (did the packaging - i confirm :)

 16:02 <smoser> k. good

 16:02 <smoser> Daviey to review 'dlm' in new queue for Saucy

 16:02 <jamespage> \o/

 16:03 <smoser> Daviey, ?

 16:03 <roaksoax> smoser: seems that jamespage took care of it

 16:03 <smoser> zul to follow up on mariadb/percona making it into Saucy

 16:03 <jamespage> roaksoax, yeah - I was on a roll for dkms updates...

 16:03 <smoser> hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:03 <hallyn_> that's less stable than i realized.  haven't progressed much

 16:04 <Daviey> smoser: done

 16:04 <smb> I think distracted would be a better word :)

 16:04 <smoser> arosales to update Juju blueprints

 16:04 <hallyn_> (haven't gotten xen 4.3 to work for me at all)

 16:04 <arosales> smoser, in progress for vUDS coming up

 16:04 <Daviey> smoser: dlm reviewed and accepted

 16:04 <smoser> ok. i'll push the xen item to next weke also

 16:04 * smoser hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:04 <smoser> #action hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:04 * meetingology hallyn_ to coordinate with zul and smb on testing xen 4.3 on nova

 16:04 <jamespage> smoser, you missed "jamespage to clean-up openvswitch packaging for 12.04.3 "

 16:05 <smoser> status ?

 16:05 <Daviey> jamespage: I started reviewing that for SRU, but not yet complete

 16:05 <jamespage> well as you ask :-)

 16:05 <jamespage> decided to take a different approach

 16:05 <jamespage> its actually only the dkms package thats not compatible

 16:06 <jamespage> and the user-space tools we have in 12.04 should be compatibile with a dkms module from raring

 16:06 <smoser> cool

 16:06 <jamespage> so we are going to backport lts-raring variants of the openvswitch-datapath-* modules to 12.04

 16:06 <jamespage> Daviey is reviewing

 16:06 <smoser> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <smoser> feature freeze is 29th.

 16:07 <smoser> i personally would like to see a cloud images beta1.

 16:07 <smoser> utlemming, can we just plan on that ?

 16:08 <utlemming> smosser: sure, I think that is a great idea

 16:08 <smoser> as always, please get / have blueprints in order.

 16:08 <utlemming> smoser: I'll plan on that happening

 16:08 <smoser> k.

 16:08 <smoser> anyone have anything else here ? or do we move to release bugs now ?

 16:09 <smoser> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:09 <smoser> hm..

 16:09 <smoser> #topic Release Bugs

 16:13 <jamespage> oh -thats a nice one

 16:14 <jamespage> not sure its a 'High' tho

 16:15 <smoser> i guess we should push that a bit upstream.

 16:15 <smoser> there aren't work arounds other than "don't do that"

 16:15 <jamespage> zul, any chance upstream will do something about that - its possible to have a broken nova api call right now

 16:15 <zul> ill look

 16:16 <smoser> ah. you can, Aaron Rosen's comment is quite good.

 16:16 <smoser> i agree, not High.

 16:17 <smoser> i'll assume matthias has that.

 16:17 <jamespage> I started looking at the merge for that

 16:17 <smoser> ok. good.

 16:17 <jamespage> but got uncomfortable as slangasek's upstart/init goodness appeared to get dropped

 16:17 <jamespage> so I pinged him then forgot - my bad

 16:18 <smoser> you're syaing its reported fixed in debian ?

 16:18 <smoser> oh. yeah, i see that.

 16:18 <smoser> k. never mind.

 16:25 <smoser> rbasak, could youjust take a look at that offline

 16:25 <smoser> make sure its not just getting missed

 16:25 <smoser> #topic Blueprints

 16:25 <smoser> link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-servercloud-overview.html

 16:26 <mdeslaur> smoser: I'm not currently working on the mysql package...if someone from the server team can take a look, I'd appreciate it, else it will have to wait until I get back from vacation

 16:26 <smoser> hm.. there is a lot of rred there, and we are near feature freeze.

 16:26 <smoser> mdeslaur, thanks for the follow up.

 16:27 <smoser> i think i'm generally just going to ask everyon e(and myself to take a look at your blueprints andensure that they're in a reasonable state)

 16:27 <hallyn_> yup, with ff a week away...

 16:27 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:28 <plars> -> psivaa

 16:28 <smoser> plars, anything ?

 16:28 <psivaa> no updates from the qa side

 16:28 <smoser> k.

 16:28 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:28 <smb> Currently working on bug 1208455 which jodh reported. But also would really want xen 4.3 to get into Saucy but the window closes. I do not think it would have a real impact on anything but xen-api, xen-api-libs and blktap. All tree look to be parts of the xen cloud platform (open source xen-server) from Citrix. And all three are FTBS even without the xen update. They only exist in the archive as they got pocket-copied over from previous re

 16:28 <smb> leases.

 16:28 <ubottu> bug 1208455 in linux (Ubuntu Saucy) "general protection fault running apt-get inside double nested kvm VM" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1208455

 16:28 <smoser> double nested ?

 16:29 <slangasek> s/double //

 16:29 <smb> smoser, yeah, in the end he uses 3 levels

 16:29 <smb> But the problem actually can be seen in the 2nd level already

 16:30 <smoser> wow.

 16:30 <smb> slangasek, So yeah, probably should remove the double there

 16:30 <slangasek> well, the three levels we care about are host, outer VM, inner VM

 16:30 <smb> smoser, Better do not ask _what_ he does, cause I don't know :)

 16:30 <slangasek> to be clear

 16:30 <jodh> smoser: ftr, all I'm trying to do is create a kvm instance that is controllable from the autopkgtest env. Just so happens that when I create my instance, there are already 2 instances behind me ;)

 16:31 <slangasek> smb: jenkins dispatches vms; integration tests for upstart requires booting under a test harness; thus, nested vms are required

 16:31 <slangasek> or else jenkins needs to dispatch to bare metal instead

 16:31 <rbasak> tbh, I think bug 1031680 will get missed. It's more in depth as it seems, and needs to be dealt with with care.

 16:31 <ubottu> bug 1031680 in nagios-plugins (Ubuntu Raring) "check_apt always report 0 critical updates" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1031680

 16:31 <ogra_> note that this bug seems to hold up an important fix for touch images

 16:31 <slangasek> ogra_: that's a separate discussion that I need to have with rsalveti today

 16:31 <ogra_> (the kvm one)

 16:32 <ogra_> ah, k

 16:32 <rbasak> Fundamentally it's an upstream bug, which tries to understand apt in a broken way, and fixing it is considerable upstream work.

 16:32 <smoser> slangasek, presumably a workaround would be to disable kvm

 16:32 <rbasak> A workaround is available.

 16:32 <rbasak> Not breaking compatibility is the difficult part.

 16:32 <slangasek> smoser: running qemu without paravirt? hmmmm

 16:32 <smoser> other than being painfully slow, that would workaround the bug.

 16:32 <slangasek> hadn't considered that

 16:32 <slangasek> well, "painfully slow" is the status quo

 16:32 <ogra_> speed is overrated :)

 16:33 <slangasek> we need to be able to do fast upstart integration tests

 16:33 <smoser> orders of magnitude performance affected i suspect.

 16:33 <smoser> yeah. its not a fix.

 16:33 <slangasek> if it's too slow, we can bypass it by running them locally instead

 16:33 <smoser> its a workaround

 16:33 <smoser> anyway.

 16:33 <slangasek> it's around, but it doesn't work for us ;)

 16:33 <smb> So far it seems that at least with Q and R as host and not running 64bit qemu on 32 bit guest things are more stable for me

 16:34 <smb> smoser, and that is with kvm enabled

 16:34 <smoser> oh wow. running 64 bit qemu in 32 bit guest ?

 16:34 <slangasek> ermm I hope that's not the way we're doing it

 16:34 <smoser> it just gets better and better :)

 16:35 <slangasek> jodh: ^^ are you really running 64-bit inner guest on a 32-bit outer guest?  If so, don't

 16:35 <ogra_> wow, that means we could also have arm64 under armhf :)

 16:35 <smb> slangasek, That was what jodh  was doing

 16:35 <jodh> smb: do we have a handle yet as to what is causing the kernel crashes? Does this need to be raised on lkml?

 16:35 <jodh> slangasek: no, I am not :)

 16:35 <slangasek> ok

 16:35 <smoser> i'm gonna move on here, and assume that slangasek, smb, and jodh can figure it out.

 16:35 <jodh> slangasek: well, not knowingly. But the distinction between 'qemu', 'kvm' and all the sym link horror of the multiple binaries might be doing stuff...

 16:35 <smb> jodh, You were using qemu-system-x86_64 in the guest that was i386

 16:36 <jodh> smb: I was using what was provided by 'kvm'.

 16:36 <slangasek> should we maybe take this elsewhere and not derail the meeting in progress? :)

 16:36 <jodh> which is what autopkgtest does

 16:36 <smoser> yeah, please take up in #ubuntu-server.

 16:36 <smb> slangasek, agree to take it away

 16:36 * smoser is interested, but this is a bit long here.

 16:36 <smoser> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:37 <smoser> rbasak, do we have a kernel that we could put in the cloud iamges ? i tihnk we hvae no maas images for ephemerla for saucy at the moment due to lack of sufficent kernel...

 16:37 <smoser> i suppose i should have a bug on that, but i do not.

 16:37 <utlemming> smoser: the saucy ephemeral arm images are back to normal now...it was a qemu bug

 16:37 <rbasak> smoser: we have a generic kernel now

 16:38 <rbasak> That would do.

 16:38 <smoser> utlemming, oh? ok. that is good. well i will raise bug if there is an issue.

 16:38 <rbasak> I'll need to check exact status, but the general plan is to have lpae and non-lpae variants

 16:38 <smoser> what is the 'generic' kernel ?

 16:38 <smoser> just actually 'generic' like on other arch ?

 16:38 <utlemming> I think there is going to be some issues since we are using the OMAP kernel with the OMAP loaders.

 16:38 <rbasak> Yes, but there are a limited number of platforms that support it. Hopefully that number will grow

 16:38 <utlemming> rbasak: we should sync tomorrow morning on this

 16:39 <rbasak> ack

 16:39 <smoser> cool. thanks rbasak utlemming .

 16:39 <smoser> +1 for growing number of platforms

 16:39 <smoser> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:39 <smoser> anyone have anything here?
