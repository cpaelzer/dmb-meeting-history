 16:00 <hallyn> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:00 <hallyn> Previous meeting minutes at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20131126

 16:01 <hallyn> ?

 16:01 <hallyn> what as that about?

 16:01 <hallyn> i'll assume it's a mistake and move on,

 16:01 <hallyn> smoser sync with utlemming on building cloud images for alpha 1, targets = seed-review, gpt

 16:01 <smoser> hm... utlemming ^ ?

 16:01 <smoser> lets mark that done, and i'll do it now.

 16:02 <hallyn> ok

 16:02 <hallyn> jamespage do seed-review email

 16:02 <hallyn> saw it on the list i think

 16:02 <hallyn> jamespage, gaughen review blueprints and accept for trusty

 16:02 <utlemming> hallyn: cloud images will have an alpha 1

 16:02 <gaughen> hallyn, we did that yesterday, it's partially done

 16:02 <hallyn> ok, won't renew the action item then, thanks

 16:02 <hallyn> gaughen file bug with status.u.c to get ubuntu server topic tracking in there

 16:03 <gaughen> not done

 16:03 <hallyn> [ACTION] gaughen file bug with status.u.c to get ubuntu server topic tracking in there  (carry over)

 16:03 * meetingology gaughen file bug with status.u.c to get ubuntu server topic tracking in there  (carry over)

 16:03 <hallyn> thanks

 16:03 <hallyn> all: write up blueprints, and have them ready for review by November 28

 16:03 <hallyn> were we all good boys and girls?

 16:04 <gaughen> smoser?

 16:04 <gaughen> were you a good boy?

 16:04 <smoser> never

 16:04 <gaughen> lol

 16:04 <smoser> but i have 1 of 3 done-ish.

 16:04 <smoser> i will work on others.

 16:04 <hallyn> well deadline passed so wwon't renew that :)

 16:04 <hallyn> moving on,

 16:04 <hallyn> [TOPIC] T Development Opening

 16:04 <gaughen> based on our review yesterday, we do have updates for some folks to make to the blueprints

 16:04 <hallyn> who wants to take this?

 16:04 <gaughen> and of course smoser

 16:05 <hallyn> jamespage: arosales: ^

 16:05 <arosales> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule

 16:05 <jamespage> hallyn, sure

 16:06 <jamespage> so start-ish of cycle still

 16:06 <jamespage> get those blueprints updated as per gaughen's feedback

 16:06 <jamespage> but not looking to bad

 16:06 <arosales> Dec 19 for Alpha 1 which sounds like utlemming is going to cut a cloud image for

 16:06 <jamespage> sensible BP's for an lts

 16:06 <hallyn> ok, thanks - moving on

 16:06 <jamespage> merges and syncs still important focus right now - we need to get version bumps in early as possible

 16:07 <hallyn> ah.  where is the url with theh list of not-done merges/syncs?

 16:07 <jamespage> everyone should know about 'grep-merges' - its easier than going to merges.ubuntu.com

 16:08 <hallyn> hm,  ok

 16:08 <hallyn> [TOPIC] Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:08 <jamespage> hallyn, I think rbasak did some work on a server focussed merge report but I don't know where that lives

 16:08 <hallyn> jamespage: do you want an action for ppl to look at merges?

 16:08 <jamespage> yes please

 16:09 <hallyn> [ACTION] everyone look at grep-merges output and merge/sync as much and early as possible

 16:09 * meetingology everyone look at grep-merges output and merge/sync as much and early as possible

 16:09 <hallyn> jamespage: thanks

 16:09 <hallyn> caribou is not here

 16:09 <hallyn> does anyone else want to say anything about server/cloud bugs?

 16:09 <hallyn> going once,

 16:09 <jamespage> hrm

 16:09 <jamespage> I know one that is hitting caribou and his guys right now

 16:10 <jamespage> bug 1241674

 16:10 <hallyn> that is appropriate to discuss here?

 16:10 <ubottu> bug 1241674 in juju-core "juju-core broken with OpenStack Havana for tenants with multiple networks" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1241674

 16:10 <jamespage> yeah - it is

 16:10 <hallyn> carry on :)

 16:10 <jamespage> I poked the upstream owner on that one

 16:10 <jamespage> he's promised to update the bug report

 16:10 <jamespage> with details on plans etc...

 16:11 <hallyn> i don't see a link to upstream bug... who is the owner?

 16:11 <hallyn> anyone here?

 16:13 <jamespage> hallyn, mgz

 16:13 <jamespage> sorry

 16:13 <arosales> looks like jamespage filed :-)

 16:13 <arosales> and there he is

 16:13 <jamespage> mgz is the upstream owner

 16:14 <hallyn> ...  do you want an action for yourself relating to this?

 16:14 <hallyn> (or anyone else...)

 16:14 <arosales> and 1241674 is the upstream bug

 16:14 <hallyn> arosales: then why isn't mgz marked as owner?

 16:14 <arosales> jamespage, any action for ubunt server here?

 16:14 <jamespage> no its all upstream right now
