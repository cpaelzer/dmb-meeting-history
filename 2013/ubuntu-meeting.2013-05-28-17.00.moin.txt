 17:01 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] ARM Status (ppisati)

 17:01 <ppisati> Q/master: lp1176977 ("XFS instability on armhf under load") - cherry picked two

 17:01 <ppisati> more patches that address the free space fragmentation: the resulting kernel

 17:01 <ppisati> passes all tests so far, i'm waiting for user feedback and one last batch of

 17:01 <ppisati> tests.

 17:01 <ppisati> */highbank: lp1182637("cpu_offlining fails to run on ARM") - all the highbanks kernel that

 17:01 <ppisati> we released so far are affected by this - basically, you can offline a cpu but

 17:01 <ppisati> when you try to put it back, reinsetion fails and the only way to get the cpu back

 17:01 <ppisati> is to reboot. Debugged till the point the cpu is plugged back, but it never really

 17:01 <ppisati> starts and pick up the idle thread - i'll probably need to do a comparison

 17:01 <ppisati> between the boot environment (when the cpu are added to the system via the same

 17:01 <ppisati> mechanism) and this scenario.

 17:01 <ppisati> ..

 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Release Metrics and Incoming Bugs (jsalisbury)

 17:02 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Milestone Targeted Work Items (ogasawara)

 17:02 <ogasawara> [LINK] https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-distro-team/+upcomingwork

 17:02 <ogasawara> [LINK] http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/canonical-kernel-distro-team.html

 17:02 <ogasawara> I'm still working on cleaning up our team's set of work items and

 17:02 <ogasawara> getting monthly goals properly refelcted in the blueprints.

 17:02 <ogasawara> ..

 17:03 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: Saucy Development Kernel (ogasawara)

 17:03 <ogasawara> Our Saucy unstable branch has been rebased to the latest v3.10-rc3

 17:03 <ogasawara> upstream kernel.  Saucy master-next is currently at v3.9.3.  I

 17:03 <ogasawara> anticipate we'll cut over to v3.10 around the -rc4 time frame.

 17:03 <ogasawara> On the phablet side, we now have Ubuntu kernels in the archive for the

 17:03 <ogasawara> Nexus 4, 7, 10, and Galaxy Nexus devices.  We also anticipate an

 17:03 <ogasawara> AppArmor pull request next week from the security team to get the latest

 17:03 <ogasawara> AppArmor patches into these kernels.

 17:03 <ogasawara> Important upcoming dates:

 17:03 <ogasawara> Thurs June 20 - Alpha 1 (opt in)

 17:03 <ogasawara> ..

 17:03 * rtg is going to upload v3.9.4 saucy today

 17:03 <jsalisbury> [TOPIC] Status: CVE's (sconklin)

 17:04 <sconklin> == 2013-05-28 (7 days) ==

 17:04 <sconklin> Currently we have 63 CVEs on our radar, with 0 CVEs added and 0 CVEs retired in the last week.
